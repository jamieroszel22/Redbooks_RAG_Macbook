# Next Steps for GitHub Integration

Follow these steps to connect your containerized IBM Redbooks RAG system to GitHub:

## 1. Run the git_setup.bat script

Open Command Prompt in your project directory and run:
```
git_setup.bat
```

This will initialize a Git repository, add your files, create an initial commit, and set up the GitHub remote.

## 2. Push to GitHub

After running the setup script, push your code to GitHub:
```
git push -u origin main
```

You will need to authenticate with GitHub. If you've set up SSH keys, this should work automatically. Otherwise, you may need to enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

## 3. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow

After pushing to GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/jamieroszel22/docling_rag
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. You should see the "Docker Build Test" workflow running

## 4. Set up branch protection (optional)

For better repository management:
1. Go to https://github.com/jamieroszel22/docling_rag/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
4. Check "Require pull request reviews before merging"
5. Click "Create"

## 5. Enable GitHub Issues (optional)

To track bugs and feature requests:
1. Go to https://github.com/jamieroszel22/docling_rag/settings
2. Scroll down to "Features"
3. Make sure "Issues" is enabled

## 6. Set up a project description

1. Go to https://github.com/jamieroszel22/docling_rag
2. Click the gear icon next to "About" on the right sidebar
3. Add a description and topics (e.g., "rag", "llm", "ibm", "docling", "docker")

## 7. Create an initial release

Once everything is working properly:
1. Go to https://github.com/jamieroszel22/docling_rag/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag version: v1.0.0
4. Release title: "Initial Release"
5. Add release notes describing your containerized system
6. Click "Publish release"

Your IBM Redbooks RAG system is now properly connected to GitHub and ready for collaboration!
