  "content": "tasks, such as content generation, dynamic interaction with users, or collaborative reasoning. In a software-based MAS, each agent operates autonomously while adhering to predefined protocols for communication and collaboration. This autonomy enables agents to handle tasks like distributed resource management, adaptive problem-solving, and even creative endeavors, such as generating ideas, plans, or personalized user experiences. Gen AI further amplifies their function by enabling natural language generation, image synthesis, and decision-making support, which enhances the agents' ability to interpret, reason, and produce outputs in real time. A key challenge in software-based MASs, particularly ones that leverage gen AI, is achieving effective inter-agent communication and collaboration. Protocols that are based on message-passing, such as JSON over RESTful APIs or advanced graph-based communication models, help ensure that agents can share knowledge, negotiate responsibilities, and",
