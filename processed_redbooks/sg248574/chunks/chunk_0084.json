Tools for diverse data science teams 21 Figure 3-1 AutoAI experiment on IBM watsonx.ai Although AutoAI is a no-code tool, the ML pipelines that are generated by an AutoAI experiment can be exported as a notebook. Therefore, more experienced data scientists can view the code \u201cunder the hood\u201d and make modifications and updates to the underlying code. Figure 3-2 shows an example notebook that was created from a pipeline that was generated from an AutoAI experiment.
