Beyond efficiency, AI agents also bring about significant cost savings by automating repetitive tasks, reducing human error, and improving operational accuracy. Their ability to adapt from experience by using a memory module and to adapt to novel situations is crucial in addressing problems where predefined solutions are inadequate. For example, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques enable AI agents to optimize behavior over time, which refines their decision-making capabilities with minimal human input. By acting as adaptive problem solvers, AI agents provide a bridge between theoretical AI research and practical, real-world enterprise-grade applications. Figure 6-4 shows the gen AI journey for AI agents. Figure 6-4 Generative AI journey for AI agents Agents that are powered by LLMs represent the next frontier in driving productivity gains for enterprises. As",
