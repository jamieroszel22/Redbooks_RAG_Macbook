The orchestration layer further optimizes performance by streamlining the deployment and management of agents, which minimizes operational overhead while maximizing system reliability. The overall interaction flow in Figure 6-10 on page 105 begins with the user engaging with the Unified Assistant. The user\u2019s input is processed by the Supervisory AI Meta-Agent, which applies its routing, reasoning, and tool-calling capabilities to determine the best course of action. Then, tasks are delegated to the appropriate assistants, which run them autonomously by using the integrated tools and workflows. The outputs and actions from these assistants are aggregated by the meta-agent and presented to the user, which helps ensure a cohesive and intuitive experience. This flow highlights the system\u2019s ability to handle diverse and complex tasks while maintaining a simple interface. In conclusion, watsonx.ai agents represent a revolutionary approach",
