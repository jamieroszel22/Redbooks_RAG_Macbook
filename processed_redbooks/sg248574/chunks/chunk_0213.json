An AI agent, as illustrated in Figure 6-2 on page 91, consists of a centralized planning system that is supported by a general-purpose generative LLM. This LLM serves as the core orchestrator, which can devise a structured plan of actions to address user queries. Its decision-making process is enhanced by a memory module, which maintains contextual information and is continuously updated based on past actions and outcomes, which help ensure adaptive and dynamic responses.

Artificial intelligence agents 91 Figure 6-2 High-level view at the core of an AI agent The planning system interacts with an I/O communication layer to run the planned actions effectively. This layer acts as a bridge between the LLM and an extensive Tool Library, which enables the agent to perform specialized tasks beyond its intrinsic capabilities. The",
