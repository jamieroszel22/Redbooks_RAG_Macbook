Advanced capabilities of watsonx.ai 83 Figure 5-14 InstructLab fine-tuning process with real-time performance on the 2-phase fine-tuning process with replay buffer In the initial phase, the pre-trained models undergo a rigorous training regimen by using targeted datasets that are pertinent to the specific knowledge areas that are identified within the taxonomy tree. This phase focuses on adapting the general-purpose models to the specialized requirements of the InstructLab projects, which hone their performance to meet the specifications. The second phase uses the skills and continues catastrophic forgetting by using a dedicated replay buffer while fine-tuning the skills in the second phase. The replay buffer mechanism plays a crucial role in this fine-tuning process. By systematically storing and replaying past experiences (training data and model states) during the training sessions, the buffer helps",
