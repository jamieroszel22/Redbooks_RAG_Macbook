These models, such as Granite, are pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets, enabling them to adapt to specific applications with minimal fine-tuning. Unlike traditional ML models that are tailored to single tasks, FMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to excel in multiple domains. This adaptability is achieved through transfer learning, where the model's pre-trained weights are fine-tuned on domain-specific data sets. FMs empower organizations to reduce the cost and complexity of training AI systems while achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like natural language understanding, summarization, and multimodal reasoning. Leveraging AI for competitive advantage To thrive in an AI-driven landscape, organizations must strategically harness AI technologies to drive innovation, enhance",
