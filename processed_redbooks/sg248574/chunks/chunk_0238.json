By enabling human intervention, the system can address unforeseen complexities, validate decisions, and maintain control over critical operations. Task decomposition ensures that even complex objectives are approached methodically, with subtasks delegated to the appropriate agents or tools. Collaboration within the MAS is further enhanced through sophisticated communication patterns, which define how agents interact and share information. The architecture supports multiple communication patterns: \u0002 Layered communication: Hierarchical interactions where agents operate at different levels of abstraction by passing information up or down the chain. \u0002 Decentralized communication: Peer-to-peer exchanges among agents to help ensure",
