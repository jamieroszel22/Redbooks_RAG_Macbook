For example, selecting a training profile helps ensure compatibility with your hardware, whether it uses CPUs or GPUs, to provide the best performance and resource optimization for your setup: 1. Clone the taxonomy repository, either interactively or by specifying a path with the --taxonomy-path flag. 2. Specify the path to your model. By default, it uses a quantized Granite model. 3. Select a training profile. For systems without dedicated GPUs, choose No Profile (CPU, Apple Metal, AMD ROCm). After initialization, the directories that are shown in Table 5-1 are created. Table 5-1 ilab directory overview and details Directory Description ~/.cache/instructlab/models/ Contains downloaded models. ~/.local/share/instructlab/datasets/ Stores the dataset outputs that are generated during workflows. ~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/ Contains skill and knowledge data from the taxonomy repository.",
