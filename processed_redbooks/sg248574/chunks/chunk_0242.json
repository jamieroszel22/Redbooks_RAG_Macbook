By integrating human feedback into the loop, particularly for infinite loops or rogue paths, the MAS can maintain a high degree of reliability and robustness by implementing a fail-safe technique on human-in-the-loop interaction after deviant agents\u2019 behavior is detected by the overall orchestration system. This hybrid approach of automation with human oversight is especially critical in high-stakes domains where errors can have significant consequences. The MAS operates within an environment, such as the external world or a digital context where tasks are performed and results are applied. Agents interact with the environment by observing its state, acting to modify it, and processing feedback to refine their belief states and policies. The environment is also where the whole MAS runs, and it is possible to have environments that are composed of multiple locations, such as cloud environments, virtual machines (VMs) and containers, or further proprietary software. 6.4 AI agents",
