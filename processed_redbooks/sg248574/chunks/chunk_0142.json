Conversely, smaller batch sizes enable greater granularity in gradient computations, which is advantageous for small datasets or specific tasks. However, small batches introduce noisier gradient updates, which require more iterations to converge effectively. To optimize batch size, practitioners should aim for a balance that satisfies computational feasibility while meeting the requirements of the task. Dynamic batch sizing (adjusting the batch size during training) can further stabilize the learning process and enhance overall effectiveness. \u0002 The number of epochs represents the total number of complete passes that the training algorithm makes through the dataset. This parameter directly influences how thoroughly the model explores the data to refine its prompt parameters. A higher number of epochs allows the model to capture",
