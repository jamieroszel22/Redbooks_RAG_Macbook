This AI studio provides a range of FMs, training and tuning tools, and a cost-effective infrastructure that facilitates the entire data and AI lifecycle, from data preparation through model development, deployment, and monitoring. The studio also includes an FM library that provides IBM\u00ae curated and trained FMs. FMs use a large, curated set of enterprise data that is backed by a robust filtering and cleansing process, and with an auditable data lineage. These models are trained on language and other modalities, such as code, time-series data, tabular data, geospatial data, and IT events data. x Simplify Your AI Journey: Unleashing the Power of AI with IBM watsonx.ai Here are some examples of the model categories: \u0002 fm.code: Models that automatically generate code for developers through a natural-language interface to boost developer productivity and enable the",
