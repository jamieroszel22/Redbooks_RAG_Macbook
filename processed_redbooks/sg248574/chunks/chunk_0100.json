Building and using artificial intelligence models 35 4.5.2 Preparing and cleaning data: data quality considerations Data quality is a critical factor in the success of AI models because it directly influences their performance and accuracy. Here are some key considerations: \u0002 Accuracy: Ensuring that data is correct, consistent, and error-free is vital for creating reliable AI models. Inaccurate data can lead to faulty predictions and flawed decision-making. \u0002 Completeness: AI models rely on comprehensive datasets to learn effectively. Missing data can skew results, which cause incomplete or biased predictions. \u0002 Consistency: Data must be consistent across different sources and formats to help ensure the AI model functions as expected. \u0002 Relevance: Data should be pertinent to the problem the AI aims to solve. Irrelevant data might introduce noise and reduce model effectiveness. \u0002 Bias and fairness: Addressing data biases and ensuring fairness are",
