Even with the right data and parameters in place, fine-tuning remains computationally demanding. Training these large LLMs requires access to high-performance hardware, such as multi-GPU, along with robust memory and storage capabilities. For organizations without dedicated AI infrastructure, these requirements are often prohibitive. \u0002 Ensuring stability during the training process: Large-scale optimization algorithms are prone to issues like exploding or vanishing gradients, so achieving convergence without diverging from the optimal solution requires careful tuning and monitoring. 5.3.2 How watsonx.ai addresses fine-tuning challenges By automating the complexities of fine-tuning, watsonx.ai transforms what was once a labor-intensive and technically demanding process into an",
