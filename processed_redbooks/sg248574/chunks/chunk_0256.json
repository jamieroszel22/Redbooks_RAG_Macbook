The assistants also facilitate user interactions by maintaining context, understanding intent, and responding dynamically to evolving requirements. A defining feature of this architecture is its reliance on tool calling, which forms the backbone of the system\u2019s operational flexibility and extensibility. Figure 6-10 on page 105 emphasizes the integration of various categories of tools that the agents can call to complete tasks. These tools include fixed flows for handling repetitive and standardized operations; knowledge repositories for answering questions and providing insights; APIs for interacting with external systems; business automation modules for streamlining enterprise processes; and multi-agent frameworks for coordinating complex tasks that require collaboration among several AI agents. The usage of LLM-based tool calling helps ensure that the system can adapt to various workflows, which enables interoperability with existing IT",
