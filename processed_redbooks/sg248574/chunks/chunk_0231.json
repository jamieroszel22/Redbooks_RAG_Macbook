Artificial intelligence agents 97 The architectural diagram in Figure 6-5 outlines a sophisticated MAS framework that is designed to integrate diverse functions such as planning, memory management, communication, and task orchestration. The system employs a modular design that facilitates scalability, adaptability, and interoperability, which caters to complex problem-solving scenarios across various domains. Let us delve into each component and their interplay within the architecture. Figure 6-5 High-level view of a multi-agent system architecture A MAS that is enhanced by gen AI represents a sophisticated and transformative paradigm in AI, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate or interact within a shared environment to achieve complex goals. These systems are built to harness the synergy of diverse agent capabilities by leveraging the powerful reasoning, creativity, and contextual",
