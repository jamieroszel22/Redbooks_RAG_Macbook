  "content": "Handling outliers: \u2013 Detection: Outliers are identified by using methods like Z-scores, Interquartile Range (IQR), or visualization techniques like boxplots. \u2013 Treatment: Once detected, outliers can be managed by removal, transformation (for example, log transformation), or capping values based on acceptable thresholds. \u2013 Contextual consideration: Not all outliers are problematic; they might represent genuine data points. Understanding their impact is crucial before deciding on a course of action. \u0002 Addressing bias: \u2013 Data auditing: Systematic review of datasets to identify sources of bias, such as underrepresentation of specific groups. \u2013 Data balancing: Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic data (for example, SMOTE) can help balance datasets. 36 Simplify Your AI Journey: Unleashing the Power of AI with IBM watsonx.ai \u2013 Algorithmic bias mitigation: Algorithms can be fine-tuned by using fairness constraints or reweighting schemes to minimize bias during",
