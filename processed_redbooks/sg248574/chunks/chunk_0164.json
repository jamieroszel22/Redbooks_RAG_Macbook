Once the synthetic data is generated, the model is trained by using the InstructLab training framework. This training can be done on a local machine or in a cloud environment, with the flexibility to use GPUs to accelerate the process. 5. After training is complete, the model undergoes a testing phase to ensure that it performs as expected. InstructLab enables users to run tests that evaluate how well the model answers questions and generates responses, which help identify areas for further improvement. 6. The final stage is deploying the trained model, which can be done through the InstructLab serving tools. Once the model is deployed, users can interact with it through the CLI or through an application interface, which enables them to assess how well it",
