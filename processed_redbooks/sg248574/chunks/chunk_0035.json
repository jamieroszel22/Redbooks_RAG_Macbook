The training process involves feeding labeled (supervised learning) or unlabeled (unsupervised learning) data to the algorithm. Over time, the system refines its parameters to minimize errors and maximize predictive accuracy. ML algorithms are central to AI's practical applications, and they drive everything from recommendation systems to fraud detection in modern business ecosystems. \u0002 Deep learning (DL): DL is an advanced branch of ML that employs artificial neural networks that are modeled after the human brain's structure and functioning. Unlike traditional ML, which often depends on manual feature engineering, DL automates the extraction of complex features from raw data through multiple layers of interconnected neurons. DL excels in handling unstructured data such as images, audio, and text, making it instrumental in solving tasks like computer vision, speech recognition, and language translation. For example,",
