  "content": "which enable the model to draw relevant information and learn domain-specific knowledge. For example, watsonx.ai supports both general-purpose and highly specialized model architectures, which facilitate the design of task-optimized LLMs that serve nuanced business needs while ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance. Its multi-modal capabilities enable seamless handling of diverse data types (such as text, image, and audio inputs) and applications to traverse disparate data landscapes cohesively, which achieves a high level of contextual relevance and adaptability. The watsonx.ai platform has several capabilities to support advanced use cases such as prompt engineering, multi-task prompt tuning, and fine-tuning.
