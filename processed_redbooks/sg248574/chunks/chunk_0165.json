Figure 5-9 High-level overview of the InstructLab pipeline 5.4.1 Advantages of InstructLab The InstructLab methodology provides numerous advantages over traditional fine-tuning techniques: \u0002 Synthetic data generation (SDG): Facing and solving an older problem of data availability, InstructLab offers within its automatic capabilities a process to enhance, in cardinality and variability, a training dataset for LLM fine-tuning by using SDG, which is integrated into its core. \u0002 Cost and complexity reduction: One of the most significant benefits of InstructLab is its ability to drastically reduce the cost and complexity of fine-tuning. By relying on SDG rather than manually labeled datasets, InstructLab eliminates one of the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of model customization. \u0002 Agile development: The iterative feedback loops and the ability to work",
