{
  "content": "(required). \u0002 task_description: A description of the skill (required). \u0002 created_by: The GitHub username of the contributor (required). \u0002 seed_examples: A collection of key-value entries with at least five examples (required for new files, although older files may contain fewer examples). \u0002 context: Provides relevant information for grounded skills, which guide the model\u2019s processing (not used for ungrounded skills). \u0002 question: The model's input query (required). \u0002 answer: The expected response (required). The taxonomy tree also categorizes skills as either grounded (requiring context) or ungrounded (not requiring context). For example, a grounded skill might be grounded/linguistics/grammar, while an ungrounded skill might be linguistics/writing/poetry/haiku. The qna.yaml file is always in the final node of the taxonomy path. Importantly, there is a limit on the content length in question-answer pairs to ensure model compatibility; contributions should not exceed approximately 2,300",
