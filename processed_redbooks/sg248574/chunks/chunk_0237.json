  "content": "analysis, this task might be decomposed into tasks like gathering data, analyzing trends, and generating a summary report, with each task that is further divided into specific steps like querying databases or visualizing data. To enable task execution, the system relies on a planner that assigns tasks to the most suitable agents based on their profiles, current workloads, and skillsets. The planner plays a pivotal role in the MAS by orchestrating the decomposition of high-level goals into granular tasks and subtasks. The planning process leverages the agent\u2019s policy and LLM to identify the optimal sequence of actions that are required to achieve the outcome. The planner also monitors progress, adapting task sequences or agent roles as needed to accommodate changing conditions or unexpected challenges. For example, if one agent encounters a bottleneck in data retrieval, the planner can reassign related tasks to another agent with overlapping capabilities. Chapter 6. Artificial",
