  "content": "evaluation outputs a score for both the base model and the newly trained model, along with a report on the improvements or regressions that are observed. For example, you might see that the model improved in one area, like \u201ctonsils,\u201d from a score of 0.74 to 0.78, which indicates that your training enhanced the model\u2019s ability in that particular knowledge domain. MTBench and MTBenchBranch follow a similar structure, but they focus on testing the model\u2019s skills rather than just knowledge. MTBench evaluates the model's ability to perform in multi-turn dialogs, which provide a score for each turn in the conversation, such as turn one and turn two. MTBenchBranch compares your model\u2019s skill performance to a base model, which provides a detailed breakdown of areas where your model improved or regressed, and highlighting any skills that showed no significant change. This detailed feedback helps pinpoint specific areas where more fine-tuning might be necessary to enhance the model's abilities.",
