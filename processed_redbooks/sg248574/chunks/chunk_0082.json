At a high level, they can fall into one of three categories: no-code, low-code, or full-code. \u0002 With no-code tools, users can create solutions and applications without writing code. The tool provides a GUI and includes \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d features so that users can build models with little to no programming knowledge. \u0002 Low-code tools provide a visual approach to development so that users can generate solutions, such as models, with minimal hand-coding. Like no-code tools, these tools typically provide a GUI and include \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d features. Low-code tools enable users with minimal coding experience, such as citizen data scientists or business analysts to quickly build and implement a solution. \u0002 With full-code tools, users can write their own code to develop solutions. These tools are typically leveraged",
