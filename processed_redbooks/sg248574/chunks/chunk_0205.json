  "content": "can be conceptualized as sophisticated orchestrators of intelligence that can address intricate and multi-faceted problems. They achieve these goals by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), formulating detailed plans to resolve challenges, and running these plans by using a diverse set of tools. An agent operates as a cohesive system, and its architecture can typically be broken down into four key modules: \u0002 The agent core \u0002 Search and memory modules \u0002 Planning modules \u0002 Tools Each of these components plays a critical role in ensuring the agent's functions, adaptability, and effectiveness. The agent core stands as the central coordination hub of the agent. It is often described as the \u201cdecision-making nucleus\u201d due to its pivotal role in governing the agent's logic, behavior, and overall strategy. This module is responsible for synthesizing inputs, determining appropriate actions, and managing the interactions between other components. Chapter 6.",
