Policies can be simple, predefined heuristics or sophisticated, dynamically updated models that are informed by machine learning (ML) techniques, such as RL. These policies are operationalized through the agent\u2019s LLM core, which is the generative engine that processes natural language inputs, synthesizes insights, generates context-aware responses, and even creates novel solutions to problems. The LLM also serves as the agent\u2019s interface to interpret ambiguous or unstructured information, which effectively bridges the gap between human language and",
