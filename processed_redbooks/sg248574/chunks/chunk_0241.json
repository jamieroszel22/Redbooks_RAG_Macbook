Human feedback can help decide whether to retry the tool, use an alternative tool, or modify the task parameters. \u0002 Infinite loops: Erroneous task decomposition or planning might result in a loop where the system repeatedly runs the same actions without progress. Human intervention can identify and correct the root cause to prevent resource wastage. \u0002 Rogue paths or wrong tool selection or input: The system might choose an inappropriate tool or misinterpret input data, which can lead to incorrect outputs. Human feedback can help realign the system\u2019s actions to help ensure that the task remains on",
