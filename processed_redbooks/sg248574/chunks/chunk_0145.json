  "content": "across multiple mini-batches, which improve stability at the cost of increased training time. Optimizing this parameter involves selecting an accumulation step size that balances memory efficiency with the effective batch size. Combining this approach with batch size tuning can further optimize resource usage and enhance performance. 5.2.2 Interdependencies and holistic tuning strategies These hyperparameters are interdependent because changes in one can influence the behavior of others. For example, increasing the number of epochs without modifying the learning rate might lead to overfitting, and combining a high batch size with too few epochs might result in undertrained prompts. To navigate these interdependencies, practitioners can employ regularization techniques such as data augmentation to counteract overfitting in high-epoch scenarios. Gradient clipping can also be used to prevent instability during training, particularly when high accumulation steps are involved. Performance",
