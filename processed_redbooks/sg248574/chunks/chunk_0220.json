The modular design of agents, which is supported by a versatile Tool Library, enables scalability and adaptability for a wide range of use cases, and with the usage of agents on watsonx.ai, the scaling to enterprise-grade solutions is once again possible. 94 Simplify Your AI Journey: Unleashing the Power of AI with IBM watsonx.ai 6.2 Why AI agents are needed The necessity for AI agents stems from the growing complexity of tasks and environments that surpass the capabilities of conventional software systems. Traditional systems often falter in scenarios requiring adaptive, context-aware decision-making, especially when dealing with vast datasets, uncertain outcomes, and real-time constraints. In domains like logistics, healthcare, and finance, where decision-making must balance multiple variables simultaneously, the utility of AI agents becomes evident. These agents excel in scenarios demanding real-time responses, such as",
