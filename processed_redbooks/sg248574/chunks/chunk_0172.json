The foundation of using InstructLab effectively is access to its models. The ilab CLI simplifies this process by offering robust integration with repositories like Hugging Face or OCI. It provides authentication mechanisms, such as token-based access for Hugging Face, and features like repository specification and download acceleration. These capabilities help ensure secure and efficient downloads of pre-trained models. To quickly get started, download compact pre-trained versions of the following models: \u0002 granite-7b-lab-GGUF \u0002 merlinite-7b-lab-GGUF \u0002 Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF To initiate the download of",
