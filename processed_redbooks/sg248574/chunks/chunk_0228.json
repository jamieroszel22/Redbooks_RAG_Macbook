Unlike centralized systems where a single entity controls decision-making and system-wide operations, MASs are designed to operate without a single point of failure. If one agent fails or is compromised, the rest of the system can continue to function, which makes it highly resilient. This decentralized approach also allows MASs to scale efficiently because more agents can be added to the system without disrupting its overall performance. Furthermore, because the agents are distributed, they can operate in diverse environments, which include real-time scenarios, where traditional centralized systems might struggle. The power of a MAS lies in this collective intelligence, where the sum of the parts is greater than the individual agents' abilities. As MASs continue to evolve, they are poised to unlock solutions for some of the most",
