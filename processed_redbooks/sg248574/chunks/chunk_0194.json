Figure 5-13 Progress map during the tuning phase of InstructLab on watsonx.ai Before commencing the SDG and fine-tuning process, conduct a peer review of the submitted skills and knowledge files. This review involves project members and SMEs to help ensure comprehensive assessment and validation. If any modifications are identified as necessary during this review phase, new branches can be created within the version control system to incorporate these changes without disrupting the main development line. After you incorporate the feedback and necessary adjustments, the fine-tuning process commences. This step involves leveraging pre-trained models and adjusting them to specific requirements by training on customized datasets. The goal is to enhance the model's performance in targeted areas to help ensure that it",
