Advanced capabilities of watsonx.ai watsonx.ai embodies IBM\u2019s extensive expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models (FMs), which combine advanced AI research with practical tools to make large language models (LLMs) efficient and versatile across many applications. Underlying watsonx.ai is its integration of FMs that are tuned to accelerate and optimize business operations. These models are positioned to perform at the intersection of language understanding, structured data processing, and knowledge retrieval, which enhance the ability to extract, refine, and use vast amounts of unstructured data. The platform's capabilities extend beyond simple text processing to include complex interactions between structured and unstructured data sources,",
