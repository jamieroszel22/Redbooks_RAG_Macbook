Each component in Figure 6-10 plays a critical role in orchestrating complex interactions between users, agents, tools, and workflows, which create a robust and adaptable ecosystem for AI-powered operations. At the top of the architecture is the Unified Assistant, which serves as the single, user-facing interface. This layer is designed to provide a consistent and coherent interaction experience by simplifying user engagement and abstracting the complexities of the underlying system. The Unified Assistant is supported by the Supervisory AI Meta-Agent, which is a central coordinator that facilitates all workflows and helps ensure that user requests are processed accurately and efficiently.
