Hybrid patterns, such as shared message pools or global workspaces, enable agents to post intermediate results or discoveries to a common repository, which enables asynchronous collaboration and emergent problem-solving. The blackboard pattern or global workspace serves as a central knowledge-sharing hub within the MAS. Agents use this shared repository to post updates, intermediate calculations, or unresolved queries, which create a collaborative environment where other agents can contribute insights or take over pending tasks. For example, an agent working on a data analysis task might upload partial results to the blackboard, which another agent can use to generate visualizations or summaries. The MAS is supported by an agents and",
