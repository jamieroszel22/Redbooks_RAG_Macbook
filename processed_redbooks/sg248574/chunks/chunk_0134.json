The additional examples provide a richer context and help the model better understand complex patterns or subtle variations in the task. Few-shot prompting is useful for tasks that require multi-step reasoning, handling of ambiguous inputs, or understanding domain-specific jargon. However, it demands careful prompt construction to balance informativeness and brevity because excessive length can lead to token limitations or diminished performance. Figure 5-1 LLM prompting method types overview 5.1.2 Importance of system tokens In addition to zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques, system tokens (also known as system-level instructions or control tokens) play a critical role in crafting effective prompts. These tokens provide metadata or guidance to steer the behavior of the language model at a higher level, often defining the context, tone, or expected behavior",
