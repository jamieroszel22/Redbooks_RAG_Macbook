  "content": "of agent interactions in a way that enhances the capabilities of individual agents. These frameworks typically feature highly capable, customizable, and conversational agents, which can collaborate through automated agent chats, which improve their collective ability to handle complex tasks. This integration enables MASs to function more efficiently by leveraging the power of language models, tools, and human expertise in a coordinated manner. As a result, MAS frameworks offer an exciting potential for creating more intelligent and adaptive systems that can address a wide range of challenges in both industrial and research contexts. The ongoing evolution of MASs promises to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous systems by enabling new capabilities and driving innovation across various industries. As researchers continue to explore the potential of these systems, new frameworks, coordination strategies, and interaction protocols continue to emerge, further enhancing the",
