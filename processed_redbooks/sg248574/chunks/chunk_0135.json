  "content": "of the model during inference. Importantly, the implementation and interpretation of these tokens can vary across different models, making their effective use model specific. System tokens enable users to establish a \u201crole\u201d or context for the model, shaping its responses beyond what is specified in the natural language prompt. By embedding these tokens, users can accomplish the following goals: \u0002 Control output behavior: Ensure the order of prompt completions between the main prompt areas of System, Assistant, and User \u0002 Reduce ambiguity: Guide the model's interpretation of the task, especially in contexts where instructions alone might be misinterpreted. \u0002 Enhance few-shot learning: When combined with example-based prompting, system tokens can provide an overarching framework that amplifies the impact of the examples. 5.1.3 Model-specific peculiarities Different language models interpret and use system tokens in unique ways due to their architecture and pre-training data.
