High-quality data helps ensure that AI systems deliver consistent and accurate outputs, which foster stakeholder trust and facilitate broader adoption. For example, explainable AI (XAI) models rely on trusted data to generate transparent and interpretable insights, which address concerns about the \u201cblack-box\u201d nature of AI. Also, trusted data simplifies model auditing and debugging by enabling the identification of inconsistencies and anomalies, which leads to continuous performance improvements. By prioritizing data quality, organizations can overcome one of the primary challenges of scaling AI systems. Chapter 1. Competing with artificial",
