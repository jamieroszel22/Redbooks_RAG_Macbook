Synthetic Data Generator The Synthetic Data Generator is a no-code tool that you can use to generate tabular data for model training. Users have two options to generate synthetic data by using the graphical flow editor in the Synthetic Data Generator tool: \u0002 Generate synthetic tabular data based on production data, with the goal of masking and mimicking this data. \u0002 Generate synthetic data from a custom data schema that is defined by the user by using visual flows and modeling algorithms.
