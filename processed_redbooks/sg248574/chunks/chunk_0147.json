This process is beneficial for industries that require high precision in terminology and context, such as healthcare, finance, and legal services. Fine-tuning within the watsonx.ai ecosystem exemplifies a sophisticated approach to model specialization, which enables foundation LLMs to adapt to domain-specific needs through retraining. Unlike prompt tuning, which focuses on lightweight modifications to steer model behavior, fine-tuning directly alters the model\u2019s weights to encode new knowledge or align with complex industry-specific language structures and terminologies. 5.3.1 Challenges with fine-tuning To fully appreciate the significance of watsonx.ai capabilities, it is essential to understand the inherent complexity of fine-tuning in general. At its core, fine-tuning involves retraining a model\u2019s internal weights on carefully curated",
