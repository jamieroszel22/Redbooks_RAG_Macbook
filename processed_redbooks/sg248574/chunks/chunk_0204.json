  "content": "its ability to reason and decide, which is driven by algorithms that enable it to analyze inputs, predict outcomes, and choose actions that are aligned with specific objectives. Unlike traditional software systems, which operate on predefined instructions, AI agents exhibit autonomy and flexibility with dynamic execution flows, which enable them to handle complex scenarios with minimal human intervention. This autonomy stems from their design principles, which often draw from cognitive sciences, game theory, and control systems, enabling agents to emulate human-like decision-making processes. Furthermore, each AI agent can be designed for different levels of complexity and interaction. This adaptability makes AI agents indispensable in fields such as robotics and natural language processing (NLP), where complex interactions with dynamic environments are required. Figure 6-1 shows a schematic view of an AI agent. Figure 6-1 Schematic view of an AI agent Agents, in the context of AI,",
