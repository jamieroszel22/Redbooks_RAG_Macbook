  "content": "mitigation of these threats can be challenging and require expertise and resources. Furthermore, the integration of AI models with existing security systems and processes can be complex, which can lead to issues with compatibility and performance. 1.2.1 Technical considerations for building and deploying AI models When building and deploying AI models, there are several technical considerations that must be accounted for: \u0002 Data preprocessing: Ensuring that the data that is used to train and test the model is accurate, complete, and relevant. \u0002 Model selection: Choosing the most suitable algorithm and model architecture for the problem being addressed. \u0002 Hyper-parameter tuning: Optimizing the model's hyper-parameters to achieve the best possible performance. \u0002 Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance by using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. \u0002 Model deployment: Deploying the model in a production-ready environment, such as a cloud-based API or a",
