  "content": "convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specialize in image processing by identifying spatial hierarchies in pixels, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers tackle sequential data with unparalleled efficiency. By leveraging high-performance computing and large datasets, DL approximates nonlinear functions to enable machines to solve intricate, high-dimensional problems. \u0002 Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning focuses on deriving patterns and structures from unlabeled datasets. This method trains algorithms to identify inherent groupings, clusters, or associations in data without human-provided annotations. Common techniques include clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE. Applications of unsupervised learning are vast, ranging from customer segmentation in marketing to anomaly detection in cybersecurity. These systems are particularly valuable in",
