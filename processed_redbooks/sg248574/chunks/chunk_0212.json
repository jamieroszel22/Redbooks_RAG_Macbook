  "content": "instant messaging platforms can be integrated to address domain-specific needs. The versatility and effectiveness of an agent are enhanced by its ability to leverage these specialized tools. Going one step forward, agents that rely solely on text inputs face inherent limitations in their ability to interact with and analyze diverse data formats. Multi-modal agents address this limitation by incorporating the ability to process and reason over various input types, which include images, audio files, and structured datasets. This capability expands the range of applications for agents, which enable them to tackle tasks that require visual analysis, speech processing, or combined reasoning across multiple modalities. For example, a multi-modal agent can analyze an image to extract relevant features, process an accompanying audio file for contextual information, and synthesize this data with text-based inputs to deliver a comprehensive solution.
