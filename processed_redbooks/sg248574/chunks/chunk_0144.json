  "content": "overshooting optimal solutions, and can lead to suboptimal performance or even divergence. Conversely, a low learning rate enables a more precise exploration of the parameter space, which increases the likelihood of finding an optimal solution at the cost of prolonged training. Effective strategies include employing learning rate schedules, such as cosine decay or step-based decay, which adjust the learning rate dynamically during training. Warm-up strategies, where the learning rate gradually increases at the start of training, can also mitigate initial instability and improve overall training robustness. \u0002 The concept of accumulation steps addresses memory constraints by enabling gradient accumulation across several mini-batches before updating the model\u2019s parameters. This approach effectively simulates larger batch sizes without exceeding hardware memory limits, which make it valuable for memory-constrained environments. Accumulation steps smooth gradient updates by averaging",
