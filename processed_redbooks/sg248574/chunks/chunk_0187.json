Chapter 5. Advanced capabilities of watsonx.ai 79 For each benchmark, the evaluation generates detailed reports, which show scores and identify areas where the model performs well and areas that need further work. For example, the MMLU report provides a score for various subjects, such as abstract algebra, anatomy, and business ethics, which indicate how the model performs in each area. A typical output for MMLU looks like a series of subject categories with a score 0.0 - 1.0, with higher scores indicating better performance in the respective topics. Running MMLUBranch involves evaluating your model's contributions compared to a base model. The",
