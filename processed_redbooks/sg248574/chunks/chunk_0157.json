Figure 5-6 The InstructLab large language model development kit functions overview The InstructLab approach to fine-tuning is heavily grounded in the concept of taxonomy-driven knowledge curation. Taxonomies, in this context, are structured frameworks of concepts and relationships that organize information into logical categories and subcategories. These taxonomies are built collaboratively by SMEs, and they serve as the foundation for the knowledge that is used to tune the model. For example, if a business wanted to fine-tune an LLM on customer support for a specific industry, an SME in that industry would work with a taxonomy that represents common questions, issues, and terminology that are relevant to the field. By formalizing domain knowledge in a taxonomy, InstructLab helps ensure that the model fine-tuning process is precise, efficient, and contextually relevant.",
