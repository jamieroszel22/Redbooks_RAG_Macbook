Online deployment is ideal for real-time processing, where the model handles input data and provides immediate predictions. Batch deployment is suitable for processing large datasets in bulk, which generate predictions for a collection of inputs at scheduled intervals or on-demand. 44 Simplify Your AI Journey: Unleashing the Power of AI with IBM watsonx.ai 4. Test the deployment: After deployment, validate the model\u2019s functions by going to the newly created deployment and clicking regression_model_deployment, as shown in Figure 4-31. Figure 4-31 Deployment overview watsonx.ai Studio provides multiple ways to test the deployment, such as the Test tab and code snippets (Figure 4-32). Figure 4-32 Deployment testing Chapter 4. Building and using artificial intelligence models 45 By following these steps, you can effectively deploy and manage your AI models within watsonx.ai Studio,",
