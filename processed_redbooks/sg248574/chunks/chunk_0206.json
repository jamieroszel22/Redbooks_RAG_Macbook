These goals act as the guiding principles that dictate the agent\u2019s actions and responses, which help ensure that its operations align with the overarching objectives that it is designed to achieve. Without clear goals, the agent risks becoming unfocused or inefficient. \u0002 Another critical aspect of the agent core is the explicit definition of the tools that are available for execution, which involves creating a comprehensive \u201cuser manual\u201d that counts and describes all tools at the agent's disposal. Each tool\u2019s capabilities, limitations, and specific use cases should be outlined to enable the agent to allocate resources effectively and run tasks with precision. \u0002 Furthermore, the agent core must provide detailed guidance about the utilization of planning",
