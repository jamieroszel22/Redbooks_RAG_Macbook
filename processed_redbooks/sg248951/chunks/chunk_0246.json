  "content": "compared to TLB1-miss. The new translation engine allows up to four translations pending concurrently. Each translation step is ~2x faster, which helps second level guests. 3.4.13 Instruction fetching, decoding, and grouping The superscalar design of the microprocessor allows for the decoding of up to six instructions per cycle and the execution of up to 12 instructions per cycle. Both execution and storage accesses for instruction and operand fetching can occur out of sequence. Instruction fetching Instruction fetching normally tries to get as far ahead of instruction decoding and execution as possible because of the relatively large instruction buffers that are available. In the microprocessor, smaller instruction buffers are used. The operation code is fetched from the I-cache and put in instruction buffers that hold prefetched data that is awaiting decoding. Instruction decoding The processor can decode up to six instructions per cycle. The result of the decoding process is queued",
