As discussed in 3.5.9, \u201cProcessor unit assignment\u201d on page 110, and under \u201cMemory allocation\u201d on page 113, PR/SM memory and logical processor allocation goal is to place all logical partition resources on a single CPC drawer, if possible. There can be negative impacts on a logical partition\u2019s performance when CPs are allocated in different drawers. IBM zPCR implements a warning notice when logical partition\u2019s number of Logical CPs defined is larger than the number of Real CPs in a single drawer. When that scenario occurs, it is advisable to contact IBM to review your configuration.
