  "content": "These PUs are dispatched to online logical PUs. For example, consider an IBM z16 with 10 CPs, 2 IFLs, 5 zIIPs, and 1 ICF. This system has a PU pool of 18 PUs, called the pool width. Subdivision defines the following pools: \u0002 A CP pool of 10 CPs \u0002 An ICF pool of one ICF \u0002 An IFL pool of two IFLs \u0002 A zIIP pool of five zIIPs PUs are placed in the pools in the following circumstances: \u0002 When the system is PORed \u0002 At the time of a concurrent upgrade \u0002 As a result of adding PUs during a CBU \u0002 Following a capacity on-demand upgrade through On/Off CoD or CIU. PUs are removed from their pools when a concurrent downgrade occurs as the result of the removal of a CBU. They also are removed through the On/Off CoD process and the conversion of a PU. When a dedicated LPAR is activated, its PUs are taken from the correct pools. This process also is the case when an LPAR logically configures a PU as on, if the width of the pool allows for it. For an LPAR, logical PUs are dispatched from the supporting",
