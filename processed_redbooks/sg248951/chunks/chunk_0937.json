These IBM z16 features need enough spare capacity so that they can cover the resources of a fenced or isolated drawer. This configuration imposes limits on the following number of the client-owned PUs that can be activated when one drawer within a model is fenced: \u0002 A maximum of: \u2013 39 PUs are configured on the Max39 \u2013 82 PUs are configured on the Max82 \u2013 125 PUs are configured on the Max125 \u2013 168 PUs are configured on the Max168 \u2013 200 PUs are configured on the Max200 Chapter 9.
