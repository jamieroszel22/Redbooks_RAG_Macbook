Table 4-9 RoCE Express features summary 4.6.4 Parallel Sysplex connectivity Coupling links are required in a Parallel Sysplex configuration to provide connectivity from the z/OS images to the coupling facility (CF). A properly configured Parallel Sysplex provides a highly reliable, redundant, and robust IBM Z technology solution to achieve near-continuous availability. A Parallel Sysplex is composed of one or more z/OS operating system images that are coupled through one or more CFs. This section describes coupling link features supported in a Parallel Sysplex in which an IBM z16 can participate. Coupling links The type of coupling link that is used to connect a CF to an operating system LPAR is important. The link performance significantly affects response times and coupling processor usage. For configurations that",
