  "content": "until Workload Manager (WLM) determines that the zIIPs are overcommitted. WLM then requests help from the CPs. When help is requested, the CPs consider dispatching zIIP-eligible work on the CPs based on the dispatching priority relative to other workloads. When the zIIP engines are no longer overcommitted, the CPs stop considering zIIP-eligible work for dispatch. This option runs as much zIIP-eligible work on zIIPs as possible. It also allows it to spill over onto the CPs only when the zIIPs are overcommitted. \u0002 Option 2: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=NO) zIIP-eligible work runs on zIIPs only while at least one zIIP engine is online. zIIP-eligible work is not normally dispatched on a CP, even if the zIIPs are overcommitted and CPs are unused. The exception is that zIIP-eligible work can sometimes run on a CP to resolve resource conflicts. Therefore, zIIP-eligible work does not affect the CP utilization that is used for reporting through the subcapacity reporting tool",
