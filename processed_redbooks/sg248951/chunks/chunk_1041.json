The HMC/SE interface provides the following capabilities: \u0002 Defining the cryptographic controls \u0002 Dynamically adding a Crypto feature to a partition: \u2013 For the first time \u2013 That already uses Crypto \u0002 Dynamically removing a Crypto feature from a partition The Crypto Express8S, which is a new Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cryptographic coprocessor, is an optional IBM z16 exclusive feature. Crypto Express8S provides a secure programming and hardware environment on which crypto processes are run. Each Crypto Express8S adapter can be configured by the installation as a Secure IBM CCA coprocessor, a Secure IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 (EP11) coprocessor, or an accelerator. When EP11 mode is selected, a unique Enterprise PKCS #11 firmware is loaded into the cryptographic",
