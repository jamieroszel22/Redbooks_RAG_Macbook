  "content": "correctly display CX4 cards in the PCIe Activity reports. Support in select Linux on IBM Z distributions is now provided for Shared Memory Communications over Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R) by using the supported RoCE Express features. For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page. The RoCE Express3 features also can provide LAN connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. The 10 GbE RoCE Express2 feature also is used by Linux on IBM Z for applications that are coded to the native RoCE verb interface or use Ethernet (such as TCP/IP). This native use does not require a peer OSA. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. Shared Memory Communication - Direct Memory Access First",
