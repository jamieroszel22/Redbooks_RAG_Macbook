The configuration of the Crypto Express8S adapter as EP11 coprocessor requires a TKE workstation (FC 0057/0058) with TKE 10.0 (FC 0882) LIC. The same requirement applies to CCA mode for a full PCI-compliant environment. The Crypto Express8S feature does not use CHPIDs from the channel subsystem pool. However, the Crypto Express8S feature requires one slot in a PCIe I/O drawer, and one PCHID for each PCIe cryptographic adapter. For enabling an LPAR to use a Crypto Express8S adapter, the following cryptographic resources in the image profile must be defined for each partition: \u0002 Usage domain index \u0002 Control domain index \u0002 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Candidate List \u0002 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Online List Chapter 6.
