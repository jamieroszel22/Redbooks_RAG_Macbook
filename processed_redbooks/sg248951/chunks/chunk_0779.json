For more information about the ARCHITECTURE, TUNE, and VECTOR compiler options, see z/OS XL C/C++ User\u2019s Guide, SC14-7307-40. z/OS XL C/C++ Web deliverables are available at no charge to z/OS XL C/C++ customers: \u0002 Based on open-source LLVM infrastructure; supports up to date C++ language standards \u0002 64-bit, UNIX System Services only Note: IBM z16 does not support InfiniBand coupling links. More planning might be required to integrate the IBM z16 in a Parallel Sysplex with IBM IBM z14servers. Important: Use the previous IBM Z ARCHITECTURE or TUNE options for C/C++ programs if the same applications run on the previous IBM Z servers. However, if C/C++ applications run on IBM z16 servers only, use the latest ARCHITECTURE and TUNE options to ensure that the best performance possible is delivered through the latest instruction set additions.",
