The HMC communicates with the SE is through a customer-supplied Ethernet switch (two switches are recommended for redundancy). Each SE and each HMC has two Ethernet RJ45 ports. An example of these connections are made without an HMA is shown in Figure 10-18. Chapter 10. Hardware Management Console and Support Element 425 Figure 10-18 HMC / SE connectivity without HMA The connectivity for multiple CPC generations and mixing stand-alone HMCs and HMAs environments (IBM z16 N-2 only) is shown in Figure 10-19. Figure 10-19 IBM z16 HMC/SE connectivity with multiple CPCs Various methods are available for setting up the network. Designing and planning the HMC and SE connectivity is the customers\u2019 responsibility, based on the environment\u2019s connectivity and security requirements. Note: The HMC must be connected to the SEs by using a customer-provided switch. Direct connection between the HMC and the SEs is",
