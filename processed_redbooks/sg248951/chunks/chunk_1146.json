  "content": "the extra capacity activated: \u0002 Improved and more predictable response times with lower latency (especially when compared to a public cloud solution) \u0002 Faster transaction processing, with shorter spikes of high use \u0002 Higher number of active processor engines have a positive n-way effect (higher parallelization) and delivers more cache, less contention, and overhead \u0002 Optimized workload handling under customer-defined use thresholds \u0002 Improved insight for future capacity planning \u0002 Improved balance between physical and logical Central Processor (CPs) \u0002 Reduced Processor Resource/System Manager (PR/SM) logical partitions (LPAR) management, less overhead Conclusion The combination of TFP for the hardware and software is a powerful one for our customers to maximize their investment in IBM Z. For eligible customers, it allows them to use their hardware for their general capacity requirements with a consumption-based corridor on top. When this TFP for hardware is combined with the TFP-SW",
