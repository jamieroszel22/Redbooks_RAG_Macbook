VFM also can be used by coupling facility images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures. VFM can help organizations meet their most demanding service level agreements and compete more effectively. VFM is easy to configure in the LPAR Image Profile and provides rapid time to value. 4 CPC 1 and CPC 2 can be added concurrently in the field if FC 2981 and FC 2982 are ordered with the initial configuration.
