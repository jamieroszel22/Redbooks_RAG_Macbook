This specialized hardware performs AES, DES and TDES, RSA, Elliptic Curve (ECC), SHA-1, and SHA-2, and other cryptographic operations. It supports specialized high-level cryptographic APIs and functions, including those functions that are required with quantum-safe cryptography and in the banking industry. Crypto-Express8S features are designed to meet the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 4 and PCI HSM security requirements for hardware security modules. IBM z16 is the industry\u2019s first quantum-safe system5. Consider the following points: \u0002 IBM z16 quantum-safe secure boot technology helps to protect IBM Z firmware from quantum attacks by using a",
