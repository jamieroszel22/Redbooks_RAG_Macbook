Great flexibility and interoperability are available for training and building models. Figure 3-16 Software ecosystem for the AI accelerator Acknowledging the diverse AI training frameworks, customers can train their models on platforms of their choice, including IBM Z (on-premises and in hybrid cloud) and then, deploy it efficiently on IBM Z in colocation with the transactional workloads. No other development effort is needed to enable this strategy. IBM has invested into Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), which is a standard format for representing AI models that allows a data scientist to build and train a model in the framework of choice without worrying about the downstream inference implications. To enable deployment of ONNX models, IBM provides an",
