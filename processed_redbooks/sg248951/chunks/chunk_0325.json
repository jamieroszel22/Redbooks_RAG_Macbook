  "content": "design 127 3.7.4 Logical partition storage granularity Granularity of main storage for an LPAR depends on the largest main storage amount that is defined for initial or reserved main storage, as listed in Table 3-816. Table 3-8 Logical partition main storage granularity (IBM z16) LPAR storage granularity information is required for LPAR image setup and for z/OS RSU definition. On IBM z16 A01, LPARs are limited to a maximum of 16 TB of main storage. However, the maximum amount of memory that is supported by z/OS V2R2, V2R3, and V2R4 is 4 TB. z/OS V2R5 supports up to 16 TB. For z/VM V7R1 the limit is 2 TB, and z/VM V7R2 increases the limit to 4 TB. 3.7.5 LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration Dynamic storage reconfiguration on IBM z16 systems allows an operating system that is running on an LPAR to add (nondisruptively) its reserved storage amount to its configuration. This process can occur only if unused storage exists. This unused storage can be obtained when another LPAR releases",
