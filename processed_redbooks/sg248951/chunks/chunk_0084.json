FICON Express32S features are implemented by using PCIe cards, and offer better port granularity and improved capabilities over the previous FICON Express features. FICON Express32S features support a link data rate of 32 gigabytes per second (Gbps) (8, 16, or 32 Gbps auto-negotiate), and it is the preferred technology for new systems. zHyperLink Express zHyperLink was created to provide fast access to data by way of low-latency connections between the IBM Z platform and storage. The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature allows you to make synchronous requests for data that is in the storage cache of the IBM DS8900F. This process is done by directly connecting the zHyperLink Express1.1 port in the IBM z16 to an I/O Bay port of the IBM DS8000. This short distance (up to 150 m [492 feet), direct connection is designed for low-latency reads and writes, such as with IBM DB2\u00ae for z/OS synchronous I/O reads and log writes.
