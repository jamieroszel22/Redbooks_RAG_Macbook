  "content": "capacity. For example, the application in question might be running through several service class periods, where the first period is the important one. The application might be defined as importance level 2 or 3, but might depend on other work that is running with importance level 1. Therefore, it is important to consider which workloads to control and which service class periods to specify. Remember: CPM controls capacity tokens for the On/Off CoD records. In a situation where a capacity token is used, the system deactivates the corresponding offering record. Therefore, you must prepare routines for catching the warning messages about capacity tokens being used, and have administrative procedures in place for such a situation. The messages from the system begin five days before a capacity token is fully used. To avoid capacity records being deactivated in this situation, replenish the necessary capacity tokens before they are used. 364 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 8.8 System",
