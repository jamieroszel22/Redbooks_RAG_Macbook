It provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z platform intra-communications. Shared Memory Communications-Direct Memory Access (SMC-D) uses ISM. SMC-D optimizes operating systems communications in a way that is transparent to socket applications. It also reduces the CPU cost of TCP/IP processing in the data path, which enables highly efficient and application-transparent communications. SMC-D requires no extra physical resources (such as RoCE Express features, PCIe bandwidth, ports, I/O slots, network resources, or Ethernet switches). Instead, SMC-D uses LPAR-to-LPAR",
