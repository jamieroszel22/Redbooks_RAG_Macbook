The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express7S and OSA-Express6S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity. Each adapter can be configured in the following modes: \u0002 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD \u0002 Non-QDIO, with CHPID type OSE \u0002 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC Note: Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature. Removal of support for OSA-Express 1000BASE-T hardware adaptersa: IBM z16 is planned to be the last IBM Z server to support OSA-Express 1000BASE-T hardware adapters (FC 0426, 0446, and 0458) on new build servers. Defining all valid OSA CHPID types is allowed on OSA-Express GbE adapters only. IBM plans to continue moving forward with OSA CHPID types on higher bandwidth fiber Ethernet adapters on future servers. a. Statements by IBM regarding its plans,",
