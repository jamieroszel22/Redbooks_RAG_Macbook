  "content": "DCMs) and the PCIe+ I/O drawers are air cooled by redundant fans. Airflow of the system is directed from front (cool air) to the back of the system (hot air). Radiator-cooled (air-cooled) models (FC 4040, FC 4041) The IBM z16 A01 PU DCMs in the CPC drawers are cooled by closed loop water. The internal closed water loop removes heat from PU DCMs by circulating water between the radiator heat exchanger and the cold plate that is mounted on the PU DCMs. For more information, see 2.9.5, \u201cRadiator Cooling Unit\u201d on page 64. Although the PU DCMs are cooled by water, the heat is exhausted into the room from the radiator heat exchanger by forced air with blowers. At the system level, these IBM z16 A01 are still air-cooled systems. Note: Customer power sources should always maintain redundancy across BPA pairs; that is, one power source or distribution panel supplies power for BPA1 and the separate power source or distribution panel supplies power for BPA2. As a best practice, connect the",
