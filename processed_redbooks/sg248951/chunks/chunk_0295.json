  "content": "to benefit from large pages. Long-running work with low memory-access frequency is less likely to maintain its entries in the TLB. However, when it does run, few address translations are required to resolve all of the memory it needs. Therefore, a long-running process can benefit even without frequent memory access. Weigh the benefits of whether something in this category must use large pages as a result of the system-level costs of tying up real storage. A balance exists between the performance of a process that uses large pages and the performance of the remaining work on the system. On IBM z16 server, 1 MB large pages become pageable if Virtual Flash Memory14 is available and enabled. They are available only for 64-bit virtual private storage, such as virtual memory that is above 2 GB. It is easy to assume that increasing the TLB size is a feasible option to deal with TLB-miss situations. However, this process is not as simple as it seems. As the size of the TLB increases, so does",
