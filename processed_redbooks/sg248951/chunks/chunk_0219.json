  "content": "instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for a better cycles per instruction (CPI) design. \u0002 Maximized performance per watt. \u0002 Enhanced instruction dispatch and grouping efficiency. \u0002 Increased Out-of-Order) resources, such as Global Completion Table entries, physical GPR entries, and physical FPR entries. \u0002 Improved completion rate. \u0002 Reduced cache/TLB miss penalty. \u0002 Improved execution of D-Cache store and reload and new Fixed-point divide. \u0002 New Operand Store Compare (OSC) (load-hit-store conflict) avoidance scheme. \u0002 Enhanced branch prediction structure and sequential instruction fetching. Program results The Out-of-Order execution does not change any program results. Execution can occur out of (program) order, but all program dependencies are accepted, and the same results are seen as in-order (program) execution. The design was optimized by increasing the Global Completion Table (GCT) from 48x3 to 60x3, which increased the issue queue size from 2x30 to 2x36 and designed a new Mapper.",
