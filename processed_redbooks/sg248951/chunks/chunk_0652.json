  "content": "application, SMT is transparent and no changes are required in the application for it to run in an SMT environment, as shown in Figure 7-1. Figure 7-1 Simultaneous multithreading z/OS The use of SMT on z/OS requires enabling HiperDispatch, and defining the processor view (PROCVIEW) control statement in the LOADxx parmlib member and the MT_ZIIP_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx parmlib member. The PROCVIEW statement is defined for the life of IPL, and can have the following values: \u0002 CORE: This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core, in which a core can include one or more threads. The number of threads is limited by IBM z16 to two threads. If the underlying hardware does not support SMT, a core is limited to one thread. \u0002 CPU: This value is the default. It specifies that z/OS should configure a traditional processor view of CPU and not use SMT. \u0002 CORE,CPU_OK: This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core (as with the CORE value) but",
