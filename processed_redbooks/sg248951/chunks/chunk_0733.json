OSA-Express7S Gigabit Ethernet LX and SX (carry forward) IBM z16 introduces an Ethernet technology refresh with OSA-Express7S Gigabit Ethernet features to be installed in the PCIe I/O drawer, which is supported by the 16 GBps PCIe Gen3 host bus. The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express6S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity. Each adapter can be configured in the following modes: \u0002 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD \u0002 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. Note: Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature. 304 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet",
