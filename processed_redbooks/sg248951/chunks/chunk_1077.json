Note: If your software configuration is different from what is described here, the performance results might vary. 1 Traditional online transaction processing workload (formerly known as IMS). 2 Commercial batch with long-running jobs. Chapter 12. Performance and capacity planning 477 The CPU Measurement Facility (CPU MF) data that was introduced on the z10 provides insight into the interaction of workload and hardware design in production workloads. CPU MF data helps LSPR to adjust workload capacity curves that are based on the underlying hardware sensitivities; in particular, the processor access to caches and memory. This processor access to caches and memory is called Relative Nest Intensity (for more information, see 12.4, \u201cRelative Nest Intensity\u201d on page 479). By using this data, LSPR introduces three workload capacity categories that replace all older primitives and mixes. LSPR contains the internal throughput rate ratios (ITRRs) for the IBM z16 and the previous",
