  "content": "lanes), the signaling rate of each lane, and the signal encoding rule. The signaling rate of one PCIe Generation 3 lane is eight gigatransfers per second (GTps), which means that nearly 8 gigabits are transmitted per second (Gbps). A PCIe Gen3 x16 link features the following data transmission rates: \u0002 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per lane: 8 Gbps * 128/130 bit (encoding) = 7.87 Gbps=984.6 MBps \u0002 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per link: 984.6 MBps * 16 (lanes) = 15.75 GBps Note: I/O infrastructure for IBM z16, as for IBM z15, is implemented as PCIe Generation 3. The PU chip PCIe interface is PCIe Generation 4 (x16 @32 GBps), but the CPC I/O fan-out infrastructure provides external connectivity as PCIe Generation 3 @16GBps 148 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Considering that the PCIe link is full-duplex mode, the data throughput rate of a PCIe Gen3 x16 link is 31.5 GBps (15.75 GBps in both directions). PCIe Gen3 x16 links are used in IBM z16 servers for",
