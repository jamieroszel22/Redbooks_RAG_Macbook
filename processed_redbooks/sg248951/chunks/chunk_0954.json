  "content": "concurrent update or upgrade. Consider the following key points about CDM: \u0002 The HMA can query whether a system is ready for a concurrent driver upgrade. \u0002 Previous firmware updates, which require an initial machine load (IML) of the IBM z16 system to be activated, can block the ability to run a concurrent driver upgrade. \u0002 A function on the SE allows you or your IBM SSR to define the concurrent driver upgrade sync point to be used for a CDM. \u0002 The ability to concurrently install and activate a driver can eliminate or reduce a planned outage. \u0002 IBM z16 introduces Concurrent Driver Upgrade (CDU) cloning support to other CPCs for CDU preinstallation and activation. \u0002 Concurrent crossover from Driver level N to Driver level N+1, then to Driver level N+2, must be done serially. No composite moves are allowed. \u0002 Disruptive upgrades are permitted at any time, and allow for a composite upgrade (Driver N to Driver N+2). \u0002 Concurrently backing up to the previous driver level is not possible.",
