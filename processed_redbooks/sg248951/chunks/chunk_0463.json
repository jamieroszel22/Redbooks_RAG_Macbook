Analogous to the Layer 3 functions, HiperSockets Layer 2 devices can be configured as primary or secondary connectors, or multicast routers. This configuration enables the creation of high-performance and high-availability link layer switches between the internal HiperSockets network and an external Ethernet network. It also can be used to connect to the HiperSockets Layer 2 networks of different servers. HiperSockets Layer 2 is supported by Linux on IBM Z, and by z/VM for Linux guest use. IBM z16 supports the HiperSockets Completion Queue function that is designed to allow HiperSockets to transfer data synchronously (if possible) and asynchronously, if necessary. This feature combines ultra-low latency with more tolerance for traffic peaks. With the asynchronous support, data can be temporarily held until the receiver",
