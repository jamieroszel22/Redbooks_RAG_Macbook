Note: CHPID types OSM, OSN, and OSX are not supported on IBM z16. 178 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide The OSA-Express6S 10 GbE LR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only. A 9 \u00b5m single-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting this feature to the selected device. For more information about supported distances, see Table 4-8 on page 179. OSA-Express6S Gigabit Ethernet SX (FC 0423) The OSA-Express6S GbE SX feature includes one PCIe adapter and two ports. The two ports share a channel path identifier (CHPID type OSD). The ports support attachment to a 1 Gbps Ethernet LAN. Each port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express6S GbE SX feature supports the use of an LC",
