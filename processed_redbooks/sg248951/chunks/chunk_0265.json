A zIIP enables eligible z/OS workloads to have a portion of them directed for execution to a processor that is characterized as a zIIP. Because the zIIPs do not increase the MSU value of the processor, they do not affect the IBM software license changes. IBM z16 is the fourth generation of IBM Z processors to support SMT. IBM z16 servers implement two threads per core on IFLs and zIIPs. SMT must be enabled at the LPAR level and supported by the z/OS operating system. SMT was enhanced for IBM z16 and it is enabled for SAPs by default (no customer intervention required). Introduced in z/OS V2R4, the z/OS Container Extensions7 allows deployment of Linux on IBM Z software components, such as Docker Containers in a z/OS system, in direct support of z/OS workloads without requiring a separately",
