Assign the weights and logicals also applies to specialty engines. \u0002 Assign a suitable number of logical CPs. If you assign too many logical CPs to the LPAR, PR/SM may place them at further distances, reducing efficiency and increasing unnecessary LPAR management. This issue reduces the efficiency of the cache. For more information about the number of Logical CPs defined for an LPAR, please refer to this document: Number of Logical",
