CCWs with data chaining can be used to process I/O data blocks that have a more complex internal structure, in which portions of the data block are directed into separate buffer areas. This process is sometimes known as scatter-read or scatter-write. However, as technology evolves and link speed increases, data chaining techniques become less efficient because of switch fabrics, control unit processing and exchanges, and other issues. The MIDAW facility is a method of gathering and scattering data from and into discontinuous storage locations during an I/O operation. The MIDAW format is shown in Figure 7-3. It is 16 bytes long and aligned on a quadword. Figure 7-3 MIDAW format An example of MIDAW usage is shown in Figure 7-4. Figure 7-4 MIDAW usage 292 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide The use of MIDAWs is indicated by the MIDAW bit in the CCW. If this bit is set, the skip flag cannot be set in the CCW. The skip flag in the MIDAW can be used",
