Reliability, availability, and serviceability 393 \u0002 Memory subsystem Redundant Array of Independent Memory (RAIM) on IBM Z servers is a concept that is similar to the concept of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). The RAIM design detects and recovers from dynamic random access memory (DRAM), socket, memory channel, or DIMM failures. Memory size now includes RAIM protection and recovery. Memory channels are organized in 8-card RAIM groups that provide 50% reduced RAIM overhead (compared to IBM z15). RAIM protection is similar to IBM z15: \u2013 Up to three chip marks and one channel mark \u2013 DDR4 DRAM with on chip power regulation \u2013 N+1 voltage regulators Memory is implemented by using Standard Open Memory Interface (OMI) with up to six OMIs per drawer, has CRC/Retry for soft errors, degrade bus lanes 4->2 on hard error, and no waiting for all eight cards (use first seven to respond). A precise marking of faulty chips helps ensure timely DIMM replacements. The",
