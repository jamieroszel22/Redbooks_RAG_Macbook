The cooperation between z/OS and PR/SM is bundled in a function that is called HiperDispatch. HiperDispatch uses the IBM z16 cache topology, which features reduced cross-cluster \u201chelp\u201d and better locality for multi-task address spaces. PR/SM can use dynamic PU reassignment to move processors (CPs, ZIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and spares) to a different chip and drawer to improve the reuse of shared caches by processors of the same partition. It can use dynamic memory relocation (DMR) to move a running partition\u2019s memory to different physical memory to improve the affinity and reduce the distance between the memory of a partition and the processors of the partition. For more information about HiperDispatch, see 3.7, \u201cLogical partitioning\u201d on page 117. 76 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 3.3.2 CPC drawer interconnect topology CPC drawers are interconnected in a point-to-point topology that allows a CPC",
