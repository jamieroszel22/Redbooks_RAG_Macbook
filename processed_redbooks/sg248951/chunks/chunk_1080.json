The following design alternatives affect this component: \u0002 Cycle time (GHz) \u0002 Instruction architecture \u0002 Pipeline \u0002 Superscalar \u0002 Out-of-order execution \u0002 Branch prediction \u0002 Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB) \u0002 Transactional Execution (TX) \u0002 Single instruction multiple data instruction set (SIMD) \u0002 Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT)5 As workloads are moved between microprocessors with various designs, performance varies. However, when on a processor, this component tends to be similar across all models of that processor. 12.3.3 Memory hierarchy and memory nest The memory hierarchy of a processor generally refers to the caches, data buses, and memory arrays that stage the instructions and data that must be run on the microprocessor to complete a transaction or job. The following design choices affect this component: \u0002 Cache",
