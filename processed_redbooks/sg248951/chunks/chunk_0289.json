The resources, such as memory and logical processors, are assigned to the logical partitions at the time of their activation. Later on, when all partitions are activated, PR/SM can move memory between CPC drawers to benefit the performance of each LPAR, without operating system knowledge. This process was done on the previous families of IBM Z servers only for PUs that use PR/SM dynamic PU reallocation. 114 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide With IBM z16 servers, this process occurs whenever the configuration changes, such as in the following circumstances: \u0002 Activating or deactivating an LPAR \u0002 Changing the LPARs processing weights \u0002 Upgrading the system through a temporary or permanent record \u0002 Downgrading the system through deactivation of a temporary record PR/SM schedules a global reoptimization of the resources in use. It does so by",
