By using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task, you can add crypto adapters dynamically to an LPAR without an outage of the LPAR. Also, dynamic deletion or moving of these features does not require planning. Support is provided in z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, IBM SSC (based on appliance requirements), and Linux on IBM Z. LPAR dynamic PU reassignment The system configuration is enhanced to optimize the PU-to-CPC drawer assignment of physical processors dynamically. The initial assignment of client-usable physical processors to physical processor drawers can change dynamically to better suit the LPAR configurations that are in use.
