ICFs are dedicated or shared. ICFs can be dedicated to a CF LPAR, or shared by multiple CF LPARs that run on the same system. However, having an LPAR with dedicated and shared ICFs at the same time is not possible. Coupling Thin Interrupts With the introduction of Driver 15F (zEC12 and zBC12), the IBM z/Architecture provides a thin interrupt class called Coupling Thin Interrupts5. The capabilities that are provided by hardware, firmware, and software support the generation of coupling-related \u201cThin Interrupts\u201d when the following situations occur: \u0002 On the coupling facility (CF) side: \u2013 A CF command or a CF signal (arrival of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal) is received by a",
