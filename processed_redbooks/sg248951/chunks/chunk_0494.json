Note: The phrase channel subsystem has same meaning as logical channel subsystem in this section, unless otherwise stated. 200 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Channel paths A channel path provides a connection between the channel subsystem and control units that allows the channel subsystem to communicate with I/O devices. Depending on the type of connections, a channel path might be a physical connection to a control unit with I/O devices, such as FICON, or an internal logical control unit, such as HiperSockets. Each channel path in a channel subsystem features a unique 2-digit hexadecimal identifier that is known as a channel-path identifier (CHPID), which ranges 00 - FF. Therefore, a total of 256 CHPIDs are supported by a CSS, and a maximum of 1536 CHPIDs are available on an IBM z16 with six logical channel subsystems. By assigning a CHPID to",
