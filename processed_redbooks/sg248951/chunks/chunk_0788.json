Soft capping controls the maximum 4-hour rolling average usage (the last 4-hour average value at every 5-minute interval), but does not limit the maximum instantaneous partition use. You can also use an LPAR group capacity limit, which sets soft capping by PR/SM for a group of logical partitions that are running z/OS. Only the 4-hour rolling average use of the LPAR group is tracked, which allows use peaks above the group capacity value. \u0002 Sysplex licensing Sysplex licensing allows monthly software licenses to be aggregated across a qualified Parallel Sysplex.
