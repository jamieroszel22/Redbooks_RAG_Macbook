  "content": "IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Quantum-safe encryption with IBM z16 and Crypto Express8S Quantum-safe cryptography strengthens the portfolio of pervasive encryption capabilities on IBM z16, which allows customers to encrypt the data with a quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm (AES with 256-bit keys) as is the case with prior IBM Z buy using quantum-safe algorithms for internal system protection of encryption keys. The following Quantum-safe enhancements were introduced with IBM z16 to accomplish this encryption: \u0002 Key generation \u0002 Hybrid key exchange schemes \u0002 Dual digital signature schemes Crypto Analytics Tool for IBM Z The IBM Crypto Analytics Tool (CAT) for IBM Z is an analytics solution that collects data on your z/OS cryptographic infrastructure, presents reports, and analyzes if any vulnerabilities exist. CAT collects cryptographic information from across the enterprise and provides reports to help users better manage the crypto infrastructure and ensure it follows best",
