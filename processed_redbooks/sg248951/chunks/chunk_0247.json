A complete description of the rules is beyond the scope of this publication. The compilers and JVMs are responsible for selecting instructions that best fit with the superscalar microprocessor. They abide by the rules to create code that best uses the superscalar implementation. All IBM Z compilers and JVMs are constantly updated to benefit from new instructions and advances in microprocessor designs. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 97 3.4.14 Extended Translation Facility The z/Architecture instruction set includes instructions in support of the Extended Translation Facility. They are used in data conversion operations for Unicode data, which causes applications that are enabled for Unicode or globalization to be more efficient. These data-encoding formats are used in web services, grid, and on-demand environments in which XML and SOAP",
