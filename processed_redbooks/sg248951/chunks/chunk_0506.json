  "content": "across the server. MIF image ID The MIF image ID is defined as a parameter for each LPAR in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. It ranges 1 - F, and must be unique within an LCSS. However, duplicates are allowed in different LCSSs. If a MIF image ID is not defined, an arbitrary ID is assigned when the I/O configuration activated. The IBM z16 server supports a maximum of six LCSSs, with a total of 85 LPARs that can be defined. Each LCSS of an IBM z16 A01 system can support the following numbers of LPARs: \u0002 LCSS0 to LCSS4 support 15 LPARs each, and the MIF image ID is 1 - F. \u0002 LCSS5 supports 10 LPARs, and the MIF image IDs are 1 - A. LPAR ID The LPAR ID is defined by a user in an image activation profile for each LPAR. It is a 2-digit hexadecimal number 00 - 7F. The LPAR ID must be unique across the server. Although it is arbitrarily defined by the user, an LPAR ID often is the CSS ID concatenated to its MIF image ID, which makes the value more meaningful for the system",
