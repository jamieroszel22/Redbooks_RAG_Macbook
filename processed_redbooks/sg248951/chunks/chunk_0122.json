Figure 2-12 Conceptual overview of system control element A typical BMC operation is to control a power supply. An SE sends a command to the BMC to start the power supply. The BMC cycles the various components of the power supply, monitors the success of each step and the resulting voltages, and reports this status to the SE. SEs are duplexed (N+1), and each element has at least one BMC. Two internal Ethernet LAN switches and two SEs, for redundancy, and crossover connectivity between the LANs, are configured so that both SEs can operate on both LANs. The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and SEs are connected directly to one or two Ethernet Customer LANs. One or more HMCs can be used. With IBM z16 current ordered systems, the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA, FC 0129) is the only HMC-orderable feature. The",
