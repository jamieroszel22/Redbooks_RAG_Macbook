Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Dedicated processors are recommended for best performance and production use (continuous polling model). Shared processors are recommended for test and development use in which a CF image requires significantly less than one processor\u2019s worth of capacity, which encourages sharing CF processors across multiple CF images, or for less-performance critical production usage. In shared-processor mode, the CF can currently use several different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models: \u2013 DYNDISP=OFF LPAR time-slicing completely controls the CF processor; the processor polls the entire time that it is",
