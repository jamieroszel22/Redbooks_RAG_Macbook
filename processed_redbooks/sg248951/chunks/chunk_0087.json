  "content": "help with server consolidation by connecting virtual servers and simplifying the enterprise network. RoCE Express The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3 features4 use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory communications between two IBM Z platforms. These features help reduce consumption of CPU resources for applications that use the TCP/IP stack (such as IBM WebSphere\u00ae that accesses an IBM Db2\u00ae database). They also can help reduce network latency with memory-to-memory transfers by using Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R). With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly and at low latency. SMC-R is transparent to the application and requires no code changes, which enables rapid time to value. The RoCE Express3 features also can provide LAN connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are",
