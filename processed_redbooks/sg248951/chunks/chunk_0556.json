Some of these algorithms can also run with a clear key on the CPACF. Many standards are supported only when Crypto Express8S is running in CCA mode. Others are supported only when the adapter is running in EP11 mode. The three modes for Crypto Express8S are described next. For more information, see 6.7, \u201cCryptographic functions comparison\u201d on page 242. 228 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 6.5.2 Crypto Express8S as a CCA coprocessor A Crypto Express8S adapter that is running in CCA mode supports IBM CCA. CCA is an architecture and a set of APIs. It provides cryptographic algorithms, secure key management, and many special functions that are required for banking. Over 129 APIs with more than 600 options are provided, with new functions and",
