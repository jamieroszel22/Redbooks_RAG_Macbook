Note: At least one permanent zIIP record must be present for ordering System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 6802). Important: The System Recovery Boost Upgrade record is for System Recovery Boost capacity only. It cannot be used for peak workload management. The customer must deactivate the boost capacity at the end of the system boost procedure. The zIIP capacity that is provided in the SRB Record is for LPAR shutdown and startup (IPL and Catchup) and is not available for process boost events. Note: The System Recovery Boost configuration is activated temporarily and provides up to a maximum of 20 extra zIIPs to the system\u2019s original, permanent configuration and can violate the 2:1 zIIP rule. The number of zIIPs that can be activated is limited by the unused capacity that is available on the system. Chapter 8.
