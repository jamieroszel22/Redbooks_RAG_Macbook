  "content": "the IEEE 802.1 standard. GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) support allows an OSA-Express port to register or unregister its VLAN IDs with a GVRP-capable switch and dynamically update its table as the VLANs change. This process simplifies the network administration and management of VLANs because manually entering VLAN IDs at the switch is no longer necessary. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. Chapter 7. Operating system support 309 Link aggregation support for z/VM Link aggregation (IEEE 802.3ad) that is controlled by the z/VM Virtual Switch (VSWITCH) allows the dedication of an OSA-Express port to the z/VM operating system. The port must be participating in an aggregated group that is configured in Layer 2 mode. Link aggregation (trunking) combines multiple physical OSA-Express ports into a single logical link. This configuration increases throughput, and provides nondisruptive failover if a port becomes unavailable.",
