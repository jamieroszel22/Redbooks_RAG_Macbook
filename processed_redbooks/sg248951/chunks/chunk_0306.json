For more information, see 3.7.5, \u201cLPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration\u201d on page 127. \u0002 Channels Channels can be shared between LPARs by including the partition name in the partition list of a channel-path identifier (CHPID). I/O configurations are defined by the IOCP or the HCD with the CHPID mapping tool (CMT). The CHPID Mapping Tool (CMT) is an optional tool that is used to map CHPIDs onto physical channel IDs (PCHIDs). PCHIDs represent the physical location of a port on a card in a PCIe I/O drawer. IOCP is available on the z/OS, z/VM, and z/VSE operating systems, and as a stand-alone program on the hardware console. For more information, see Input/Output Configuration Program User\u2019s Guide for ICP IOCP, SB10-7177. HCD is available on the z/OS and z/VM operating systems.
