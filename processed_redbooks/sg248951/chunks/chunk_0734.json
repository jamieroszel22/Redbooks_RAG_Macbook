The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express6S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity. Each adapter can be configured in the following modes: \u0002 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD \u0002 Non-QDIO, with CHPID type OSE \u0002 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
