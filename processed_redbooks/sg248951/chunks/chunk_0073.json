This knowledge can aid in developing a cryptographic inventory for migration and modernization planning. 4 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 1.1.1 Supported upgrade paths The supported upgrade paths for the IBM z16 A01 are shown in Figure 1-1. . Figure 1-1 IBM z16 A01 upgrade paths 1.1.2 Capacity and performance The IBM z16 A01 offers 317 capacity levels. In all, 200 capacity levels are based on the number of physically used CPs, plus up to 117 extra subcapacity models for the first 39 CPs. The IBM z16 provides increased processing and",
