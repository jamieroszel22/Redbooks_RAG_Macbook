It tracks register names, OoO instruction dependency, and handling of instruction resource dispatch. \u0002 Instruction fetching unit (IFU) (prediction): These units contain the instruction cache, branch prediction logic, instruction fetching controls, and buffers. Its relative size is the result of the elaborate branch prediction design. \u0002 Recovery unit (RU): The RU keeps a copy of the complete state of the system that includes all registers, collects hardware fault signals, and",
