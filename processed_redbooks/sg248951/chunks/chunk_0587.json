When one feature code is ordered, 10 smart cards are included. The order increment is 1 - 99 (10 - 990 blank smart cards). If smart cards with applets that are not supported by the new smart card reader are reused, new smart cards on TKE 8.1 or later must be created and the content from the old smart cards to the new smart cards must be copied. The new smart cards can be created and copied on a TKE 8.1 system. If the copies are done on TKE 9.0, the source smart card must be placed in an older smart card reader from feature code 0885 or 0891. A new smart card for the Trusted Key Entry (TKE) allows stronger Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) levels. More TKE Smart Cards (FC 0900, packs of 10, FIPS certified blanks) require TKE 9.1 LIC or up. 6.6.3 TKE hardware support and migration information The new TKE 10.0 LIC (FC 0882) is originally",
