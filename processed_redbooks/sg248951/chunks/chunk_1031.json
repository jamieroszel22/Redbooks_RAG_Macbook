With this support, the IBM z15 can receive the time from the HMC without accessing a LAN other than the HMC and SE network. When the HMC is used as an NTP server, it can be configured to receive the NTP source from the internet. For this type of configuration, a LAN that is separate from the HMC/SE LAN can be used.
