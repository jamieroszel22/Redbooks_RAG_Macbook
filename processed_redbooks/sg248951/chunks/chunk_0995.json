To address this issue, the following changes were made: \u0002 If a CPC is targeted, the initial window provides a global view of all OSA PCHIDs. \u0002 You can browse to various OSA Advanced Facilities subtasks from the initial window, which makes the process of getting to them less cumbersome. \u0002 Today\u2019s View Port Parameters and Display OAT Entries support exporting data of one OSA PCHID.
