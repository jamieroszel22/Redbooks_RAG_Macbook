  "content": "features the following characteristics: \u0002 IRD processor management WLM dynamically adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR and the processor weight based on the WLM policy. The ability to move the processor weights across an LPAR cluster provides processing power where it is most needed, based on WLM goal mode policy. The processor management function is automatically deactivated when HiperDispatch is active. However, the LPAR weight management function remains active with IRD with HiperDispatch. For more information about HiperDispatch, see 3.7, \u201cLogical partitioning\u201d on page 117. HiperDispatch manages the number of logical CPs in use. It adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR to achieve the optimal balance between CP resources and the requirements of the workload. HiperDispatch also adjusts the number of logical processors. The goal is to map the logical processor to as few physical processors as possible. This configuration uses the processor",
