Software-based compression algorithms can be costly in terms of processor resources, storage costs, and network bandwidth. An optional PCIe feature that was available for IBM z14 servers, zEDC Express, addressed customer requirements by providing hardware-based acceleration for data compression and decompression. zEDC provided data compression with lower CPU consumption than compression technology that was available on the IBM Z server. Customers deployed zEDC compression to deliver the following types of compression: \u0002 Storage \u0002 Data transfer \u0002 Database \u0002 In-application Data compression delivers the following benefits: \u0002 Disk space savings \u0002 Improved elapse times \u0002 Reduced CPU consumption \u0002 Reduced network bandwidth requirements and transfer",
