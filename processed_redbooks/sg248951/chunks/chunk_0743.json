QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization enables system programmers and network administrators to coordinate and simultaneously capture software and hardware traces. It allows z/OS to signal OSA-Express features (by using a diagnostic assist function) to stop traces and capture the current trace records. QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization is supported by the OSA-Express features on IBM z16 when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259. Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) for OSA Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) creates multiple input queues and allows OSA to differentiate workloads \u201coff the wire.\u201d It then assigns work to a specific input queue (per device) to z/OS. Each input queue is a unique type of workload, and has unique service and processing requirements. The IWQ function allows z/OS to preassign the appropriate",
