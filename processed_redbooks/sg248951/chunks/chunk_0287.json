However, memory upgrades cannot be done through CBU or On/Off CoD. \u0002 Concurrent memory upgrades if the physically installed capacity is reached Physical memory upgrades require a processor drawer to be removed and reinstalled after replacing the memory cards in the processor drawer. Except for the feature Max39, the combination of enhanced drawer availability and the flexible memory option allows you to concurrently add memory to the system. For more information, see 2.5.5, \u201cDrawer replacement and memory\u201d on page 45, and 2.5.7, \u201cFlexible Memory Option\u201d on page 46. When the total capacity that is installed has more usable memory than required for a configuration, the Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) determines how much memory is used from each processor drawer. The sum of the LICCC provided memory from each CPC drawer is the amount that is",
