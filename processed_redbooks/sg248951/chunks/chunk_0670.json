  "content": "support 281 The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC maintains software compatibility with zEDC Express use cases. For more information, see Integrated Acceleratorfor zEnterprise Data Compression. The z/OS zEDC capability is a software-priced feature that is designed to support compression capable hardware. With IBM z16, the zEDC feature is implemented in the on-chip compression accelerator unit, but the software (z/OS) component is required to maintain the same functions as previous PCIe-based zEDC features. All data interchange with zEDC compressed data remains compatible as IBM z16 and zEDC capable machines coexist (accessing same data). Data that is compressed and written with zEDC can be read and decompressed by IBM z16 well into the future. The on-chip compression unit has the following operating modes: \u0002 Synchronous execution in Problem State, where user application starts instruction in its virtual address space. This mode provides low latency and high-bandwidth compression and",
