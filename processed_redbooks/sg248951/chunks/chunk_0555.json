The ECDSA algorithms that are recommended by this group are supported. \u0002 ECDH (192, 224, 256, 384, and 521 Prime/NIST) Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is an asymmetric protocol that is used for key agreement between two parties by using ECC-based private keys. The recommendations by NIST are supported. \u0002 ECDH (160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and 512 BrainPool) ECDH according to the Brainpool recommendations. \u0002 Montgomery Modular Math Engine The Montgomery Modular Math Engine is a method for fast modular multiplication. Many crypto systems, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman key Exchange, can use this method. \u0002 Clear Key Fast Path (Symmetric and Asymmetric) This mode of operation gives a direct",
