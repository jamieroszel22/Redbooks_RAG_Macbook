Asynchronous CF Duplexing for lock structures requires the following software support: \u0002 z/OS V2R5, V2R4 \u0002 z/OS V2R3 with PTFs for APAR OA47796 and OA49148 \u0002 z/VM V7R3, V7R2 or V7R1 \u0002 Db2 V12 with PTFs for APAR PI66689 \u0002 IRLM V2.R3 with PTFs for APAR PI68378 The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-5 on page 256. Asynchronous cross-invalidate for CF cache structures Asynchronous cross-invalidate (XI) for CF cache structures enables improved efficiency in CF data sharing by adopting a more transactional behavior for cross-invalidate (XI) processing. This processing is used to maintain coherency and consistency of data managers\u2019 local buffer pools across the sysplex. Instead of performing XI signals synchronously on every cache update request that causes them, data managers can \u201copt in\u201d for the CF to perform these XIs asynchronously (and then synchronize them with the CF",
