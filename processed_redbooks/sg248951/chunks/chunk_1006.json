Figure 10-22 Change LPAR Group Controls: Group absolute capping Absolute capping is specified as an absolute number of processors to which the group's activity is capped. The value is specified to hundredths of a processor (for example, 4.56 processors) worth of capacity. The value is not tied to the Licensed Internal Code (LIC) configuration code (LICCC). Any value 0.01 - 255.00 can be specified. This configuration makes the profiles more portable, 434 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide which means that you do not encounter problems when profiles are migrated to new machines. Although the absolute cap can be specified to hundredths of a processor, the exact amount might not be that precise. The same factors that influence the \u201cmachine capacity\u201d also influence the precision with which the absolute capping works. LPAR absolute capping can be changed through scheduled operations start. 10.5.3 HMC and SE remote operations Because",
