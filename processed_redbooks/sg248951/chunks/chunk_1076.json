  "content": "ratings across the individual LSPR workloads is likely to include a large spread. Performance of the individual logical partitions (LPARs) varies depending on the fluctuating resource requirements of other partitions and the availability of processor units (PUs). Therefore, it is important to know which LSPR workload type suite your production environment. For more information, see 12.8, \u201cWorkload performance variation\u201d on page 483. For more information about performance, see this web page of the IBM Resource Link website. For more information about millions of service units (MSU) ratings, see this IBM Z resources web page. 12.2.1 LSPR workload suite Historically, LSPR capacity tables, including pure workloads and mixes, were identified with application names or a software characteristic; for example, CICS, IMS, OLTP-T,1 CB-L,2 LoIO-mix,3 and TI-mix.4 However, capacity performance is more closely associated with how a workload uses and interacts with a specific processor hardware",
