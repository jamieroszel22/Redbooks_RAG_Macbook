  "content": "this requirement. \u0002 Resource sharing: Several base z/OS components use CF shared storage. This configuration enables sharing of physical resources with significant improvements in cost, performance, and simplified systems management. \u0002 Single logical system: The collection of system images in the Parallel Sysplex is displayed as a single entity to the operator, user, and database administrator. A single system view means reduced complexity from operational and definition perspectives. \u0002 N-2 support: Multiple hardware generations (normally three) are supported in the same Parallel Sysplex. This configuration provides for a gradual evolution of the systems in the Parallel Sysplex without changing all of them simultaneously. Software support for multiple releases or versions also is supported. Through state-of-the-art cluster technology, the power of multiple images can be harnessed to work in concert on common workloads. The IBM Z Parallel Sysplex cluster takes the commercial strengths",
