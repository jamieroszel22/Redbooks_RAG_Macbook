If the memory fails, it is technically feasible to run a POR of the system with the remaining working memory resources. After the POR completes, the memory distribution across the processor drawers is different, as is the total amount of available memory. Large page support By default, page frames are allocated with a 4 KB size. IBM z16 servers also support large page sizes of 1 MB or 2 GB. The first z/OS release that supports 1 MB pages is z/OS V1R9. Linux on IBM Z 1 MB pages support is available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.2 and later. The TLB reduces the amount of time that is required to translate a virtual address to a real address. This translation is done by dynamic address translation (DAT) when it must find the correct page for the correct",
