  "content": "DISCLAIMER: IBM z16 with the Crypto Express 8S card provides quantum-safe APIs and access to quantum-safe algorithms that were selected as finalists during the PQC standardization process that was conducted by NIST (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions). Quantum-safe cryptography refers to efforts to identify algorithms that are resistant to attacks by classic and quantum computers to keep information assets secure, even after a large-scale quantum computer is built. (https://www.etsi.org/technologies/quantum-safe-cryptography). These algorithms are used to help ensure the integrity of several firmware and boot processes. IBM z16 is the Industry-first system that is protected by quantum-safe technology across multiple layers of firmware. 12 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide \u2013 OSA-Express7S (carry forward only) \u2013 OSA-Express6S (carry forward only) \u2013 RoCE Express3 (new build only) \u2013 RoCE Express2.1 (carry forward only) \u2013 RoCE Express2 (carry forward",
