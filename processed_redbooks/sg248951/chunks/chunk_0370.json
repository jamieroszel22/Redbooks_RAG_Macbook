This configuration reduces the encoding overhead to approximately 1.54% versus the PCIe Generation 2 overhead of 20% that uses 8b/10b encoding. The PCIe standard uses a low-voltage differential serial bus. Two wires are used for signal transmission, and a total of four wires (two for transmit and two for receive) form a lane of a PCIe link, which is full-duplex. Multiple lanes can be aggregated into a larger link width. PCIe supports link widths of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32 lanes (x1, x2, x4, x8, x12, x16, and x32). The data transmission rate of a PCIe link is determined by the link width (numbers of",
