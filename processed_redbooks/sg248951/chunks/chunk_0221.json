  "content": "superscalar PU core can have up to 10 instructions or operations that are running per cycle. This technology results in shorter workload runtime. Enhanced branch prediction If the branch prediction logic of the microprocessor makes the wrong prediction, all instructions in the parallel pipelines are removed. The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible. 84 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide For this reason, various history-based branch prediction mechanisms are used, as shown in the in-order part of the IBM z16 PU core logical diagram in Figure 3-11. The branch target buffer (BTB) runs ahead of instruction cache prefetches to prevent branch misses in an early stage. Furthermore, a branch history table (BHT) offers a high branch prediction success rate in combination with a pattern history table (PHT) and the use of tagged multi-target",
