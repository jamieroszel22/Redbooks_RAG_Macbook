The Crypto Express7S can also be configured as one of the following configurations: \u0002 The Secure IBM CCA coprocessor includes secure key functions with an emphasis on the specialized functions that are required for banking and payment card systems. It is optionally programmable to add custom functions and algorithms by using UDX. A new mode (called PCI-HSM) is available exclusively for Crypto Express6S in CCA mode. PCI-HSM mode simplifies compliance with PCI requirements for hardware security modules. \u0002 The Secure IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) coprocessor implements an industry-standardized set of services that adheres to the PKCS #11 specification v2.20 and more recent amendments. It was designed for extended FIPS and Common Criteria evaluations to meet industry requirements. This cryptographic coprocessor mode introduced the PKCS #11 secure key function. When",
