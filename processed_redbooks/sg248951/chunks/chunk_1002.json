  "content": "configuration data set (IOCDS) includes definitions of LPARs, channel subsystems, control units, and devices, and their accessibility from LPARs. IOCDS can be created and put into production from the HMC. The HMC is used to start the power-on reset (POR) of the system. During the POR, processor units (PUs) are characterized and placed into their respective pools, memory is put into a single storage pool, and the IOCDS is loaded into and started in the hardware system area (HSA). The hardware messages task displays hardware-related messages at the CPC, LPAR, or SE level. It also displays hardware messages that relate to the HMC. 10.5.2 LPAR management Use the HMC to define LPAR properties, such as the number of processors of each type, how many are reserved, and how much memory is assigned to it. These parameters are defined in LPAR profiles and stored on the SE. Because PR/SM must manage LPAR access to processors and the initial weights of each partition, weights are used to",
