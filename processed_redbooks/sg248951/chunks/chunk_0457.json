  "content": "communications between applications for server-to-server (SMC-R) or LPAR-to-LPAR (SMC-D) connectivity. Shared Memory Communications Version 1 The following versions of SMC are available: \u0002 SMC-R SMC-R provides application transparent use of the RoCE-Express feature. This feature reduces the network overhead and latency of data transfers, which effectively offers the benefits of optimized network performance across processors. \u0002 SMC-D SMC-D was used with the introduction of the Internal Shared Memory (ISM) virtual PCI function. ISM is a virtual PCI network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory, which provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z intra-CPC communications. SMC-D maintains the socket-API transparency aspect of SMC-R so that applications that use TCP/IP communications can benefit immediately without requiring any application software or IP topology changes. SMC-D completes the overall SMC solution, which provides synergy with SMC-R.",
