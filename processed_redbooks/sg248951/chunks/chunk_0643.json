  "content": "SMP factor based on the workload demands. For more information about CPU polarization support in Linux on IBM Z, see this IBM Documentation web page. z/TPF z/TPF on IBM z16 can use more processors immediately without reactivating the LPAR or IPLing the z/TPF system. When z/TPF is running in a shared processor configuration, the achieved MIPS is higher when z/TPF uses a minimum set of processors. In low-use periods, z/TPF minimizes the processor footprint by compressing TPF workload onto a minimal set of I-streams (engines), which reduces the effect on other LPARs and allows the entire CPC to operate more efficiently. As a consequence, z/OS and z/VM experience less contention from the z/TPF system when the z/TPF system is operating at periods of low demand. Chapter 7. Operating system support 271 The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. zIIP support zIIPs do not change the model capacity identifier of IBM z16 servers.
