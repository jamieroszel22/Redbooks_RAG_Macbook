  "content": "The same domain also must be allocated to the ICSF instance that is running in the logical partition that uses the Options data set. \u0002 Each ICSF instance accesses only the Master Keys or queue registers that correspond to the domain number that is specified in the logical partition image profile at the SE and in its Options data set. Each ICSF instance sees a logical cryptographic coprocessor that consists of the physical cryptographic engine and the unique set of registers (the domain) that is allocated to this logical partition. The installation of CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) DES/TDES enablement (FC 3863) is required to use the Crypto Express7S feature. Each Crypto Express8S FC 0908 includes two IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessors (PCIeCC), which is a hardware security module (HSM); FC 0909 includes one IBM 4770 PCIeCC. The adapters are available in the following configurations: \u0002 IBM Enterprise Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) Coprocessor (CEX8C) \u0002 IBM",
