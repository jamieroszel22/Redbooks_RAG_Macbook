The PPC card also includes pressure, temperature, and humidity sensors. 2.3 Dual chip modules The DCM is a multi-layer metal substrate module that holds two PU chips. The PU chip size is 530 mm2 and has 22.5 billion transistors. Each CPC drawer has four PU DCMs. The PU DCM is shown in Figure 2-13. The DCM features a thermal cap that is placed over the chips. Each DCM is water-cooled by way of a cold plate manifold assembly. Figure 2-13 Dual chip modules (PU DCM) PU chips use 7 nm FinFET process, each DCM socket contains 4753 pins, and the module size is 71.5 mm x 79 mm. The DCMs are each plugged into a socket that is part of the CPC drawer packaging. Each DCM is cooled by water flowing through a manifold assembly where cold plates are attached and used to help remove the heat from the processor chips. Chapter 2.
