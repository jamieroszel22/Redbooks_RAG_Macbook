The result of the preparation task is a list of resources that must be made available before the drawer replacement can occur. Freeing any resources At this stage, create a plan to free these resources. The following resources and actions are necessary to free them: \u0002 Freeing any PUs: \u2013 Vary off the PUs by using the Perform a Model Conversion window, which reduces the number of PUs in the shared PU pool. \u2013 Deactivate the LPARs. \u0002 Freeing memory: \u2013 Deactivate an LPAR. \u2013 Vary offline a portion of the reserved (online) memory. For example, in z/OS, run the following command: CONFIG_STOR(E=1),<OFFLINE/ONLINE> This command enables a storage element to be taken offline. The size of the storage element depends on the RSU value. In z/OS, the following command configures offline smaller amounts of storage than the amount that was set for the storage element: CONFIG_STOR(nnM),<OFFLINE/ONLINE> \u2013 A combination",
