It prevents multiple systems from running ICKDSF on the same volume, and at the same time allows user applications to run while ICKDSF is processing. To prevent data corruption, ICKDSF must determine all sharing systems that might run ICKDSF. Therefore, this support is required for IBM z16. z/OS Discovery and Auto-Configuration z/OS Discovery and Auto Configuration (zDAC) is designed to automatically run several I/O configuration definition tasks for new and changed disk and tape controllers that are connected to a switch or director, when attached to a FICON channel. The zDAC function is integrated into the hardware configuration definition (HCD). Clients can define a policy that can include preferences for availability and bandwidth that include parallel access volume (PAV) definitions, control unit numbers, and device",
