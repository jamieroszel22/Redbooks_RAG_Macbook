The inactive part of the Flexible Capacity record floats on top of the TFP-Hardware capacity. System A is in a Sysplex with System B that has the same configuration. Now, the data-center operator decides to perform maintenance on System A and transfers its active Flexible Capacity to System B. 526 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Figure D-11shows the configuration of both machines after the transfer. Figure D-11 Flexible Capacity with two site sysplex - transfer System A transferred all of its Flexible Capacity to System B and is left with only the base capacity of 401. On top of the base capacity sits the TFP-Hardware capacity. Now, System A can safely perform maintenance. System B has now the entire Flexible Capacity record activated and shows an active capacity of 720. The TFP-Hardware capacity sits again on top of the active capacity and adds now another 2",
