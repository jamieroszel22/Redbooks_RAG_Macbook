An operating system with SMT support can be configured to dispatch work to a thread on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM) core in single-thread or SMT mode.

Operating system support 275 When PROCVIEW CORE or CORE,CPU_OK are specified in z/OS that is running on an IBM z16, HiperDispatch is forced to run as enabled, and you cannot disable HiperDispatch. The PROCVIEW statement cannot be changed dynamically; therefore, you must re-IPL after changing it to make the new setting effective. The MT_ZIIP_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx controls zIIP SMT mode. It can be 1 (the default), where only one thread can be running in a core, or 2, where up two threads can be running in a core. If PROCVIEW CPU is specified, the MT_ZIIP_MODE is always 1. Otherwise, the",
