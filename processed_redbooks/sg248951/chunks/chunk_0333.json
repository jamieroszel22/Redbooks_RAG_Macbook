For more information about CFCC requirements for supported systems, see \u201cCoupling facility and CFCC considerations\u201d on page 281. Note: Parallel sysplex coupling and timing links connectivity for IBM z16 (M/T 3931) is supported to N-2 generation CPCs (IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14). Consideration: IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 servers cannot coexist in the same sysplex with z13/z13s or earlier generation systems. 132 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide CFCC Level 25 CFCC level 25 is delivered on the IBM z16 (M/T 3931) with driver level 51 adds the following features: \u0002 New cache residency time metrics for directory/data entries are available. These new metrics allow exploiters (such as Db2) to provide direct, useful feedback on the CF cache structure \u201ccache",
