  "content": "Gigabit Ethernet SR (FC 0429) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O Drawer when carried forward to an IBM z16. The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE Short Reach (SR) feature includes one PCIe adapter and one port per feature. The port supports CHPID types OSD. The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE feature is designed to support attachment to a multimode fiber 25 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 25 Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device has an SR transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SR to SR). The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only. Note: CHPID types OSM, OSN, and OSX are not supported on IBM z16. 176 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide A",
