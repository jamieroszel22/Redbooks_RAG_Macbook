Channel spanning is supported for internal links (HiperSockets and IC links) and for specific types of external links. External links that are supported on IBM z16 A01 systems include FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, FICON Express16S+, OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, OSA-Express6S, and Coupling Links. Chapter 5. Central processor complex channel subsystem 205 The definition of LPAR name, MIF image ID, and LPAR ID are used to identify an LPAR by the channel subsystem to identify I/O functions from different LPARs of multiple LCSSs, which support the implementation of these dedicated, shared, and spanned paths. An example of definition of these LPAR-related identifications is shown in Figure 5-4. Figure 5-4 CSS, LPAR, and identifier example LPAR name The LPAR name is defined as partition name parameter in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. The LPAR name must be unique",
