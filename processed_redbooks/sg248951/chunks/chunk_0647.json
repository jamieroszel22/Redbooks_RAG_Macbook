  "content": "provides a memory area to record the original contents of affected registers and memory as instruction execution occurs. If the transactional execution group is canceled or must be rolled back, the hardware transactional memory is used to reset the values. Software can implement a fallback capability. This capability increases the software\u2019s efficiency by providing a way to avoid locks (lock elision). This advantage is of special importance for speculative code generation and highly parallelized applications. TX is used by IBM Java virtual machine (JVM) and might be used by other software. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. System Recovery Boost System Recovery Boost is a feature that was implemented on the IBM z15 system. The feature provides more temporary processor capacity and delivers substantially faster system shutdown and restart and critical system operations, such as stand-alone dump, short duration Recovery process",
