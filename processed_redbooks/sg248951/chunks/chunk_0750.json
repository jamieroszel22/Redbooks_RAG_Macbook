This situation also applies to Layer 3 mode and to an OSA port spanned among channel subsystems. OSA Layer 3 VMAC is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16 when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259. Network Traffic Analyzer IBM Z servers offer systems programmers and network administrators the ability to more easily solve network problems despite high traffic. With the OSA-Express Network Traffic Analyzer and QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization on the server, you can capture trace and trap data. This data can then be forwarded to z/OS tools for easier problem determination and resolution. The Network Traffic Analyzer is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16 when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD).
