Crypto Express8S (dual HSM) has two hardware security modules (HSMs) per feature. The HSM is one IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCIeCC). The maximum number of HSMs per A01 system (combining all cryptographic features) is 60. The maximum number of single HSM (port) cryptographic features is 16 (CEX8S [single HSM], CEX7S [1 port], and CEX6S). Number of PCIe cryptographic adapters for each feature 0908 (coprocessor or accelerator) 2 Number of PCIe cryptographic adapters for each feature 0909 (coprocessor or accelerator) 1 Number of cryptographic domains at IBM z16 for each PCIe adapterc c. More than one partition, which is defined to the same channel subsystem (CSS) or to different CSSs, can use the same domain number when assigned to different PCIe",
