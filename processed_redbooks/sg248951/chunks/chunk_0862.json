You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file. The details of extra capacity and the rules for its provisioning are stored in a policy file. These two files are created and maintained through the Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC). The operational flow of Capacity Provisioning is shown in Figure 8-13 on page 360. 360 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Figure 8-13 The capacity provisioning process and infrastructure The z/OS WLM manages the workload by goals and business importance on each z/OS system.
