IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression 511 Software support On-Chip Compression function is compatible with zEDC support and is available in z/OS V2R2 and later for data compression and decompression. Although support for data recovery (decompression) if zEDC or On-Chip Compression not available, it is provided through software in z/OS V2R2 with the appropriate program temporary fixes (PTFs). Software decompression is slow and can involve considerable processor resources. Therefore, it is not recommended for production environments. A specific fix category that is named IBM.Function.zEDC identifies the fixes that enable or use the zEDC and On-Chip Compression function. z/OS guests that run under z/VM V7.R1 with PTFs and later can use the zEDC Express feature and IBM z16 On-Chip Compression.
