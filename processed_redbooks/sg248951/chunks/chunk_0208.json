The IBM z16 A01 inter-CPC drawer communication structure is shown in Figure 3-6. Figure 3-6 IBM z16 CPC drawer communication topology A simplified topology of a four-CPC drawer system is shown in Figure 3-7. Figure 3-7 Point-to-point topology with four CPC drawers Inter-CPC drawer communication occurs at the Level 4 virtual cache level, which is implemented on the semi-private part of one of the Level 2 caches in a chip module. The Level 4 cache function regulates coherent drawer-to-drawer traffic. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 77 3.4 Processor unit design Processor cycle time is especially important for processor-intensive applications. Current systems design is driven by processor cycle time, although improved cycle time does not automatically mean that the performance characteristics of the system",
