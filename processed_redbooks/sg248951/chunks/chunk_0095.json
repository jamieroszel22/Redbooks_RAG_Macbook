  "content": "98. 1.3 Hardware management The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and Support Elements (SEs) are appliances that together provide platform management for IBM Z. The HMC is an appliance that provides a single point of control for managing local or remote hardware elements. For IBM z16 new built systems, IBM Z Hardware Management Appliance (FC 0129) is the only available HMC. The HMC Appliance and SE Appliance run virtualized on the SE hardware. Older stand-alone HMCs (rack-mounted or tower) can be carried forward during an MES upgrade to IBM z16. For more information, see Chapter 10, \u201cHardware Management Console and Support Element\u201d on page 407. 6 The Crypto Express8S is available with either one or two hardware security modules (HSM). The HSM is the IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCIeCC). 7 The Crypto Express7S comes with either one (1-port) or two (2-port) hardware security modules (HSM). The HSM is the IBM 4769 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCIeCC). 8 ICA SR and ICA",
