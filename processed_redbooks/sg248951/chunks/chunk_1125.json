  "content": "times Many customers increased their zEDC footprint to 8 GBps with up to 16 features per IBM z14 system at 1 GBps throughput per feature (redundancy reduces total throughput to 8 GBps). Although the zEDC PCIe feature provided CPU savings by offloading the select compression and decompression operations, it included the drawback of limited virtualization capabilities (one zEDC PCIe feature can be shared across a maximum of 15 LPARs) and limited bandwidth. IBM z15 introduced an on-chip accelerator (implemented in the PU chip) for compression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor\u2019s L3 cache. As a result, it provided much higher bandwidth and removed the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature. The IBM z16 further addresses the growth of data compression requirements with the integrated on-chip compression unit (implemented in processor Nest, one per PU chip) that significantly increases compression throughput and speed compared to previous zEDC",
