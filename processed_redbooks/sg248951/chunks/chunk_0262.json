CF processor combinations A CF image can have one of the following combinations that are defined in the image profile: \u0002 Dedicated ICFs \u0002 Shared ICFs \u0002 Dedicated CPs \u0002 Shared CPs Shared ICFs add flexibility. However, running only with shared coupling facility PUs (ICFs or CPs) is not a preferable production configuration. It is preferable for a production CF to operate by using dedicated ICFs. 5 It is the only option for shared processors in a CF image (whether they be ICFs or CPs) on IBM z16. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 103 In Figure 3-18, the CPC on the left has two environments that are defined (production and test), and each has one z/OS and one coupling facility image. The coupling facility images share an ICF. Figure 3-18 ICF options - shared ICFs The LPAR processing weights are used to define how much processor capacity each CF image can include. The capped option also can be set for a test CF image to protect the",
