Quantum technology can be used for incredible good, but in the hands of an adversary, it has the potential to weaken or break core cryptographic primitives that were used to secure systems and communications. Quantum-safe cryptography aims to provide protection against attacks that can be started by quantum computers. The IBM z16 uses quantum-safe",
