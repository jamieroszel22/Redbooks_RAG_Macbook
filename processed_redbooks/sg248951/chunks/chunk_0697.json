When the IDAW flag is set, the data address in the CCW points to a list of words (IDAWs). Each IDAW contains an address that designates a data area within real storage. Figure 7-2 IDAW usage The number of required IDAWs for a CCW is determined by the following factors: \u0002 IDAW format as specified in the operation request block (ORB) \u0002 Count field of the CCW \u0002 Data address in the initial IDAW 10 Exceptions are made to this statement, and many details are omitted in this description.
