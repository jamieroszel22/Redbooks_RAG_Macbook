Now, BTB1 and BTB2 feature dynamic (variable) capacity: \u0002 BTB1: First Level Branch Target Buffer, smaller than IBM z15, dynamic director, variable capacity: \u2013 Minimum total branches in all parents (all large branches) = 8 K \u2013 Maximum total branches in all parents (all medium branches) = 12 K \u0002 BTB2: Second Level Branch Target Buffer, also variable capacity (variable directory), up to 260 k branches Branch prediction also implements auxiliary predictors for: \u0002 Direction: \u2013 Two table TAGE4 Pattern History Table (PHT): A two-level table (with different history lengths). Branch direction is predicted based on history. \u2013 Perceptron: Called a Perceptron because this is a neural network algorithm that learns to correlate branch history over time and predicts direction of branches that the other mechanisms cannot catch with sufficient",
