  "content": "for the group and the capacity that is optionally defined for each individual LPAR. LPAR absolute capping Absolute capping is a logical partition control that was made available with zEC12 and is supported on IBM z16 systems. With this support, PR/SM and the HMC are enhanced to support a new option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP), zIIP, or an IFL processor that is shared across a set of LPARs. Unlike traditional LPAR capping, absolute capping is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) value that is not affected by changes to the virtual or physical configuration of the system. Absolute capping provides an optional maximum capacity setting for logical partitions that is specified in the absolute processors capacity (for example, 5.00 CPs or 2.75 IFLs). This setting is specified independently by processor type (namely CPs,",
