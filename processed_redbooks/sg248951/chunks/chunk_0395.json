The preassigned PCHID number of each I/O port relates directly to its physical location (jack location in a specific slot). Chapter 4. Central processor complex I/O structure 161 4.6 Connectivity I/O channels are part of the CSS. They provide connectivity for data exchange between servers, between servers and external control units (CUs) and devices, or between networks. For more information about connectivity to external I/O subsystems (for example, disks), see 4.6.2, \u201cStorage connectivity\u201d on page 165. For more information about communication to LANs, see 4.6.3, \u201cNetwork connectivity\u201d on page 173. Communication between servers is implemented by using CE LR, ICA SR, or channel-to-channel (FICON CTC) connections. For more information, see 4.6.4, \u201cParallel Sysplex connectivity\u201d on page 187. 4.6.1 I/O feature",
