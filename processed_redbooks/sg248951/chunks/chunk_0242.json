  "content": "C/C++ applications tend to use IEEE BFP operations more frequently than earlier applications. Therefore, the better the hardware implementation of this set of instructions, the better the performance of applications. 3.4.9 Processor error detection and recovery The PU uses a process called transient recovery as an error recovery mechanism. When an error is detected, the instruction unit tries the instruction the instruction again, and attempts to recover the error. If the second attempt is unsuccessful (that is, a permanent fault exists), a relocation process is started that restores the full capacity by moving work to another PU. Relocation under hardware control is possible because the R-unit has the full designed state in its buffer. PU error detection and recovery are shown in Figure 3-17. Figure 3-17 PU error detection and recovery Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 95 3.4.10 Branch prediction Because of the ultra-high frequency of the PUs, the penalty for a wrongly",
