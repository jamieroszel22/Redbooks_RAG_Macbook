  "content": "response times that are required by new workload-type applications. This performance is achieved by high-frequency, enhanced superscalar processor technology, out-of-order core execution, large high-speed buffers (cache) and memory, an architecture with multiple complex instructions, and high-bandwidth channels. \u0002 Offer the high capacity and scalability that are required by the most demanding applications, from the single-system and clustered-systems points of view. \u0002 Offer the capability of concurrent upgrades for processors, memory, and I/O connectivity, which prevents system outages in planned situations. \u0002 Implement a system with high availability and reliability. These goals are achieved with redundancy of critical elements and sparing components of a single system, and the clustering technology of the Parallel Sysplex environment. \u0002 Have internal and external connectivity offerings, supporting open standards, such as Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). \u0002",
