  "content": "the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). The maximum number of characterizable PUs depends on the IBM z16 Model A01 CPC drawer feature code. Some PUs are characterized for system use; some are characterized for client workload use. By default, one spare PU is available to assume the function of a failed PU. The maximum number of PUs that can be characterized for client use are listed in Table 2-5. Table 2-5 PU characterization The rule for the CP to zIIP purchase ratio, that for every CP purchased, up to two zIIPs can be purchased has been removed on z16. Converting a PU from one type to any other type is possible by using the Dynamic Processor Unit Reassignment process. These conversions occur concurrently with the system operation.
