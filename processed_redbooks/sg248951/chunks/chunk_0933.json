  "content": "design of the IBM z16 further improved this chip marking technology. Graduated DRAM marking is available, and channel marking and scrubbing calls for replacement on the third DRAM failure is available. For more information about the memory system on IBM z16 A01, see 2.5, \u201cMemory\u201d on page 37. \u0002 Soft-switch firmware IBM z16 is equipped with the capabilities of soft-switching firmware. Enhanced logic in this function ensures that every affected circuit is powered off during the soft-switching of firmware components. For example, when you are upgrading the microcode of a FICON feature, enhancements are implemented to avoid any unwanted side effects that were detected on previous systems. \u0002 Server Time Protocol (STP) recovery enhancement. IBM z16 updated the clocking structure: \u2013 System uses a mesosynchronous clocking structure (similar to IBM z15) \u2013 Two redundant oscillator cards in each drawer with dynamic oscillator switchover \u2013 STP now has external clock reference support, separate",
