Because HiperSockets does not use an external network, it can free up system and network resources. This advantage can help eliminate attachment costs and improve availability and performance. HiperSockets eliminates the need to use I/O subsystem operations and traverse an external network connection to communicate between LPARs in the same IBM z16 CPC. 186 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide HiperSockets offers significant value in server consolidation when connecting many virtual servers. It can be used instead of certain coupling link configurations in a Parallel Sysplex. HiperSockets internal networks support the following transport modes: \u0002 Layer 2 (link layer) \u0002 Layer 3 (network or IP layer) Traffic can be IPv4 or IPv6, or non-IP, such as AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA.
