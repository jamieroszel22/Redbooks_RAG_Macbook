However, the maximum number of ICFs that can be defined on a coupling facility LPAR is limited to 16. ICFs are orderable by using FC 1960. Unassigned ICFs New on IBM z16, an ICF that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned ICF (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present. The allowable number of ICFs and Unassigned ICFs for each model is listed in Table 3-2. Table 3-2 ICFs and Unassigned ICFs per feature ICFs exclusively run CFCC. ICFs do not change the model capacity identifier of the IBM z16 system. Software product license charges that are based on the model capacity identifier are not affected by the addition of ICFs. All ICFs within a configuration are grouped into the ICF pool. The ICF pool can be seen on the HMC workplace. Features Max39 Max82 Max125 Max168 Max200 Maximum of",
