Cryptographic features 215 6.3 Cryptography on IBM z16 In principle, cryptographic algorithms can run on processor hardware. However, these workloads are compute-intensive, and the handling of secure keys also requires special hardware protection. Therefore, IBM Z offer several cryptographic hardware features, which are specialized to meet the requirements for cryptographic workload. The cryptographic hardware that is supported on IBM z16 is shown in Figure 6-2. These features are described in this chapter. Figure 6-2 Cryptographic hardware that is supported in IBM z16 Implemented in every processor unit (PU) or core in a central processor complex (CPC) is a cryptographic coprocessor that can be used2 for cryptographic algorithms that uses clear keys or protected keys.
