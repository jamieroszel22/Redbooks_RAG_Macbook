An SE can have the following IP addresses: \u0002 Statically assigned IPv4 or statically assigned IPv6 \u0002 Auto-configured IPv6 as link-local or router-advertised IP addresses on the SE cannot be dynamically assigned through DHCP to ensure repeatable address assignments. DHCP privacy extensions are not used on the SE. The HMC uses IPv4 and IPv6 multi-casting1 to automatically discover the SEs. The HMC Network Diagnostic Information task can be used to identify the IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), which are used by the HMC",
