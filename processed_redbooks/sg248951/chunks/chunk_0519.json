  "content": "\u0002 It is harder to exchange a compromised algorithm than to exchange a compromised key. \u0002 Secret algorithms can be reconstructed by reverse engineering software or hardware implementations. \u0002 Errors in public algorithms can generally be found more easily, when many experts examine it. \u0002 In history, most secret encryption methods proved to be weak and inadequate. \u0002 When a secret encryption method is used, it is possible that a back door was built in. \u0002 If an algorithm is public, many experts can form an opinion about it. Also, the method can be more thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 6.2.3 Keys The keys that are used for the cryptographic algorithms often are sequences of numbers and characters, but can also be any other sequence of bits. The length of a key influences the security (strength) of the cryptographic method. The longer the used key, the more difficult it is to compromise a cryptographic algorithm. For example, the DES (symmetric key)",
