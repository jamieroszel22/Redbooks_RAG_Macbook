For more information, see Chapter 10, \u201cHardware Management Console and Support Element\u201d on page 407. Coupling Express2 LR does not support the \u201cgoing away signal\u201d; however, ECAR can be used to assist with recovery in the following configurations: \u0002 Design of pervasive infrastructure controls in processor chips in memory ASICs. \u0002 Improved error checking in the processor recovery unit (RU) to better protect against word line failures in the RU arrays. 9.8 Enhanced drawer availability EDA is a procedure in which a drawer in a multi-drawer system can be removed and",
