Note: You should create an EDF file for each z/VM system and load all the EDFs for the same CPC into IBM zPCR at the same time so to ensure that the correct LSPR Workload is assigned to each LPAR. IBM zPCR supports using drag-n-drop for multiple EDF files. 486 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Figure 12-5 IBM zPCR LPAR Configuration from EDF window 12.9.4 IBM z16 Performance Best Practices Understand and follow the IBM z16 best practices and use the following tips to get the most efficiency, best performance and best throughput of the IBM z16: \u0002 Collect the CPU MF counters (z/OS SMF 113s) on all LPARs. (CPU MF runs on every IBM z16 supported Operating Systems OS), see: http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TC000066 \u2013 For z/OS, capture correlator SMF 98 subtype 1. \u2022 Provides supervisor information in five seconds intervals and helps perform performance problem analysis.
