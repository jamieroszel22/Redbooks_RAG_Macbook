The zDAC proposed configurations are created as work I/O definition files (IODFs) that can be converted to production IODFs and activated. zDAC is designed to run discovery for all systems in a sysplex that support the function. Therefore, zDAC helps to simplify I/O configuration on IBM z16 systems that run z/OS, and reduces complexity and setup time. zDAC applies to all FICON features that are supported on IBM z16 when configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258. Platform and name server registration in FICON channel The FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features support platform and name server registration to the fabric for CHPID types FC and FCP. Information about the channels that are connected to a fabric (if registered) allows other nodes or storage area network (SAN) managers to query the",
