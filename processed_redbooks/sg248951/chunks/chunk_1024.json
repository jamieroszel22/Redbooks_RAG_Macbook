  "content": "(NTP) or PTP as ETS server with PPS maintains an accuracy of 10 ms. \u2013 An STP that uses ETS without PPS maintains accuracy of 100 ms. \u0002 The IBM z16 cannot be in the same CTN with z13, z12s, or earlier systems and cannot become member of a mixed CTN. \u0002 The Primary Time Server and the Backup Time Server must be IBM z16 to use the failover mechanism that is triggered by the n-mode STP Imminent Disruption Signal option. An STP-only CTN can be managed by using different HMCs. However, the HMC must be at the same driver level (or later) than any SE that is to be managed. Also, all SEs to be managed must be known (defined) to that HMC.In a STP-only CTN, the HMC can be used to perform the following tasks: \u0002 Start or modify the CTN ID. \u0002 Start the time (manually or by contacting an NTP server). \u0002 Start the time zone offset, Daylight Saving Time offset, and leap second offset. \u0002 Assign the roles of preferred, backup, and current time servers, and arbiter. \u0002 Adjust time by up to plus or minus 60",
