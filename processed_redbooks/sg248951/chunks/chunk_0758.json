The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-10 on page 263. z/OS Data Set Encryption Aligned with IBM Z Pervasive Encryption initiative, IBM provides application-transparent, policy-controlled dataset encryption in IBM z/OS. Policy-driven z/OS Data Set Encryption enables users to perform the following tasks: \u0002 De-couple encryption from data classification; encrypt data automatically independent of labor-intensive data classification work. \u0002 Encrypt data immediately and efficiently at the time that it is written. \u0002 Reduce risks that are associated with mis-classified or undiscovered sensitive data. \u0002 Help protect digital assets automatically. \u0002 Achieve application transparent encryption. IBM Db2 for z/OS and IBM Information Management System (IMS) intend to use z/OS Data Set Encryption. With z/OS, Data Set Encryption DFSMS enhances data security with support for",
