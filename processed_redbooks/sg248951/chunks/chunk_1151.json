Figure D-6 Flexible Capacity activated record Transferring capacity After the set up is complete, it is possible to transfer capacity and workload from Site A to Site B. This process can be automated by using GDPS technology. GCP (general-purpose processor) capacity is transferred by using licensed MIPS. However, you cannot activate half a CP. Therefore, it is the customer\u2019s responsibility to stay under the licensed amount of MIPS; otherwise, extra charges are incurred for the use that is greater than the licensed MIPS. Appendix D. Tailored Fit Pricing and IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency 523 After the Flexible Capacity record is active on both sites, a time limit of 24 hours begins in which workloads can be transferred from Site A to Site B without leading to more charges. During this time window, Flexible",
