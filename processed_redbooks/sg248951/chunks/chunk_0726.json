  "content": "supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259. HiperSockets support of IPV6 IPv6 is a key element in the future of networking. The IPv6 support for HiperSockets allows compatible implementations between external networks and internal HiperSockets networks. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. HiperSockets Layer 2 support For flexible and efficient data transfer for IP and non-IP workloads, the HiperSockets internal networks on IBM Z servers can support two transport modes: Layer 2 (Link Layer) and the current Layer 3 (Network or IP Layer). Traffic can be Internet Protocol (IP) Version 4 or Version 6 (IPv4, IPv6) or non-IP (AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA). HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device features its own Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) address. This MAC address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of Layer 2",
