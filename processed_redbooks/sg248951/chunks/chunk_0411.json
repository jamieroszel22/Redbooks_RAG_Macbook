The IBM Z servers now support dynamic routing in the SAN with the FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR) feature. It is designed to support the dynamic routing policies that are provided by the FICON director manufacturers; for example, Brocade\u2019s exchange-based routing (EBR) and Cisco\u2019s originator exchange ID (OxID)8 routing. A static SAN routing policy normally assigns the ISL routes according to the incoming port and its destination domain (port-based routing), or the source and destination ports pairing (device-based routing). The port-based routing (PBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d when a port starts a",
