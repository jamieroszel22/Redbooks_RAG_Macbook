Run the TKE Workstation Setup wizard. TKE upgrade considerations The TKE LIC does not need to be upgraded if you are migrating your configuration with Crypto Express6S and TKE Release 9.x to an IBM z16. For more information about TKE hardware support, see Table 6-3. For some functions, requirements must be considered; for example, the characterization of a Crypto Express adapter in EP 11 mode always requires the use of a TKE. Table 6-3 TKE Compatibility Matrix Note: If your IBM z16 includes Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S, you can use TKE V9.2, which requires the 4768 cryptographic adapter.
