Thin Interrupt support is available since zEC12/zBC12, and proved to be efficient and performant in numerous different test and customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations. For CFCC running on IBM z15, DYNDISP=THIN is now the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors. \u0002 CF monopolization avoidance With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher monitors in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a specific structure on a structure by structure basis. 136 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide When the number of CF tasks that are used by any structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks is also exceeded, the structure is considered to be \u201cmonopolizing\u201d the CF, and z/OS is informed of this monopolization. New support in z/OS observes the monopolization state for a structure, and starts to",
