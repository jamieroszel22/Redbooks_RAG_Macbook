Central processor complex design 135 \u0002 Message Path SYID Resiliency Enhancement When a z/OS system IPLs, message paths are supposed to be deactivated by using system reset, and their SYIDs are supposed to be cleared in the process. During the IPL, z/OS then reactivates the message paths with a new SYID that represents the new instance of z/OS that uses the paths. On rare occasions, a message path might not be deactivated during system reset or IPL processing, which leaves the message path active with the z/OS image\u2019s OLD, now-obsolete SYID. Because the path erroneously remained active, z/OS does not see any need to reactivate it with a new, correct SYID. From the perspective of the CF, the incorrect SYID persists and prevents delivery of signals to the z/OS image that",
