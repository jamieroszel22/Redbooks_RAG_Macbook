With IBM z16, support is added for BPCII v2/HWIREST APIs. \u0002 Crypto and OSA automatic toggling In rare cases after a microcode update, the Crypto and OSA adapters must be configured off/on to activate the loaded firmware. With IBM z16, a new function is available with which you can select one or more Crypto and OSA adapters and perform an automated serialized update of each card. The Figure 10-11 and Figure 10-12 on page 418 show examples of the automatic firmware activation for Crypto and OSA adapters. Figure 10-11 Crypto and OSA adapters selected for Update Firmware Important: Configuring the off/on operation is concurrent to the operating system activities only if the Crypto and OSA adapters are configured redundantly.",
