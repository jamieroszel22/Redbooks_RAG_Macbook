The structure of the IBM z16 is designed with the following goals: \u0002 Enhanced system modularity \u0002 Standardization to enable rapid integration \u0002 Platform simplification Cables are keyed to ensure that correct lengths are plugged. Plug detection ensures correct location, and custom latches ensure retention. Further improvements to the fabric bus include symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) cables that connect the drawers. To improve field-replaceable unit (FRU) isolation, advanced continuity checking techniques are applied to the SMP cables (Concurrent Cable Repair), with the new SMP cable plugging and unplugging tool. The thermal RAS design also was improved for the field-replaceable water manifold for PU cooling. The IBM z16 includes the following characteristics: \u0002 Processing infrastructure is designed by using drawer technology. \u0002 Keyed cables and plugging detection. \u0002 SMP cables that are used for fabric bus connections. \u0002 Master-master",
