Customers can benefit from the integrated AI accelerator by adding AI operations that are used to perform fraud prevention and fraud detection, customer behavior predictions, and supply chain operations. All of these operations are done in real time and fully integrated in transactional workloads. As a result, valuable insights are gained from their data instantly. The integrated accelerator for AI delivers AI inference in real time, at large scale, and high throughput rate, with no transaction left behind. The AI capability applies directly to the running transaction. It shifts the traditional paradigm of applying AI to the transactions that were completed. This innovative technology also can be used for intelligent IT workloads placement algorithms, which contributes to the better overall system performance. The Telum processor",
