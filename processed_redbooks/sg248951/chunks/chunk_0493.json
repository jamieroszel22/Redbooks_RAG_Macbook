A one-digit number ID starting from 0 (CSSID) is assigned to an LCSS, and a one-digit hexadecimal ID (MIF ID) starting from 0 is assigned to an LPAR within the LCSS. Subchannels A subchannel provides the logical appearance of a device to the program and contains the information that is required for sustaining a single I/O operation. Each device is accessible by using one subchannel in a channel subsystem to which it is assigned according to the active IOCDS of the IBM Z server. A subchannel set (SS) is a collection of subchannels within a channel subsystem. The maximum number of subchannels of a subchannel set determines how many devices are accessible to a channel subsystem. In z/Architecture, the first subchannel set of an LCSS can have 63.75 K subchannels (with 0.25 K reserved), with a subchannel set ID (SSID) of 0. By enabling the multiple subchannel sets, extra subchannel sets are available to increase the device",
