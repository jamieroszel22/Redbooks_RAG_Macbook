  "content": "capacities. For z/OS studies, the capacity scaling factor that is commonly associated with the reference processor is set to a 2094-701 with a Processor Capacity Index (PCI) value of 593. This value is unchanged since z/OS V1R11 LSPR. The use of the same scaling factor across LSPR releases minimizes the changes in capacity results for an older study and provides more accurate capacity view for a new study. Performance data for IBM z16 servers were obtained with z/OS V2R4 (running Db2 for z/OS V12, CICS TS V5R3, IMS V14, Enterprise COBOL V6R2, and WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V9.0.0.8). All IBM Z server generations are measured in the same environment with the same workloads at high usage. On average, IBM z16 servers can deliver up to 17% more performance in a 200-way configuration than an IBM z15 190 -way. However, the observed performance increase varies depending on the workload type. Consult the LSPR when you consider performance on the IBM z16. The range of performance",
