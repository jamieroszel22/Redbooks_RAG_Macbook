The extra storage capacity for an LPAR upgrade can come from the following sources: \u0002 Any unused available storage \u0002 Another partition that features released storage \u0002 A memory upgrade A concurrent LPAR storage upgrade uses DSR. z/OS uses the reconfigurable storage unit (RSU) definition to add or remove storage units in a nondisruptive way. z/VM V7R1 and later releases support the dynamic addition of memory to a running LPAR by using reserved storage. It also virtualizes this support to its guests. In z/VM 7.1, removing storage from the z/VM LPAR is disruptive. Removing memory from a z/VM guest is not disruptive to the z/VM LPAR. z/VM V7R2 and later also support Dynamic Memory Downgrade (DMD), which allows the removal of up to 50% of the real storage from a running z/VM system. SLES 11 and later supports concurrent add and remove. Chapter 3. Central processor complex",
