The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation support allows a port group of OSA-Express features to span multiple virtual switches within a single z/VM system or between multiple z/VM systems. Sharing a Link Aggregation Port Group (LAG) with multiple virtual switches increases optimization and use of the OSA-Express features when handling larger traffic loads. Higher adapter use protects customer investments, which is increasingly important as 10 GbE deployments become more prevalent. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. Large send for IPv6 packets Large send for IPv6 packets improves performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express feature by using a more",
