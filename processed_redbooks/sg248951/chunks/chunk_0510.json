All rights reserved. 209 Chapter 6. Cryptographic features This chapter describes the hardware cryptographic functions that are available on IBM z16. The CP Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF), together with the IBM Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cryptographic coprocessors (PCIeCC), offer a balanced use of processing resources and unmatched scalability for fulfilling pervasive encryption demands. This chapter also introduces the principles of cryptography and describes the implementation of cryptography in the hardware and software architecture of IBM Z. It also describes the features that IBM z16 offers. Finally, the cryptographic features and required software are summarized. This chapter",
