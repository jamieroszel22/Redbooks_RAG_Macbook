CCA 8.0 The following CCA 8.0 improvements were made: \u0002 Performance enhancement for mixed workloads: better performance when one partition focuses on RSA/ECC and another partition focuses on AES/DES/TDES or financial operations \u0002 Hardware accelerated key unwrap for AES wrapped keys \u2013 Trusted Key Entry workstation (TKE) controlled selection of WRAPENH3 as the default TDES key token wrapping method for easier management. CCA 7.2 and CCA 6.5 The following CCA 7.2 and 6.5 improvements were made: \u0002 AES DUKPT unique key per transaction for AES-based PIN and transaction protection \u0002 ISO 4 enhanced support for adding AES protected PIN block support to all remaining services that",
