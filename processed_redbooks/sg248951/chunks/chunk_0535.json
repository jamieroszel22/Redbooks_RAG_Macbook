  "content": "algorithms that use secret keys. However, the coprocessor can be used for cryptographic algorithms that use clear keys or protected keys. The CPACF works synchronously with the PU, which means that the owning processor is busy when its coprocessor is busy. This setup provides a fast device for cryptographic services. 220 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide CPACF supports pervasive encryption. Simple policy controls allow businesses to enable encryption to protect data in mission-critical databases without the need to stop the database or re-create database objects. Pervasive encryption includes z/OS Dataset Encryption, z/OS Coupling Facility Encryption, z/VM encrypted hypervisor paging, and z/TPF transparent database encryption, which use performance enhancements in the hardware. The CPACF offers a set of symmetric cryptographic functions that enhances the encryption and decryption performance of clear key operations. These functions are for SSL, virtual private network (VPN), and",
