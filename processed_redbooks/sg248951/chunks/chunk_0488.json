The features are assigned to one of the four resource groups (RGs) that are running on the IFP according to their physical location in the PCIe+ I/O drawer, which provides management functions and virtualization functions. If two features of the same type are installed, one always is managed by resource group 1 (RG 1) or resource group 3 (RG3); the other feature is managed by resource group 2 (RG 2) or resource group 4 (RG 4). This configuration provides redundancy if one of the features or resource groups needs maintenance or fails. The IFP and RGs support the following infrastructure management functions: \u0002 Firmware update of adapters and resource groups \u0002 Error recovery and failure data collection",
