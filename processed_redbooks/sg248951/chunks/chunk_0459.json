  "content": "image. ISM is defined by the FUNCTION statement with a virtual CHPID (VCHID) in HCD/IOCDS. Identified by the PNETID parameter, each ISM VCHID defines an isolated, internal virtual network for SMC-D communication, without any hardware component required. Virtual adapters are defined by virtual function (VF) statements. Multiple LPARs can access the same virtual network for SMC-D data exchange by associating their VF with same VCHID. Applications that use HiperSockets can realize network latency and CPU reduction benefits and performance improvement by using the SMC-D over ISM. IBM z16 servers support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a total maximum of 8,000 VFs. Shared Memory Communications Version 2 Shared Memory Communications v2 is available in z/OS V2R4 (with PTFs) and z/OS V2R5. The initial version of SMC was limited to TCP/IP connections over the same layer 2 network; therefore, it was not routable across multiple IP subnets. The associated",
