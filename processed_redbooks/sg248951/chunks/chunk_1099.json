  "content": "CPs Defined for an LPAR. \u0002 The server capacity declines relative to the LCP:RCP ratio (sum of logical CPs that is defined in all LPARs: the number of physical CPs on your configuration). Therefore, assigning the correct number of logical CPs to an LPAR is important. \u0002 Utilize IBM zPCR to size IBM Processors. (Don\u2019t use MIPS tables to do capacity sizing). \u0002 Design your LPARs to \u201cfit\u201d in a single drawer with room to grow. \u2013 When the number of logicals exceeds the drawer boundary all physics come into play, slowing down, and that CPU time is clocked to your applications and to your bill. \u0002 For the larger partitions, start the strategy to split them into smaller partitions. \u2013 Use IBM zPCR to show potential capacity savings for \u201cmore smaller\u201d LPARs. \u0002 Utilize HiperDispatch in every z/OS and z/VM LPAR. HiperDispatch optimizes processor cache usage by creating an affinity between a PU and the workload. 12.9.5 IBM zPCR HiperDispatch Report IBM zPCR HiperDispatch report supports the ability to",
