Only Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR) features are supported on IBM z16. Chapter 4. Central processor complex I/O structure 189 The coupling link options are listed in Table 4-10. Also listed is the coupling link support for each IBM Z platform. Restrictions on the maximum numbers can apply, depending on the configuration. Always check with your IBM support team for more information. Table 4-10 Coupling link options that are supported on IBM z16 The maximum number of combined external coupling links (active CE LR, ICA SR links) is 160 per IBM z16 A01 system. IBM z16 systems support up to 384 coupling CHPIDs per CPC. An IBM z16 coupling link support summary is shown in Table 4-10. Consider the following points: \u0002 The maximum supported links depends on the IBM Z model or",
