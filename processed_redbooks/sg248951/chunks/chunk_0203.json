The IBM z16 A01 cache hierarchy is shown in Figure 3-3. Figure 3-3 IBM z16 cache levels and memory hierarchy On IBM z16, L1 and L2 caches are implemented on the PU chip, and L3 and L4 caches are now implemented as virtual caches and dynamically allocated on the shared part of the L2 semi-private cache. The cache structure of the IBM z16 features the following characteristics: \u0002 Large L1, L2 caches (more data closer to the core). \u0002 L1 cache is implemented by using SRAM technology and has the same size than on IBM z15 (128 KB for instructions and 128 KB for data). \u0002 L2 cache (32 MB in total) uses SRAM technology, and is semi-private to each PU core with 16 MB dedicated to the associated core, and 16 MB shared with the system (the 50/50 split is adjustable). \u0002 L3 cache (up to 256 LB) now becomes a virtual cache and can be allocated on any of the share",
