Remote cache accesses may take hundreds of machine cycles. SMF 99.14 records are produced every 5 minutes and capture drawer/DCM/chip location data for each logical CP. In the Topology Reports, IBM zPCR reports \u201cmeasured\u201d data and it shows the \u201cwhat-is\u201d and not the \u201cwhat-if\u201d topology scenarios. 12.9.7 IBM z16 HMC - View Partition Resource Assignments Note: To access HMC",
