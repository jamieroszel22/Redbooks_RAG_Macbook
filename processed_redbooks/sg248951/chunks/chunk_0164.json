To prevent connectivity loss, the redundant I/O interconnect feature allows you to maintain connection to critical I/O devices installed in PCIe+I/O Drawers when a CPC drawer is removed. ICA SR1.1 (and ICA SR) can also be installed for coupling and timing links redundancy. 2.7.1 Redundant I/O interconnect Redundancy is provided for PCIe I/O interconnects. The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports up to 16 PCIe features, which are organized in two hardware domains (for each drawer). The infrastructure for the fan-out to I/O drawers and external coupling is shown in Figure 2-23. Figure 2-23 Infrastructure for PCIe+ I/O drawer (system with two PCIe+ I/O drawers) The PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out cards are used to provide the connection from the PU DCM PCIe Bridge Unit (PBU), which uses split the PCIe Gen4 (@32GBps) processor busses into two PCIe Gen3 x16 (@16 GBps) interfaces to the PCIe switch card in the PCIe+ I/O drawer.
