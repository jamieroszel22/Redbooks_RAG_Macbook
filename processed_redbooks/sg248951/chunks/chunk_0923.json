  "content": "Channel Links with degrading signal strength before errors start to occur. The new Fibre Channel Extended Link Service (ELS) retrieves signal strength. \u0002 FICON Dynamic Routing FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR) enables the use of storage area network (SAN) dynamic routing policies in the fabric. With the IBM z16, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static routing policies for inter-switch links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors. FICON Dynamic Routing dynamically changes the routing between the channel and control unit that is based on the Fibre Channel Exchange ID. Each I/O operation has a unique exchange ID. FIDR supports static SAN routing policies and dynamic routing policies. FICON Dynamic Routing can help clients reduce costs by providing the following features: \u2013 Share SANs between their FICON and FCP traffic. \u2013 Improve performance because of SAN dynamic routing policies that better use all of the available ISL bandwidth through higher use of the ISLs, \u2013 Simplify",
