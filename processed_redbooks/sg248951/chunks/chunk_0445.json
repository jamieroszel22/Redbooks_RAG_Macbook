  "content": "virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID). The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. Point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class 25 GbE switch are supported. 25 GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0453) 25 GbE RoCE Express3 LR(FC 0453) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and is supported on IBM z16 servers only. The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 LR is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID. It s defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD). The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 10 km (6.2 miles). A client-supplied cable is required. \u0002 A Single-mode (SM) 9-micron fiber optic cable is required for connecting the port to the selected 25 GbE",
