  "content": "Dispatching (DYNDISP) models: \u2013 DYNDISP=OFF: LPAR time-slicing completely controls the CF processor. The processor polls the entire time that it is dispatched by LPAR, and it is idle (not dispatched) when undispatched by LPAR. The result is least efficient sharing, worst shared-engine performance. \u2013 DYNDISP=ON: An optimization over pure LPAR time slicing, in which the CFCC code judiciously sets timer interrupts to give LPAR the initiative to redispatch it, and the CF sometimes voluntarily gives up control of the shared processor when it runs out of work to do. The result is more efficient sharing and better shared-engine performance. This setting is the default setting for CF LPAR running on IBM z15. \u2013 DYNDISP=THIN: An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts and runs until it runs out of things to do and then, gives up control voluntarily (until the next interrupt causes it to get dispatched again).",
