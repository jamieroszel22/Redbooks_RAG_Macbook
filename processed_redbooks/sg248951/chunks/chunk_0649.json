  "content": "provide more physical zIIPs for an IPL or Shutdown Boost. \u0002 To dynamically modify LPAR weights, as might be needed to modify sharing physical zIIP capacity during a Boost period. \u0002 To drive the invocation of the PROC that indicates the beginning of a shutdown process (and the start of the shut-down Boost). \u0002 To take advantage of new composite hardware API reconfiguration actions. \u0002 To control the level of parallelism that is present in the workload at startup (for example, starting middleware regions) and shutdown (for example, performing an orderly shutdown of middleware). Simultaneous multithreading SMT is the hardware capability to process up to two simultaneous threads in a single core, which shares the resources of the core, such as cache, translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and execution resources. This sharing improves system capacity and efficiency by reducing processor delays, which increases the overall throughput of the system. SMT5 is supported for zIIPs and IFLs. Boost",
