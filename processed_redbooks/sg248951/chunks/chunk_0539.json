This configuration holds the PU processing of the instruction flow until the operation completes. IBM z16 offers the following synchronous functions: \u0002 Data encryption and decryption algorithms for data privacy and confidentially: \u2013 Data Encryption Standard (DES): \u2022 Single-length key DES \u2022 Double-length key DES \u2022 Triple-length key DES (also known as Triple-DES) \u2013 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit keys \u0002 Hashing algorithms for data integrity, such as SHA-1 and SHA-2. New for IBM z14 ZR1 is SHA-3 support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 and the two extendable output functions as described by the standard SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256. \u0002 Message authentication code (MAC): \u2013 Single-length key MAC \u2013 Double-length key MAC 222 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide \u0002 Pseudo-Random Number Generator",
