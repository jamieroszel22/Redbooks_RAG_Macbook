Temporary upgrades The IBM z16 A01 base model describes permanent and dormant capacity by using the capacity marker and the number of PU features that are installed on the system. Up to eight temporary offerings can be present. Each offering includes its own policies and controls, and each can be activated or deactivated independently in any sequence and combination. Although multiple offerings can be active at any time, only one On/Off CoD offering can be active at any time if enough resources are available to fulfill the offering specifications. Temporary upgrades are represented in the system by a record. All temporary upgrade records are on the SE hard disk drive (HDD). The records can be downloaded from the RSF or installed from portable media. At the time of activation, you can control everything locally. 338 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide The provisioning architecture is shown in Figure 8-1. Figure 8-1 Provisioning",
