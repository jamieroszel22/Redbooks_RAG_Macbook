It is not affected by changes to the logical or physical configuration of the system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs. The Change LPAR Controls and Customize Activation Profiles tasks on the HMC were enhanced to support this new function. Tip: z/VM V7R1 and later also support HiperDispatch. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 119 For the z/OS Workload License Charges (WLC) pricing metric and metrics that are based on it, such as Advanced Workload License Charges (AWLC), an LPAR defined capacity can be set.
