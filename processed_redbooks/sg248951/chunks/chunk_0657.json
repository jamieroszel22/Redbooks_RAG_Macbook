  "content": "IBM z16 is equipped with a set of instructions to improve the performance of complex mathematical models and analytic workloads through vector processing and complex instructions, which can process numerous data with a single instruction. This set of instructions, which is known as SIMD, enables more consolidation of analytic workloads and business transactions on IBM Z servers. SIMD on IBM z16 has support for enhanced math libraries that provide performance improvements for analytical workloads by processing more information with a single CPU instruction. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. Operating System support includes the following features6: \u0002 Enablement of vector registers. \u0002 A math library with an optimized and tuned math function (Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem [MASS]) that can be used in place of some of the C standard math functions. It includes a SIMD vectorized and nonvectorized version. \u0002 A specialized",
