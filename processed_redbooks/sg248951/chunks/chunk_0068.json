  "content": "Guide 1.1 IBM z16 A01 highlights Each new IBM Z platform continues to deliver innovative technologies. The IBM z16 is no exception. It has a new processor chip design with each processor unit (PU) running at 5.2 GHz. IBM 16 provides 17% more processor capacity per CPC drawer compared to the IBM z15. The new processor chip design has a new cache hierarchy, on-chip AI accelerator that is shared by the PU cores, transparent memory encryption, and increased uniprocessor capacity (single thread and SMT similar). The on-chip AI scoring logic provides submicrosecond AI inferencing for deep learning and complex neural network models. The redesigned cache structure features the following cache sizes: \u0002 256 KB L1 per PU core \u0002 32 MB semi-private L2 per PU core \u0002 256 MB (logical) shared victim virtual L3 per chip \u0002 2 GB (logical) shared victim virtual L4 per CPC drawer The result is improved system performance and scalability with 1.5x more cache capacity per core over the IBM z15 and reduced",
