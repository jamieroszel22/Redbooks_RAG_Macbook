A port on an I/O feature card features a unique physical channel identifier (PCHID) according to the physical location of this I/O feature adapter, and the sequence of this port on the adapter. In addition, a port on a fan-out adapter has a unique adapter identifier (AID), according to the physical location of this fan-out adapter, and the sequence of this port on the adapter. A CHPID is assigned to a physical port by defining the corresponding PCHID or AID in the I/O configuration definitions. Control units A control unit provides the logical capabilities that are necessary to operate and control an I/O device. It adapts the characteristics of each device so that it can respond to the standard form of control that is provided by the CSS. A control unit can be housed separately or can be physically and",
