  "content": "fabric login (FLOGI) to a destination domain. The ISL is round-robin that is selected for assignment. Therefore, I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination domain always is assigned the same ISL route, regardless of the destination port of each I/O. This setup can result in some ISLs becoming overloaded while some are under-used. The ISL routing table is changed whenever IBM Z server undergoes a power-on-reset (POR), so the ISL assignment is unpredictable. Device-based routing (DBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on a hash of the source and destination port. That I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination is assigned to same ISL route. Compared to PBR, the DBR is more capable of spreading the load across ISLs for I/O flow from the same incoming port to different destination ports within a destination domain. When a static SAN routing policy is used, the FICON director features limited capability to assign ISL routes that are based on workload. This",
