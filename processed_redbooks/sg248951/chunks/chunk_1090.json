  "content": "determine workload type. When available, this data allows the RNI for a production workload to be calculated. By using the RNI and another factor from CPU MF, the L1MP (Level 1 Miss Per 100 instructions or percentage of data and instruction references that miss the L1 cache), a workload can be classified as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH RNI. This classification and resulting hit are automated in the IBM zPCR tool. It is preferable to use IBM zPCR for capacity sizing. Refer to Table 12-1 for the LSPR Workload Decision Table, based in L1MP and RNI. Table 12-1 L1MP and RNI-based LSPR Workload Decision Table Chapter 12. Performance and capacity planning 483 Starting with z/OS V2R1 with APAR OA43366, zFS file is no longer required for CPU MF and Hardware Instrumentation Services (HIS). HIS is a z/OS function that collects hardware event data for processors in SMF records type 113, and a z/OS UNIX System Services output files. Only SMF 113 record is required to know proper workload type by using",
