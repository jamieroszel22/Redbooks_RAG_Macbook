The overall goal of z/OS anti-monopolization support is to protect the ability of ALL well-behaved structures and workloads to access the CF, and get their requests processed in the CF in a timely fashion. At the same time, it implements queuing and throttling mechanisms in z/OS to hold back the specific abusive workloads that are causing problems for other workloads. z/OS XCF/XES use of APAR support is required to provide this function. \u0002 CFCC Change Shared-Engine CF Default to DYNDISP=THIN Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors.
