  "content": "The IOCDS is loaded into the hardware system area (HSA) during a central processor complex (CPC) power-on reset (POR) to start all of the channel subsystems. On IBM z16 A01 systems, the HSA is pre-allocated in memory with a fixed size of 256 GB, which is in addition to the customer purchased memory. This fixed size memory for HSA eliminates the requirement for more planning of the initial I/O configuration and planning for future I/O expansions. The following objects are always reserved in the IBM z16 A01 HSA during POR, whether they are defined in the IOCDS for use: CPC drawer repair: The HSA can be moved from one CPC drawer to a different drawer in an enhanced availability configuration as part of a concurrent CPC drawer repair (CDR) action.
