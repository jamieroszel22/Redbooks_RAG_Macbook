Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully. Chapter 2. Central processor complex hardware components 61 The frame count rules (number of frames) for IBM z16 A01 are listed in Table 2-14. Table 2-14 Frame count rules for IBM z16 A01 The number of CPC drawers and I/O drawers determines the number of racks in the system and the number of PDUs in the system. The PDU/line cord rules (number of PDU/Cord pairs) for IBM z16 A01 are listed in Table 2-15.
