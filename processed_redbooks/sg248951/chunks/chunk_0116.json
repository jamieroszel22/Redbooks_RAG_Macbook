Each pair of SMP9 ports is redundant. If a single cable fails, the repair can be performed concurrently. The CPC drawer logical structure, component connections are shown in Figure 2-9. Figure 2-9 CPC drawer logical structure Memory is connected to the DCMs through memory control units (MCUs). Up to six MCUs are available in a CPC drawer (one or two per DCM) and provide the interface to the DIMM controller. A memory controller uses eight DIMM slots. The buses are organized in the following configurations: \u0002 The M-bus provides interconnects between PU chips in the same DCM \u0002 The X-bus provides interconnects between PU chips to each other, in the same drawer \u0002 The A-bus provides interconnects between different drawers by using SMP9 cables 26 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 2.2.1 CPC drawer interconnect topology",
