Hardware Consumption Model IBM introduced a hardware solution that provides added flexibility to the IBM Z IT infrastructure pricing and is a natural and valuable extension to the Tailored Fit Pricing models for IBM Z software.

This always on corridor of consumption-priced capacity helps alleviate the effect of short unpredictable spikes in workload that are becoming more common in today\u2019s digital world. The use charges feature a granularity of 1 hour and are based on MSUs that are used as measured by the subcapacity reporting Tool (SCRT), not full engine capacity.

The presence of the always on capacity contributes to better efficiency, reduced overhead, and shorter response times. This offering",
