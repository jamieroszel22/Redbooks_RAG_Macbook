The eight cores and L2 caches on the chip communicate through bidirectional high-speed on-chip ring and with all SMP, I/O, and memory interfaces (see Figure 9-2 on page 381). Chapter 9. Reliability, availability, and serviceability 381 Figure 9-2 PU chip structure (with bidirectional ring shown) \u0002 Two PU chips are packaged on a dual chip module (DCM), as shown in Figure 9-3. PU chip to PU chip communication is performed through the M-Bus, which is a high-speed bus that acts as ring-to-ring extension communication at 160 Gbps data rate, with the following RAS characteristics: \u2013 ECC on data path and snoop bus \u2013 Parity on miscellaneous control lines \u2013 One spare per ~50 data bit bus Figure 9-3 IBM z16 Dual Chip Module (M-Bus connects the two chips) 382 IBM z16 (3931)",
