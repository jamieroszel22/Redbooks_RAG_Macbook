Use the results as input in the planning stage to help identify critical resources. With this planning information, you can examine the LPAR configuration and workload priorities to determine how resources might be reduced and still allow the drawer to be concurrently removed. Exception: Single-drawer systems cannot use the EDA procedure. 396 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Include the following tasks in the planning process: \u0002 Review of the IBM z16 configuration to determine the following values: \u2013 Number of drawers that are installed and the number of PUs enabled. Consider the following points: \u2022 Use the Resource Link machine information or the HMA to determine the model, number, and types of PUs (CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs). \u2022 Determine the amount of memory (physically installed and LICCC-enabled). \u2022 Work",
