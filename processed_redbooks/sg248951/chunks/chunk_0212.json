This capability is known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT). An operating system with SMT support can be configured to dispatch work to a thread on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM and Linux on IBM Z) core in single thread or SMT mode so that HiperDispatch cache optimization can be considered. For more information about operating system support, see Chapter 7, \u201cOperating system support\u201d on page 247. SMT technology allows instructions from more than one thread to run in any pipeline stage at a time. SMT can handle up to four pending translations. Each thread has its own unique state information, such as Program Status Word (PSW) and registers. The simultaneous threads cannot necessarily run instructions instantly and must at times compete to use certain core resources that are",
