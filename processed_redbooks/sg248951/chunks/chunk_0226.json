  "content": "which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits: \u0002 Brand new concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest \u0002 Supports DEFLATE compliant compression/decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler \u0002 Low latency \u0002 High bandwidth \u0002 Problem state execution \u0002 Hardware/Firmware interlocks to ensure system responsiveness \u0002 Designed instruction \u0002 Run in millicode The On-Chip Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processors chip; therefore, it is available to all LPARs and guests. Moving the compression function from the I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly on L2 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O. Data compression is running in one of the two execution modes available: Synchronous mode or Asynchronous mode: \u0002 Synchronous execution occurs in problem states where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address",
