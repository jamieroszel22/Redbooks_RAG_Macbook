  "content": "instead. The data count in the CCW must equal the sum of the data counts in the MIDAWs. The CCW operation ends when the CCW count goes to zero or the last MIDAW (with the last flag) ends. The combination of the address and count in a MIDAW cannot cross a page boundary. Therefore, the largest possible count is 4 K. The maximum data count of all the MIDAWs in a list cannot exceed 64 K, which is the maximum count of the associated CCW. The scatter-read or scatter-write effect of the MIDAWs makes it possible to efficiently send small control blocks that are embedded in a disk record to separate buffers from those that are used for larger data areas within the record. MIDAW operations are on a single I/O block, in the manner of data chaining. Do not confuse this operation with CCW command chaining. Extended format data sets z/OS extended format (EF) data sets use internal structures (often not visible to the application program) that require a scatter-read (or scatter-write) operation.",
