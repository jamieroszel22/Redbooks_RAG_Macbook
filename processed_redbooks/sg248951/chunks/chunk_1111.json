The GP-02 partition and the \u201cNote\u201d at the bottom are shaded with the same violet color. Chapter 12. Performance and capacity planning 497 Figure 12-15 Estimated distribution of real CPs across drawers report IBM z16 continues the IBM z14 and IBM z15 NUMA9 design. IBM z16 has two clusters and four DCMs per drawer (refer to Table 12-2 on page 493 for the number of Configurable PUs per drawer). In the case where a single partition spans from one drawer into a second, the cross-drawer penalty has increased on IBM z16. However, this is offset by more",
