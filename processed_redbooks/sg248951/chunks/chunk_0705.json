When new controllers are added to an I/O configuration or changes are made to existing controllers, the system discovers them and proposes configuration changes that are based on that policy. Remember: The need for ICKDSF Release 17 also applies to systems that are not part of the same sysplex, or are running an operating system other than z/OS, such as z/VM. 294 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide zDAC provides real-time discovery for the FICON fabric, subsystem, and I/O device resource changes from z/OS. By exploring the discovered control units for defined logical control units (LCUs) and devices, zDAC compares the discovered controller information with the current system configuration. It then determines delta changes to the configuration for a proposed configuration. All added or changed logical control units and devices are added into the proposed configuration. They are assigned proposed control unit and device numbers, and channel paths that are based on the defined",
