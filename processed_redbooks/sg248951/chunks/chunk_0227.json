The On-Chip data compression implements compression as defined by RFC1951 (DEFLATE). Figure 3-12 shows the nest compression accelerator (NXU) for On-Chip Compression acceleration. Figure 3-12 Integrated Accelerator for zEDC (NXU) on the IBM z16 PU chip For more information about sizing, migration considerations, and software support, see Appendix C, \u201cIBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression\u201d on page 507. Coprocessor units (on-core) A data compression coprocessor and a cryptography coprocessor unit is available on each core in the IBM Telum chip. The compression engine uses static dictionary compression and",
