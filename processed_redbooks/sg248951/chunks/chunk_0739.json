The checksum offload function applies to packets that go to or come from the LAN. When multiple IP stacks share an OSA-Express, and an IP stack sends a packet to a next hop address that is owned by another IP stack that is sharing the OSA-Express, OSA-Express sends the IP packet directly to the other IP stack. The packet does not have to be placed out on the LAN, which is termed LPAR-to-LPAR traffic. Checksum",
