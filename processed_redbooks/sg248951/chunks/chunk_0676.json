  "content": "information and reactivates the path to correct the problem. \u0002 CF monopolization avoidance z/OS takes advantage of current CF support in CFLEVEL 24 (IBM z15 T01/T02) to deliver improved z/OS support for handling CF monopolization. With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher monitors in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a specific structure on a structure-by-structure basis. When the number of CF tasks that is used by any structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks also is exceeded, the structure is considered to be \u201cmonopolizing\u201d the CF. z/OS is informed of this monopolization. New support in z/OS observes the monopolization state for a structure, and starts to selectively queue and throttle incoming requests to the CF on a structure-specific basis. Other requests for other \u201cnon-monopolizing\u201d structures and workloads are unaffected. z/OS dynamically manages the queue of requests for the",
