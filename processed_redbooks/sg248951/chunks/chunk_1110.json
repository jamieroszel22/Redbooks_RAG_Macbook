When that happens, capacity growth by adding LCPs is very limited. The new notice appears as a \u201cNote\u201d message in the Partition Detail Report. The \u201cNote\u201d and the partition LCPs are shaded with the same violet color, as shown for partition IFL-01 in Figure 12-12 above and for partition GP-02 in Figure 12-14 on page 496. Chapter 12.
