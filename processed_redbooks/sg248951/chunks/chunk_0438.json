OSA-Express6S 10 Gigabit Ethernet LR (FC 0424) The OSA-Express6S 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) Long Reach (LR) feature includes one PCIe adapter and one port per feature. The port supports CHPID types OSD and OSX. The 10 GbE feature is designed to support attachment to a single-mode fiber 10 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 10 Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and can be shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express6S 10 GbE LR feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor LC",
