The amount of memory that can be enabled by the customer is the total physically installed memory minus the 256 GB of HSA memory. \u0002 A CPC drawer can have available unused memory, which can be ordered as a memory upgrade and enabled by LIC-CC concurrently without DIMM changes. \u0002 DIMM changes require a disruptive power-on reset (POR) on IBM z16 A01 with a single CPC drawer. DIMM changes can be done concurrently on IBM z16 models with multiple CPC drawers using Enhanced Drawer Availability (EDA). \u0002 CFG numbers from 32 to 35 are used on PDU machines only. \u0002 BPA machines have an upper limit of CFG number 31. DIMM plugging for the configurations in each CPC drawer do not have to be similar. Each memory 8-slot DIMM bank must have the same DIMM size; however, a drawer can have a mix of DIMM banks. The support element View Hardware Configuration task can be used to determine the size and quantity of the memory plugged in each drawer. Figure",
