Workload deployed in z/OS Container Extensions is zIIP eligible. How zIIPs work zIIPs are designed for supporting designated z/OS workloads. One of the workloads is Java code execution. When Java code must be run (for example, under control of IBM WebSphere), the z/OS JVM calls the function of the zIIP. The z/OS dispatcher then suspends the JVM task on the CP that it is running on and dispatches it on an available zIIP. After the Java application code execution is finished, z/OS redispatches the JVM task on an available CP. After this process occurs, normal processing is resumed. This process reduces the CP time that is needed to run Java WebSphere applications, which frees that capacity for other workloads. 6 IBM z Systems Application Assist Processors (zAAPs) are not available since IBM z14 servers. A zAAP workload is dispatched to available zIIPs (zAAP on",
