After VFPE is used to encrypt a credit card number, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications. VFPE allows customers to add encryption to their applications in such a way that the encrypted data can flow through their systems without requiring a massive redesign of their application. In our example, if the credit card number is VFPE-encrypted at the point of entry, the cipher text still behaves as a credit card number. It can flow through business logic until it meets a back-end transaction server that can VFPE-decrypt it to get the original credit card number to process the transaction.
