PU weighting Because CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, and ICFs have their own pools from where they are dispatched, they can be given their own weights. For more information about PU pools and processing weights, see the Processor Resource/Systems Manager Planning Guide, SB10-7178. 100 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide 3.5.2 Central processors A central processor (CP) is a PU that uses the full z/Architecture instruction set. It can run z/Architecture-based operating systems (z/OS, z/VM, TPF, z/TPF, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z) and the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). Up to 200 PUs can be characterized as CPs, depending on the configuration. The IBM z16 can be initialized in LPAR (PR/SM) mode or in Dynamic Partition Manger (DPM) mode. CPs are defined as dedicated or shared. Reserved CPs can be defined to an LPAR to allow for",
