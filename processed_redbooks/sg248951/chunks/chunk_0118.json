  "content": "Oscillator card With IBM z16 Model A01, the oscillator card design and signal distribution scheme are improved; however, the RAS strategy for redundant clock signal and dynamic switchover is unchanged. One primary OSC card and one backup are used. If the primary OSC card fails, the secondary detects the failure, takes over transparently, and continues to provide the clock signal to the CPC. Manage System Time HMC level 2.16.0 (Driver 51) is required to manage system time for IBM z16 Model A01. Network Time Protocol The SEs provide the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client function. When Server Time Protocol (STP) is used, the time of an STP-only Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) can be synchronized to the time that is provided by a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. This configuration allows time-of-day (TOD) synchronization in a heterogeneous platform environment and throughout the LPARs running on the CPC.
