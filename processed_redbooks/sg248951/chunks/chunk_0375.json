IBM z16 provides a supported capability to drive these same kinds of hardware-only changes from a driving z/OS HCD instance to a remote CPC which is not a standalone Coupling facility, but rather a CPC which hosts Linux on Z and /or z/TPF images. This new support is applicable only when both, the driving CPC and the target CPC are z16 with the required firmware support (Bundle S24 or higher) and the driving systems z/OS is at level 2.3 or higher with APAR OA65559. \u0002 Pluggable optics: \u2013 The following features include Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) optics2: \u2022 FICON Express32S \u2022 FICON Express16SA \u2022 FICON Express16S+ \u2022 OSA Express7S 1.2 \u2022 OSA Express7S (including OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR 1.1) \u2022 OSA Express6S, RoCE Express3 \u2022 RoCE Express2.1 \u2022 RoCE Express2 \u2022 RoCE Express These optics",
