The maximum number of characterizable processor units (PUs) with the IBM z16 is represented by feature names: Max39, Max82, Max125, Max168, and Max200. The number of characterizable PUs, spare PUs, System Assist Processors (SAPs), and Integrated Firmware Processors (IFP) are included with each IBM z16 feature (see Table 1-1). Table 1-1 IBM z16 A01 processor unit (PU) configurations The IBM z16 memory subsystem uses proven redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) technology to ensure high availability. Up to 40 TB (10 TB per CPC drawer) of addressable memory per system can be ordered. The IBM z16 also has unprecedented capacity to meet consolidation needs with innovative I/O features for transactional and hybrid cloud environments. The IBM z16 (maximum configuration) can support up to 12 PCIe+ I/O drawers. Each I/O drawer can support up to 16 I/O or special purpose features",
