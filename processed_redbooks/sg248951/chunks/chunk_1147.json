IBM\u2019s answer was the introduction of zDR Cloud. This offering enables active MIPS flexibility between the production site and the DR site. It also offers greater flexibility over CBU tests for length of test execution and frequency. However, the following disadvantages must be addressed: \u0002 zDR Cloud requires an MES to run a site swap for test and CBU for unplanned site swap \u0002 Onsite IBM intervention is required, which is not COVID-safe \u0002 A 2-week lead time is required to implement, which induces delays \u0002 it is applicable only to planned site swap scenarios; therefore, DR testing and real DR scenarios are not the same, which causes compliance issues \u0002 A lack of standardization",
