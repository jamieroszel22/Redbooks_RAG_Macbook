Depending on the quantity of the extra processors in the upgrade, more processor drawers might be required, and can be concurrently installed before the LICCC is enabled if plan-ahead features are available. With the sub-capacity models, capacity can be provided by adding CPs, changing the capacity identifier on the current CPs, or both. Upgrades: An MES provides the physical upgrade, which results in more enabled processors, different capacity settings for the CPs, and more memory, I/O ports, I/O adapters, and I/O drawers. Extra planning tasks are required for nondisruptive logical upgrades. For more information, see \u201cGuidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades\u201d on page 377. Limits: The sum of CPs, inactive CPs, ICFs, unassigned ICFs, zIIPs,",
