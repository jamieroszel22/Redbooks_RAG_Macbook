Each of the 117 subcapacity settings applies to up to 39 CPs only, independent of the model installed. 3.5.3 Integrated Facility for Linux (FC 1959) An IFL is a PU that can be used to run Linux, Linux guests on z/VM operating systems, and an IBM Secure Service Container (SSC). Up to 200 PUs can be characterized as IFLs, depending on the configuration. Note: Information about CPs in the remainder of this chapter applies to all CP capacity settings, unless indicated otherwise. For more information about granular capacity, see 2.3.3, \u201cPU characterization\u201d on page 33. Note: IFLs can be dedicated to a Linux, a z/VM, or an SSC LPAR, or can be shared by multiple Linux guests, z/VM LPARs, or SSC that are running on the same IBM z16 server. Only z/VM, Linux on IBM Z operating systems, SSC,",
