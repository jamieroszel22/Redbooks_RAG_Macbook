  "content": "Coupling Adapter (ICA SR and ICA SR 1.1) and the Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR). The Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand is not supported. \u2013 The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3, 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express2.1, and 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express2 provide high-speed memory-to-memory data exchange to a remote CPC by using the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) protocol for TCP (socket-based) communications. The RoCE Express3 features also can provide local area network (LAN) connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. Link performance: The link speeds do not represent the performance of the link. The performance depends on many factors, including latency through the adapters, cable lengths, and the type of workload. Note: Unless specified",
