By using the tool, data is formatted and displayed in the following views: \u0002 PCHID Control Unit View Shows PCHIDs, channel subsystems (CSS), CHPIDs, and their control units. \u0002 PCHID Partition View Shows PCHIDS, CSS, CHPIDs, and the partitions in which they exist. \u0002 Control Unit View Shows the control units, their PCHIDs, and their link addresses in each CSS. \u0002 Link",
