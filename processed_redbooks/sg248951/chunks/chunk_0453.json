The 10 GbE RoCE Express2.1 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. Point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class 10 GbE switch are supported. 25 GbE RoCE Express2 (FC 0430) 25 GbE RoCE Express2 (FC 0430) is installed in the PCIe I/O drawer and is supported on IBM z16 servers when carried forward. The 25 GbE RoCE Express2 is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID. It is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD). The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 100 meters (328 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 10 GbE switch or to another 10 GbE RoCE Express3 SR feature: \u0002 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex",
