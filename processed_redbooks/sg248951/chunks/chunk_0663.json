SMF 30 records were enhanced to include new crypto counter sections that contain counters for CPACF cryptographic instructions that are used by a job in a specific period. These sections are produced only for those instructions that are used. These counters are correlated with z/OS jobs and users for the determination of the algorithms, bit lengths, and key security that is used by a specific workload. This data can aid in compliance, performance, and configuration. The SMF 30 self-defining section indicates the length and number of crypto counter sections. The SMF 30 product and subsystem section indicates whether the crypto counters are active. This feature is supported on z/OS 2.4 and later. It requires APAR OA61511. Large page support In",
