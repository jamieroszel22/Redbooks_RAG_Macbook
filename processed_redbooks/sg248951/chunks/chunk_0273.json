In addition, to run the encryption processing, the zIIP also handles the cryptographic validation of message integrity and IPSec header processing. \u0002 z/OS Global Mirror, formerly known as Extended Remote Copy (XRC), also uses the zIIP. Most z/OS Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (DFSMS) system data mover (SDM) processing that is associated with z/OS Global Mirror can run on the zIIP. \u0002 The first IBM user of z/OS XML system services is Db2 V9. For Db2 V9 before the z/OS XML System Services enhancement, z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing was partially directed to zIIPs when used as part of a distributed Db2 request through DRDA. This enhancement benefits Db2 by making all z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing eligible to zIIPs. This configuration is possible when processing is used as part of any workload that is running in enclave SRB mode. \u0002 z/OS Communications Server also allows the HiperSockets Multiple Write",
