Figure 2-22 Fan out locations in the CPC drawer Up to 12 PCIe fan-outs (LG01 - LG12) can be installed in each CPC drawer. A fan-out can be repaired concurrently with the use of redundant I/O interconnect. For more information, see 2.7.1, \u201cRedundant I/O interconnect\u201d on page 52. The following types of fan-outs are available: \u0002 PCIe+ Generation 3 dual port fan-out card: This fan-out provides connectivity to the PCIe switch cards in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. \u0002 Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR1.1 and ICA SR): These adapters provide coupling connectivity to IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 servers. Important: The base System Recovery Boost capability is built into IBM z16 firmware and does not require ordering of extra features. For IBM z16 A01, System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 9930 + FC 6804) is an optional, orderable feature",
