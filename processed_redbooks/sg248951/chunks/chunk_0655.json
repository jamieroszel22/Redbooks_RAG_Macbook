The number of active threads per core can be changed dynamically without a system outage and potential capacity gains going from SMT-1 to SMT-2 (one to two threads per core) can be achieved dynamically. z/VM V7R3, V7R2, and V7R1 support up to 40 multithreaded cores (80 threads) for IFLs, and each thread is treated as an independent processor. z/VM dispatches virtual IFLs on the IFL logical processor so that the same or different guests can share a core. Each core has a single dispatch vector, and z/VM attempts to place virtual sibling IFLs on the same dispatch vector to maximize cache reuses. z/VM guests have no awareness of SMT, and cannot use it directly. z/VM SMT use does not include guest support for multithreading. The value of this support for guests is that the first-level z/VM host of the guests can achieve higher throughput from the multi-threaded IFL cores. Linux on IBM Z and the KVM hypervisor The Linux kernel features SMT functions that",
