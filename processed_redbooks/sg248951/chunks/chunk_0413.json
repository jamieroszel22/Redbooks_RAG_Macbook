  "content": "limitation can result in unbalanced use of ISLs (some might be overloaded, while others are under-used). The dynamic routing ISL routes are dynamically changed based on the Fibre Channel exchange ID, which is unique for each I/O operation. ISL is assigned at I/O request time; therefore, different I/Os from same incoming port to same destination port are assigned different ISLs. With FIDR, IBM z16 servers feature the following advantages for performance and management in configurations with ISL and cascaded FICON directors: \u0002 Support sharing of ISLs between FICON and FCP (PPRC or distributed) \u0002 I/O traffic is better balanced between all available ISLs \u0002 Improved use of FICON director and ISL \u0002 Easier to manage with a predicable and repeatable I/O performance FICON dynamic routing can be enabled by defining dynamic routing-capable switches and control units in HCD. Also, z/OS implemented a health check function for FICON dynamic routing. Improved zHPF I/O execution at distance By",
