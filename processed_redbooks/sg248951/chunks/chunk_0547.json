For more information, see 6.5.4, \u201cCrypto Express8S as an accelerator\u201d on page 235. These modes can be configured by using the SE. The PCIe adapter must be configured offline to change the mode. Attention: Switching between configuration modes erases all adapter secrets. The exception is when you are switching from Secure CCA to accelerator, and vice versa. Chapter 6. Cryptographic features 225 The Crypto Express8S feature is released for enhanced cryptographic performance. Customers who migrated to variable-length AES key tokens cannot take advantage of faster encryption speeds by using CPACF. Support is being added to translate a secure variable-length AES CIPHER token to a protected key token (protected by the system wrapping key). This support allows for faster AES encryption speeds when",
