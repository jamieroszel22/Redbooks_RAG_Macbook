When a Crypto Express8S feature is installed concurrently, the installation can select an out-of-sequence number from the unused range. When a Crypto Express8S (Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S) feature is removed concurrently, the PCIe adapter numbers are automatically freed. The definition of domain indexes and PCIe cryptographic adapter numbers in the candidate list for each LPAR must be planned to allow for nondisruptive changes. Consider the following points: \u0002 Operational changes can be made by using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task from the SE, which reflects the cryptographic definitions in the image profile for the partition. With this function, adding and removing the cryptographic feature without stopping a running",
