HiperDispatch on IBM z16 systems uses chip and CPC drawer configuration to improve the access cache performance. It optimizes the system PU allocation with Chip/cluster/drawer cache structure on IBM Z servers. The base support for IBM z16 is provided by PTFs that are identified by: IBM.device.server.IBM z16-3931.requiredservice PR/SM on IBM z16 servers preferentially assigns memory for a system in one CPC drawer that is striped across the clusters of that drawer to take advantage of the lower latency memory access in a drawer. Also, PR/SM tries to consolidate storage onto drawers with the most processor entitlement. With HiperDispatch enabled, PR/SM seeks to assign logical processors of a partition to the smallest number of PU chips within a drawer in cooperation with operating system to optimize shared",
