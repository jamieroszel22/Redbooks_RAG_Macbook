Remember: A virtual appliance that is deployed in a Secure Service Container runs in a dedicated LPAR. When activated, it reduces the maximum number of available LPARs by one. 268 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide z/OS can take advantage of this support and nondisruptively acquire and release memory from the reserved area. z/VM V7R1 and later can acquire memory nondisruptively and immediately make it available to guests. z/VM virtualizes this support to its guests, which now also can increase their memory nondisruptively if supported by the guest operating system. Currently, releasing memory from z/VM is supported on z/VM V7.2 with PTFs3. Releasing memory from the z/VM guest depends on the guest\u2019s operating system support. Linux on IBM Z also supports acquiring and releasing memory nondisruptively. This feature is enabled for SUSE Linux Enterprise",
