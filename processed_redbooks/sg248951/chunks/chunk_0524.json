  "content": "key algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms use complex calculations and are relatively slow (about 100 - 1000 times slower than symmetric algorithms). Therefore, such algorithms are not used for the encryption of bulk data. Because the private key is never exchanged between the parties in communication, they are less vulnerable than symmetric algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms mainly are used for authentication, digital signatures, and for the encryption and exchange of secret keys, which in turn are used to encrypt bulk data with a symmetric algorithm. Examples for asymmetric algorithms are RSA and the elliptic curve algorithms. \u0002 One-way algorithms are not cryptographic functions. They do not use keys, and they can scramble data only, not de-scramble it. These algorithms are used extensively within cryptographic procedures for digital signing and tend to be developed and governed by using the same principles as cryptographic algorithms. One-way algorithms are also known as hash",
