  "content": "Resource Director Intelligent Resource Director (IRD) is an IBM Z capability that is used only by z/OS. IRD is a function that optimizes processor and channel resource utilization across LPARs within a single IBM Z server. This feature extends the concept of goal-oriented resource management. It does so by grouping system images that are on the same IBM z16 or IBM Z servers that are running in LPAR mode (and in the same Parallel Sysplex) into an LPAR cluster. This configuration allows WLM to manage resources (processor and I/O) across the entire cluster of system images and not only in one single image. An LPAR cluster is shown in Figure 3-21. It contains three z/OS images and one Linux image that is managed by the cluster. Included as part of the entire Parallel Sysplex is another z/OS image and a CF image. In this example, the scope over which IRD has control is the defined LPAR cluster. Figure 3-21 IRD LPAR cluster example Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 129 IRD",
