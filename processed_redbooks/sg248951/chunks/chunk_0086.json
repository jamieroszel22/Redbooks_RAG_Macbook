In addition, OSA-Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. OSA-Express7S 1.2 features continue to support copper and fiber optic (single-mode and multimode) environments. HiperSockets IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the IBM Z platforms that supplies attachments to up to 32 high-speed virtual LANs, with minimal system and network overhead. HiperSockets is a function of the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). It provides LAN connectivity across multiple system images on the same IBM Z platform by performing memory-to-memory data transfers in a secure way. The HiperSockets function eliminates the use of I/O subsystem operations. It also eliminates having to traverse an external network connection to communicate between LPARs in the same IBM Z platform. In this way, HiperSockets can",
