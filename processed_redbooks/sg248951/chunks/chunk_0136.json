The CPC drawer memory topology of an IBM z16 is shown in Figure 2-20. Figure 2-20 CPC drawer memory topology at maximum configuration Consider the following points regarding the topology: \u0002 Six memory controllers populated per drawer, one per PU chip (two chips do not have their MCUs populated). \u0002 Each memory controller supports eight DIMM slots. \u0002 The eight DIMMs on a controller are all the same size. \u0002 Four, five, or six memory controllers per drawer are populated (32, 40, or 48 DIMMs). \u0002 Different memory controllers might have different size DIMMs. \u0002 Features with different DIMMs sizes can be mixed in the same drawer. \u0002 The eight DIMMs per MCU",
