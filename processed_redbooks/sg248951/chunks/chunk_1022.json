  "content": "the HMC feature longtime automated failover protection for various cases that can arise. New for IBM z16 because an integrated battery facility no long is available, support was added by the HMC to allow the customer to configure an option to monitor for n-mode power conditions (wall power or power cord loss). If detected, an automated failover occurs to the Backup Time Server (BTS). Manage System Time user interface controls are available to manage failback to the PTS when the full power state is restored. ETS direct connectivity to the IBM z16 CPC is provided for both supported ETS protocols: NTP and PTP. Statement of Direction: IBM z16 is planned to be the last server to support established CoD unique record type automation interfaces. For example, the older command HWMCA_ACTIVATE_CBU_COMMAND changed to HWMCA_ADD_CAPACITY_COMMAND. We suggest that you change your automation scripts now. For more information, see Capacity on-Demand User's Guide, SC28-7025. Important: The Sysplex Time",
