Figure 6-5 CPACF key wrapping for Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, and Crypto Express6S The key wrapping for Crypto Express8S is similar to Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S. The CPACF Wrapping Key and the Transport Key for use with Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S are in a protected area of the HSA that is not visible to operating systems or applications. If a Crypto ExpressxS coprocessor (CEX8C, CEX7C, or CEX6C) is available, a protected key can begin its life as a secure key. Otherwise, an application is responsible for creating or loading a clear key value and then, uses the PCKMO instruction to wrap the key. ICSF is not called by the application if the CEXxC is not available. A new segment in the profiles of the CSFKEYS class in IBM RACF\u00ae restricts which secure keys can be used as protected keys. By default, all secure keys are",
