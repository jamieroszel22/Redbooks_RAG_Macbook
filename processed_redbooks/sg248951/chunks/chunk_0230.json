IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort (on-core) Sorting data is a significant part of IBM Z workloads including batch workloads, database query processing, and utility processing. The amount of data that is stored and processed on IBM Z continues to grow at a high rate, which drives an ever-increasing sort workload. Introduced on IBM z15 was the sort accelerator that is known as the IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort (see Figure 3-13 on page 87). The SORTL hardware instruction that is implemented on each core is used by DFSORT and",
