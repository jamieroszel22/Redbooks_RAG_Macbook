Practically though, 128-bit security strength is very secure. Edwards curves are used for digitally signing documents and verifying those signatures. Edwards curves are less susceptible to side channel attacks when compared to Prime and Brainpool curves. \u0002 ECC Protected Keys Crypto Express8S and Crypto Express7S provide support in CCA",
