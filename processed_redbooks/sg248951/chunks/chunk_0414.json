  "content": "introducing the concept of pre-deposit writes, zHPF reduces the number of round trips of standard FCP I/Os to a single round trip. Originally, this benefit is limited to writes that are less than 64 KB. 8 Check with the switch provider for their support statement. Chapter 4. Central processor complex I/O structure 169 zHPF on IBM z14 and newer servers were enhanced to allow all large write operations (> 64 KB) at distances up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) to be run in a single round trip to the control unit. This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances. Read Diagnostic Parameter Extended Link Service support To improve the accuracy of identifying a failed component without unnecessarily replacing components in a SAN fabric, a new Extended Link Service (ELS) command called Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) was added to the Fibre Channel T11 standard. This command allows IBM Z servers to obtain extra diagnostic data from the SFP",
