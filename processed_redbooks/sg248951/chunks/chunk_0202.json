Figure 3-2 IBM z16 Dual Chip Module Concurrent maintenance allows dynamic central processing complex (CPAC) drawer add and repair.2 IBM z16 processors use 7 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography chip technology with advanced low latency pipeline design, which creates high-speed yet power-efficient circuit designs. The PU DCM has a dense packaging, which allows closed water loop cooling. The heat from the closed loop is dissipated into the air by a radiator unit (RU). 2 For configurations with two or more CPC drawers installed. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 73 The external water-cooling option is no longer available on the IBM z16.
