The alternative configuration is activated temporarily, and provides more capacity than the system\u2019s original, permanent configuration. At activation time, determine the capacity that you require for that situation. You can decide to activate only a subset of the capacity that is specified in the CBU contract. The base system configuration must have sufficient memory and channels to accommodate the potential requirements of the large CBU target system. Ensure that all required functions and resources are available on the backup systems. These functions include CF LEVELs for coupling facility partitions, memory, and cryptographic functions, and connectivity capabilities. When the emergency is over (or the CBU test is complete), the system must be returned to its original configuration. The CBU features can be deactivated at any time before the expiration date. Failure to deactivate the CBU feature before",
