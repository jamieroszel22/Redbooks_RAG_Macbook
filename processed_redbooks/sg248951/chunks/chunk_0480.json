It is optionally programmable to add custom functions and algorithms by using User Defined Extensions (UDX). Payment Card Industry (PCI) PIN\u00ae Transaction Security (PTS) Hardware Security Module (HSM) (PCI-HSM), is available for Crypto Express6S and newer in CCA mode. PCI-HSM mode simplifies compliance with PCI requirements for hardware security modules. \u0002 The Secure IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) coprocessor implements an industry-standardized set of services that adheres to the PKCS #11 specification v2.20 and more recent amendments. It was designed for extended FIPS and Common Criteria evaluations to meet industry requirements This cryptographic coprocessor mode introduced the PKCS #11 secure key function. When the Crypto Express8S PCI Express adapter is configured as a secure IBM CCA co-processor, it still provides accelerator functions. However, up to 3x",
