Tip: The CBU test activation is done the same way as the real activation; that is, by using the same SE Perform a Model Conversion window and selecting the Temporary upgrades option. The HMC windows were changed to avoid accidental real CBU activations by setting the test activation as the default option. Chapter 8. System upgrades 369 CBU example An example of a CBU operation is shown in Figure 8-15. The permanent configuration is a 504, and a record contains seven CP CBU features. During an activation, multiple target configurations are available. With 7 CP CBU features, you can add up to 7CPs within the same MCI, which allows the activation of a 506, 507, through to a 511(the blue path). Alternatively, 4 CP CBU features can be used to change the MCI (in the example from a 504 to a 704) and then add the remaining 3 CP CBU features to upgrade to a 707 (the red path).
