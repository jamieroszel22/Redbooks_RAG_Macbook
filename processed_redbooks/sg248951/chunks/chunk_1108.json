See Figure 12-13 on page 495 and Figure 12-15 on page 497 for details about the new available graphs. Table 12-2 below shows the PUs distribution per drawer for an IBM z16 Max200 according to the number of available configurable PUs. Table 12-2 Configurable PUs available per drawer Figure 12-12 on page 494 shows a Partition Detail Report of an IBM z16, 3931-A01 (Max 200)/700 with 196 CPs (60 GPs, 60 zIIPs, 60 IFLs and 16 ICFs), and four active partitions (1 GP, 1 zIIP, 1 IFL and 1 ICF). Resources are allocated as shown in the Partition Identification and Partition Configuration fields. As this IBM z16 has 196 CPs, (Figure 12-12 on page 494), the PU resources are distributed according to the Table 12-2, and are shown in the Estimated Distribution of RCPs Across Drawers graph in Figure 12-13 on page 495. 8 Your currently installed version of IBM zPCR must be uninstalled before",
