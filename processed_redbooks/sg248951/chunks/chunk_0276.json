If the installed CPC drawer has no remaining unassigned PUs, the assignment of the next zIIP might require the installation of another CPC drawer. PUs that are characterized as zIIPs within a configuration are grouped into the zIIP pool. This configuration allows zIIPs to have their own processing weights, independent of the weight of parent CPs. The zIIP pool can be seen on the hardware console. The number of permanent zIIPs plus temporary zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs plus temporary CPs. Also, the number of temporary zIIPs cannot exceed the number of permanent zIIPs. zIIPs and logical partition definitions zIIPs are dedicated or shared, depending on whether they are part of an LPAR with dedicated or shared CPs.
