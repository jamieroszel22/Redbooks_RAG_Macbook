A request is processed fully in hardware. The Crypto Express accelerator is a coprocessor that is reconfigured by the installation process so that it uses only a subset of the coprocessor functions at a higher speed. Reconfiguration is disruptive to coprocessor and accelerator operations. The coprocessor or accelerator must be deactivated before you begin the reconfiguration. FIPS 140-2 certification is not relevant to the accelerator because it operates with clear keys only. The function extension capability through UDX is not available to the accelerator. 8 At the time of this writing (August 2022) 236 IBM",
