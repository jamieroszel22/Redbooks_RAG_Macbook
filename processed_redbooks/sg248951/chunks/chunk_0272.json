However, the databases become less efficient over time and must be maintained as data in large databases is manipulated. The zIIP runs portions of eligible database workloads, which helps to free computer capacity and lower software costs. Not all Db2 workloads are eligible for zIIP processing. Db2 UDB for z/OS V8 and later gives z/OS the information to direct portions of the work to the zIIP. The result is that in every user situation, different variables determine how much work is redirected to the zIIP. On an IBM z16, the following workloads also can benefit from zIIPs: \u0002 z/OS Communications Server uses the zIIP for eligible Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) network encryption workloads. Portions of IPSec processing take advantage of the zIIPs, specifically end-to-end encryption with IPSec. The IPSec function moves a portion of the processing from the",
