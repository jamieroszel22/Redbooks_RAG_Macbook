Figure 4-3 IBM z16 I/O connectivity(Max39 feature with two PCIe+ I/O drawers represented The PCIe switch card provides the fan-out from the high-speed x16 PCIe host bus to eight individual card slots. The PCIe switch card is connected to the CPC drawer through a single x16 PCIe Gen3 bus from a PCIe fan-out card (PCIe+ fan-out cards on IBM z16 have two PCIe Gen3 x16 ports/busses/links). Chapter 4. Central processor complex I/O structure 153 In the PCIe+ I/O drawer, the eight I/O feature cards that directly attach to the switch card constitute an I/O domain. The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports concurrent add and replace I/O features with which you can increase I/O capability as needed, depending on the CPC drawer. The PCIe slots in a PCIe+ I/O drawer are organized into two I/O domains. Each I/O domain supports up to eight features and is driven through a PCIe switch card. Two PCIe switch cards always",
