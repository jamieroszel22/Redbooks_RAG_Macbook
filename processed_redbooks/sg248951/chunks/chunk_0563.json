The key remains encrypted and the key encrypting key never appears in host storage. When CCA ECC services are used, ICSF can now take advantage of ECC support in CPACF (protected key support) for the following curves: \u2013 Prime: P256, P384, P521 \u2013 Edwards: ED25519, ED448 CPACF can achieve much faster crypto speeds compared to the coprocessor. The translation to protected key happens automatically after the attribute is set in the key token. No application change is required. Chapter 6.
