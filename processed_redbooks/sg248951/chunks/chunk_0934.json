This signal is called N-Mode power signal. In a CTN with PTS and BTS being IBM z16 servers, CTN recovery can be started by the new signal. Systems must have dual power with at least one side of the power capable of holding the power (UPS or similar) for five minutes if a utility power failure occurs. When PCIe-based integrated communication adapter (ICA) Short Reach (SR) links are used, an unambiguous \u201cgoing away signal\u201d is sent when the server on which the coupling link is running is about to enter a failed (check stopped) state. When the \u201cgoing away signal\u201d that is sent by the Current Time Server (CTS) in an STP-only Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) is received",
