Consider the following points: \u0002 BPA1 and BPA2 are always initially installed in Frame A. \u0002 BPA3 and BPA4 are installed to support more components for larger configurations (CPC and I/O drawers). \u0002 BPA1/BPA2 and BPA3/BPA4 for paired redundancy. \u0002 From the rear of the system, the odd-numbered BPAs are above the even-numbered BPAs in both frames. \u0002 The total loss of one BPA in a pair has no effect on system operation. Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully. Chapter 2. Central processor complex hardware components 63 The following components plug into the BPAs X 2 for redundancy: \u0002 CPC Drawers, I/O Drawers, Switches, Radiators, and Support Elements \u0002 The redundancy for each component plugs into the paired BPAs For example, for the top Support Element 1, one power supply",
