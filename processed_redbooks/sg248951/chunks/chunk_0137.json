Installed Physical Memory (DIMM capacity) in configuration reports is addressable memory size. Memory is protected by RAIM. DIMM size includes RAIM overhead. Servers are configured with the most efficient configuration of memory DIMMs that can support Addressable Memory that is required for Customer Ordered Memory plus HSA. In some cases, Available Addressable Memory might be available to support one or more concurrent LIC CC Customer Memory upgrades with no DIMM changes. Chapter 2.
