This feature provides a secure programming and hardware environment wherein crypto processes are performed. Each cryptographic coprocessor includes general-purpose processors, nonvolatile storage, and specialized cryptographic electronics, which are all contained within a tamper-sensing and tamper-responsive enclosure that eliminates all keys and sensitive data on any attempt to tamper with the device. The security features of the HSM are designed to meet the requirements of FIPS 140-2, Level 4, which is the highest security level defined. TKE feature: The Trusted Key Entry (TKE) Workstation feature is required for supporting the administration of the Crypto Express6S when configured as an Enterprise PKCS #11 coprocessor or managing the CCA mode PCI-HSM. 194 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide The Crypto Express7S (2 port), FC 0898 includes",
