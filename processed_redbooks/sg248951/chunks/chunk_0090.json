Coupling links also can carry timing information (such as Server Time Protocol [STP]) for synchronizing time across multiple IBM Z CPCs in a Coordinated Time Network (CTN). For more information about coupling and clustering features, see 4.5, \u201cI/O features\u201d on page 158. 1.2.7 Cryptography IBM z16 provides two main cryptographic functions: CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) and Crypto-Express8S. CPACF CPACF is a high-performance, low-latency coprocessor that performs symmetric key encryption operations and calculates message digests (hashes) in hardware. The following algorithms are supported: \u0002 AES \u0002 Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) \u0002 Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-1 \u0002 SHA-2 \u0002 SHA-3 Chapter 1. Introducing the IBM z16 11 CPACF supports Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) clear key, improving the performance of Elliptic Curve algorithms. The following algorithms are supported: \u0002 EdDSA (Ed448 and Ed25519) \u0002 ECDSA (P-256,",
