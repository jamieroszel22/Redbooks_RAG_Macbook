Creating EDF file with CP3KVMXT (z/VM) CP3KVMXT is the VM Extract Utility for IBM zCP3000 and IBM zPCR Capacity Planning Support Tools. CP3KVMXT reads CP Monitor data from a z/VM system, and generates an Enterprise Data File (EDF) of PR/SM, system image, and workload-related measurements for input into the IBM zCP3000 and IBM zPCR capacity planning tools. A CP3KVMXT-created EDF can be used to model interactive VM workloads or workloads under guest operating systems such as Linux and can be concurrently loaded with a CP3KEXTR-created z/OS EDF for the same data intervals. Do not use MIPS or MSUs for capacity planning: Do not use \u201cone number\u201d capacity comparisons, such as MIPS or MSUs. IBM does not officially announce the processor performance as \u201cMIPS\u201d. MSU is only a number for software license charge and it does not represent the processor's",
