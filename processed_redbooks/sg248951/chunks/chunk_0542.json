  "content": "Because the wrapping key is unique to each LPAR, a protected key cannot be shared with another LPAR. By using key wrapping, CPACF ensures that key material is not visible to applications or operating systems during encryption operations. CPACF code generates the wrapping key and stores it in the protected area of the hardware system area (HSA). The wrapping key is accessible only by firmware. It cannot be accessed by operating systems or applications. DES/T-DES and AES algorithms are implemented in CPACF code with the support of hardware assist functions. Two variations of wrapping keys are generated: one for DES/T-DES keys and another for AES keys. 3 PCIeCC: IBM PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor is the Hardware Security Module (HSM). Chapter 6. Cryptographic features 223 Wrapping keys are generated during the clear reset each time an LPAR is activated or reset. No customizable option is available at Support Element (SE) or Hardware Management Console (HMC) that permits or avoids the",
