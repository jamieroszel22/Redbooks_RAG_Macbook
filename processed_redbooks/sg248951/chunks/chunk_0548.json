  "content": "variable-length tokens are used while maintaining strong levels of security. The Crypto Express8S feature does not include external ports and does not use optical fiber or other cables. It does not use channel path identifiers (CHPIDs), but requires one slot in the PCIe I/O drawer and one physical channel ID (PCHID) for each PCIe cryptographic adapter. Removal of the feature or adapter zeroizes its content. Access to the PCIe cryptographic adapter is controlled through the setup in the image profiles on the SE. Each IBM z16 A01 supports up to 60 HSMs in total (combination of Crypto Express8S (1 or 2 HSMs), Crypto Express7S (1 or 2 ports, and Crypto Express6S). Crypto Express7S (1 or 2 ports) and Crypto Express6S features (single HSM) are not orderable for a new build IBM z16 A01 system, but can be carried forward from an IBM z14 or IBM z15 by using an MES. Configuration information for Crypto Express8S is listed in Table 6-2. Table 6-2 Crypto Express8S features The concept of",
