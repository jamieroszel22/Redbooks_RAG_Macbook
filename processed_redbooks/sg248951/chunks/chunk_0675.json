For more information, see \u201cMigration considerations\u201d on page 191. Chapter 7. Operating system support 283 \u0002 CFCC Message Path Resiliency CF Message Paths use a z/OS-provided system identifier (SYID) to uniquely identify which z/OS system image (and instance of that system image) is sending requests over a message path to the CF. With IBM z15, we are providing a new resiliency mechanism that transparently recovers for this \u201cmissing\u201d message path deactivate (if and when that deactivation ever occurs). During path initialization, the CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active, including the SYID for the path. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness, and if incorrect, gather diagnostic",
