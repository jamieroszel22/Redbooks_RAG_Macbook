  "content": "the cryptographic coprocessor numbers that are automatically brought online during logical partition activation. The numbers that are selected in the online list must also be part of the candidate list. After they are activated, the active partition cryptographic definitions can be viewed from the HMC. Select the CPC, and click View LPAR Cryptographic Controls in the CPC Operational Customization window. The resulting window displays the definition of Usage and Control domain indexes, and PCI Cryptographic candidate and online lists, as shown in Figure 6-7. (Information is provided for active logical partitions only.) Figure 6-7 View LPAR Cryptographic Controls Operational changes can be made by using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task, which reflects the cryptographic definitions in the image profile for the partition. With this function, the cryptographic feature can be added and removed dynamically, without stopping a running operating system. For more information about",
