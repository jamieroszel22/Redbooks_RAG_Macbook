The optimal number of processors to be used is kept within a processor drawer boundary, when possible. Logical partitions PR/SM enables IBM z16 A01 systems to be initialized for a logically partitioned operation, supporting up to 85 LPARs. Each LPAR can run its own operating system image in any image mode, independently from the other LPARs. An LPAR can be added, removed, activated, or deactivated at any time. Changing the number of LPARs is not disruptive and does not require a POR. Certain facilities might not be available to all operating systems because the facilities might have software corequisites. Each LPAR has the following resources that are the same as a real CPC: \u0002 Processors Called logical processors, they can be defined as CPs, IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs. They can be dedicated to an LPAR or shared among LPARs. When shared, a processor weight can be defined to provide the required level of",
