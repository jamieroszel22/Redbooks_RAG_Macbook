Support for hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 always is enabled. 6.4.1 Cryptographic synchronous functions Because the CPACF works synchronously with the PU, it provides cryptographic synchronous functions. For IBM and client-written programs, CPACF functions can be started by using the MSA instructions. z/OS ICSF callable services on z/OS, in-kernel crypto APIs, and a libica cryptographic functions library that is running on Linux on IBM Z also can start CPACF synchronous functions. The following tools might benefit from the throughput improvements for IBM z16 CPACF: \u0002 Db2/IMS encryption tool \u0002 Db2 built-in encryption \u0002 z/OS Communication Server: IPsec/IKE/AT-TLS \u0002 z/OS System SSL \u0002 z/OS Network Authentication Service (Kerberos) \u0002 DFDSS Volume encryption \u0002 z/OS Java SDK \u0002 z/OS Encryption",
