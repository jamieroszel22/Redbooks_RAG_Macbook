It enhances security by requiring what you know (the first factor) and what you have available, which means that only a person who owns a specific phone number can log in. The MFA first factor is the combination of login ID and password; the second factor is TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) that is sent to your smartphone, desktop, or application (for example, Google Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password. The secret key is generated by HMC/SE/TKE while the user is performing first factor log-on. The secret key is known only to HMC/SE/TKE and to the user\u2019s device. For that reason, it must be protected as much as your first factor password. 430 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide MFA code that was",
