On IBM z16 A01, the CPC drawers can hold up to 48 PCIe fan-out cards (four-CPC drawers configuration). Adapter ID number assignment PCIe fan-outs and ports are identified by an Adapter ID (AID) that is initially dependent on their physical locations, which is unlike channels that are installed in a PCIe+ I/O drawer. Those channels are identified by a physical channel ID (PCHID) number that is related to their physical location. This AID must be used to assign a CHPID to the fan-out in the IOCDS definition. The CHPID assignment is done by associating the CHPID to an AID port (see Table 4-2. Table 4-2 Fan-out locations and their AIDs for the CPC drawer (IBM z16 A01) Fan-out slots The fan-out slots are numbered LG01 - LG12 (from left to right), as listed in Table 4-2.",
