The I/O bus infrastructure data rate of up to 128 GBps1 per system (12 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out slots). For more information about coupling link connectivity, see 4.6.4, \u201cParallel Sysplex connectivity\u201d on page 187. \u0002 Connectivity options: \u2013 IBM z16 servers can be connected to an extensive range of interfaces, such as FICON/FCP for SAN connectivity, OSA features for LAN connectivity, and zHyperLink Express for storage connectivity (low latency compared to FICON). \u2013 For CPC to CPC connections, IBM z16 servers use Integrated",
