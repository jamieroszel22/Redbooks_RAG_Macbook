A single CPC drawer IBM z16 A01 does not support EDA. The EDA procedure and careful planning help ensure that all the resources are still available to run critical applications in an (n-1) drawer configuration. This process allows you to avoid planned outages. Consider the flexible memory option to provide more memory resources when you are replacing a drawer. For more information about flexible memory, see 2.5.7, \u201cFlexible Memory Option\u201d on page 46. To minimize the effect on current workloads, ensure that sufficient inactive physical resources exist on the remaining drawers to complete a drawer removal. Also, consider deactivating noncritical system images, such as test or development LPARs. After you stop these noncritical LPARs and free their resources, you might find sufficient inactive resources to contain critical",
