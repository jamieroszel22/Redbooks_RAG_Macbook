The AI capability is applied directly into the running transaction, shifting the traditional paradigm of applying AI to the transactions that were completed. This innovative technology can be used for intelligent IT workloads placement algorithms and contribute to better overall system performance. The co-processor is driven by the new Neural Networks Processing Assist (NNPA) instruction. NNPA is a new nonprivileged Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) memory-to-memory instruction that operates on tensor objects that are in client application program memory. AI functions and macros are abstracted by way of NNPA. Virtual Flash Memory IBM Virtual Flash Memory (FC 0644) offers up to 6.0 TB of memory for IBM z16 A01. VFM is provided for improved application availability and to handle paging workload spikes. IBM Virtual Flash Memory is designed to help improve availability and handling",
