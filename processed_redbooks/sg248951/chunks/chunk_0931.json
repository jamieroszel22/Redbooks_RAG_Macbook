Simplified plugging that is more reliable is included. \u0002 ICA SR (short distance) coupling cards plug straight in (no blind mating of the connector). Simplified plugging that is more reliable is included. \u0002 Coupling Express2 LR (CE2 LR) coupling cards plug into the PCIe+ I/O drawer, which allows more connections with a faster bandwidth. 9.7.2 Unscheduled outages An unscheduled outage occurs because of an unrecoverable malfunction in a hardware component of the system. The following improvements can minimize unscheduled outages: \u0002 Continued focus on firmware quality For LIC and hardware design, failures are eliminated through rigorous design rules; design walk-through; peer reviews; element, subsystem, and system simulation; and extensive engineering and manufacturing",
