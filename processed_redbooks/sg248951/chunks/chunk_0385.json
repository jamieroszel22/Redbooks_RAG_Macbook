  "content": "Gen3 fan-out card provides connectivity to a PCIe+ I/O drawer by using a copper cable. This PCIe fan-out card supports a link rate of 16 GBps (with two links per card). A 16x PCIe copper cable of 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) - 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) is used for connection to the PCIe switch card in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. PCIe fan-out cards are always plugged in pairs and provide redundancy for I/O domains within the PCIe+ I/O drawer. 4.4.2 Integrated Coupling Adapter (FC 0172 and FC 0176) The IBM ICA SR (FC 0172) is a two-port fan-out feature that is used for short distance coupling connectivity and uses channel type CS5. For IBM z16, the new build feature is ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176). The ICA SR (FC 0172) and ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176) use PCIe Gen3 technology, with x16 lanes that are bifurcated into x8 lanes for coupling. Both cards are designed to drive distances up to 150 meters (492 feet) with a link data rate of 8 GBps. ICA SR supports up to four channel-path identifiers (CHPIDs) per port and eight",
