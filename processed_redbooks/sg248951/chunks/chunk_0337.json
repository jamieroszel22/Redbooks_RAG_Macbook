  "content": "to callers. Users might not handle this ambiguity well. CF cache users who use of these nonidempotent constructs experienced occasional customer problems based on it. The only approach that cleanly and completely addresses the issue is to provide retry buffers for the small subset of cache and lock commands that manipulate objects in a nonidempotent way, along with the accompanying transparent z/OS retry buffer use. z/OS transparently provides all the required recovery support and no user participation is needed. Down-level systems can continue to use the \u201cold\u201d software retry support until they are upgraded, while up-level systems that use the same CF structure can take full advantage of the new retry buffers for improved IFCC recovery. APAR OA60275 is required on z/OS V2R2, V2R3, V2R4, and V2R5. \u0002 New lock record data reserved entries for structure full recovery. Some lock structure users use \u201cspecial\u201d lock structure locks to serialize their own processing, such as management of open",
