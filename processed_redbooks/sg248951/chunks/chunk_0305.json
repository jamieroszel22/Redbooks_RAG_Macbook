  "content": "of WLC, the user can specify a defined capacity in millions of service units (MSUs) per hour. The defined capacity sets the capacity of an individual LPAR when soft capping is selected. The defined capacity value is specified on the Options tab in the Customize Image Profiles window. \u2013 WLM keeps a four-hour rolling average of the processor usage of the LPAR. When the four-hour average processor consumption exceeds the defined capacity limit, WLM dynamically activates LPAR capping (soft capping). When the rolling four-hour average returns below the defined capacity, the soft cap is removed. For more information about WLM, see System Programmer's Guide to: Workload Manager, SG24-6472. For more information about software licensing, see 7.8, \u201cSoftware licensing\u201d on page 323. \u0002 Memory Memory (main storage) must be dedicated to an LPAR. The defined storage must be available during the LPAR activation; otherwise, the LPAR activation fails. Reserved storage can be defined to an LPAR, which",
