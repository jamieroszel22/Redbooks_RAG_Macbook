It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use. \u2013 Eliminates the performance degradation that is caused by structure-wide latching. \u2013 A few \u201cedge conditions\u201d in ECR processing still require structure-wide latching to be used to serialize them.
