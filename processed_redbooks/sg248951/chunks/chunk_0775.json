  "content": "Personal Development Tool, a minimum of 2 GB is required for z/OS V2.R3. If the minimum is not met, a warning WTOR is issued at IPL. Continuing with less than the minimum memory might affect availability. A migration health check warns if the system is configured with less than 8 GB. \u0002 Dynamic splitting and merging of Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) is available with IBM z16. \u0002 RMF support is provided to collect SMC-D related performance measurements in SMF 73 Channel Path Activity and SMF 74 subtype 9 PCIe Activity records. It also provides these measurements in the RMF Postprocessor and Monitor III PCIe and Channel Activity reports. HyperSwap support is enhanced to allow RESERVE processing. When a system runs a request to swap to secondary devices that are managed by HyperSwap, z/OS detects when RESERVEs are held and ensures that the devices that are swapped also hold the RESERVE. This enhancement is provided with collaboration from z/OS, GDPS HyperSwap, and CSM HyperSwap. 7.5.6",
