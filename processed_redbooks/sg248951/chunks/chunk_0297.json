On IBM z16 A01 servers, the HSA has a fixed size of 256 GB and is not part of the purchased memory that you order and install. The fixed size of the HSA eliminates planning for future expansion of the HSA because the hardware configuration definition (HCD)/input/output configuration program (IOCP) always reserves space for the following items: \u0002 Six channel subsystems (CSSs) \u0002 A total of 15 LPARs in CSSs 1 through 5, and 10 LPARs for the sixth CSS for a total of 85 LPARs \u0002 Subchannel set 0 with 63.75-K devices in each CSS \u0002 Subchannel set 1 with 64-K devices in each CSS \u0002 Subchannel set 2 with 64-K devices in each CSS \u0002 Subchannel set 3 with 64-K devices in each CSS The HSA features sufficient reserved space to allow for dynamic I/O reconfiguration changes to the maximum capability of the processor. 3.6.4 Virtual Flash Memory (FC 0644) IBM Virtual",
