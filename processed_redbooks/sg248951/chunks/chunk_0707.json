The 63.75-K subchannels Servers before IBM z9 EC reserved 1024 subchannels for internal system use, out of a maximum of 64 K subchannels. Starting with IBM z9 EC, the number of reserved subchannels was reduced to 256, which increased the number of subchannels that are available. Reserved subchannels exist in subchannel set 0 only. One subchannel is reserved in each of subchannel sets 1, 2, and 3. The informal name, 63.75-K subchannels, represents 65280 subchannels, as shown in the following equation: 63 x 1024 + 0.75 x 1024 = 65280 This equation is applicable for",
