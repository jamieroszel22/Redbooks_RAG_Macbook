IBM\u2019s open source hzDNN library provides common APIs for the functions that enable conversions from the Tensor format to the accelerator required format. Customers can run zDNN under z/OS1 and Linux on IBM Z. A Deep Learning Compiler (DLC) for z/OS and Linux also is available that provide the AI functions to the applications. 1 zDNN is zCX eligible, which it runs on zIIPs under z/OS \u00a9 Copyright IBM Corp. 2022.
