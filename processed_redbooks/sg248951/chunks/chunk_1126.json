IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression 509 IBM z16 IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC IBM z16 on-chip compression provides value for existing and new compression users by bringing the compression facility into the PU chip, which is tied in L31 cache. The IBM z16 Integrated Accelerator for zEDC delivers industry-leading throughput and replaces the zEDC Express PCIe adapter that is available on the IBM z14 and earlier servers. IBM z16 compression and decompression are implemented in the Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU, see Figure 3-15 on page 91) on each processor chip and replaces the existing zEDC Express adapter in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. One NXU is available per processor chip, which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits: \u0002 New concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest \u0002 Supports DEFLATE-compliant compression and decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler \u0002 Low latency \u0002 High bandwidth \u0002",
