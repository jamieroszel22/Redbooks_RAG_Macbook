When an operating system that is running on an LPAR assigns a storage increment to its configuration, PR/SM determines whether any free storage increments are available. PR/SM then dynamically brings the storage online. PR/SM dynamically takes offline a storage increment and makes it available to other partitions when an operating system running on an LPAR releases a storage increment. 16 When defining an LPAR on the HMC, the 2 G boundary must be followed in PR/SM.
