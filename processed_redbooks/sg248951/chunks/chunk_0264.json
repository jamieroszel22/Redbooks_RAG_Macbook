  "content": "forced to split the CF workload across more CF images. However, this change brings more configuration complexity and granularity (more, smaller CF images, more coupling links, and logical CHPIDs to define and manage for connectivity, and so on). To improve CF processor scaling for the customer\u2019s CF images and to make effective use of more processors as the sysplex workload increases, CF work management and dispatcher provide the following improvements IBM z16: \u0002 IBM z16 provides improved CF processor scalability for CF images. \u0002 Increased number of CF tasks \u0002 ICA SR latency improvements that improve coupling efficiency in a parallel sysplex. 104 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Coupling Facility Enhancements with CFCC level 25 CFCC level 25 is available on IBM z16 with driver 51.
