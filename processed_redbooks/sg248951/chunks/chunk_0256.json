  "content": "nondisruptive image upgrades. If the operating system in the LPAR supports the logical processor add function, reserved processors are no longer needed. Regardless of the installed model, an LPAR can have up to 200 logical CPs that are defined (the sum of active and reserved logical CPs). In practice, define no more CPs than the operating system supports. All PUs that are characterized as CPs within a configuration are grouped into the CP pool. The CP pool can be seen on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) workplace. Any z/Architecture operating systems and CFCCs can run on CPs that are assigned from the CP pool. The IBM z16 A01 server recognizes four distinct capacity settings for CPs. Full-capacity CPs are identified as CP7. In addition to full-capacity CPs, three subcapacity settings (CP6, CP5, and CP4), each for up to 39 PUs, are offered. The following capacity settings appear in hardware descriptions: \u0002 CP4 Feature Code 1955 (up to 39 PUs) \u0002 CP5 Feature Code 1956 (up to 39 PUs)",
