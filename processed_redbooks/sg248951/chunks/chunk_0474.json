  "content": "considerations Upgrading from previous generations of IBM Z systems in a Parallel Sysplex to IBM z16 servers in that same Parallel Sysplex requires proper planning for coupling connectivity. Planning is important because of the change in the supported type of coupling link adapters and the number of available fan-out slots of the IBM z16 CPC drawers. The ICA SR fan-out features provide short-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server. The CE LR adapter provides long-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server. The IBM z16 fan-out slots in the CPC drawer provide coupling link connectivity through the ICA SR fan-out cards. In addition to coupling links for Parallel Sysplex, the fan-out cards provide connectivity for the PCIe+ I/O drawer (PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out). Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards can be installed in an IBM z16 CPC drawer. To migrate from an older generation machine to an IBM z16 without disruption in a Parallel Sysplex environment",
