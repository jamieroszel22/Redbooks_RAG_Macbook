  "content": "address space. 13 In previous IBM Z generations (before z13), these service operations were known as enhanced book availability (EBA) and concurrent book repair (CBR). Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 115 Each TLB entry represents one page. As with other buffers or caches, lines are discarded from the TLB on a least recently used (LRU) basis. The worst-case translation time occurs when a TLB miss occurs and the segment table (which is needed to find the page table) and the page table (which is needed to find the entry for the particular page in question) are not in cache. This case involves two complete real memory access delays plus the address translation delay. The duration of a processor cycle is much shorter than the duration of a memory cycle, so a TLB miss is relatively costly. It is preferable to have addresses in the TLB. With 4 K pages, holding all of the addresses for 1 MB of storage takes 256 TLB lines. When 1 MB pages are used, it takes only one TLB line.",
