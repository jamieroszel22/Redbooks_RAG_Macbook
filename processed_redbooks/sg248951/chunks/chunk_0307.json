  "content": "implementation. Weight settings: When defined capacity is used to define an uncapped LPAR\u2019s capacity, carefully consider the weight settings of that LPAR. If the weight is much smaller than the defined capacity, PR/SM uses a discontinuous cap pattern to achieve the defined capacity setting. This configuration means PR/SM alternates between capping the LPAR at the MSU value that corresponds to the relative weight settings, and no capping at all. It is best to avoid this scenario and instead attempt to establish a defined capacity that is equal or close to the relative weight. 120 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Fibre Channel connection (FICON) channels can be managed by the Dynamic CHPID Management (DCM) function of the Intelligent Resource Director. DCM enables the system to respond to ever-changing channel requirements by moving channels from lesser-used control units to more heavily used control units, as needed. Modes of operation The modes of operation are listed in Table 3-6. All",
