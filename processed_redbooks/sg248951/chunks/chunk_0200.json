The following types of CPC drawer configurations are available for IBM z16 A01: \u0002 One drawer: Max39 \u0002 Two drawers: Max82 \u0002 Three drawers: Max125 \u0002 Four drawers: Max168 \u0002 Four drawers: Max200 The IBM z16 A01 has up to 24 memory controller units (MCUs) for a Max200 feature (one MCU per PU chip, and up to six MCUs populated per CPC drawer). The MCU configuration uses eight channels Reed-Solomon redundant array of independent memory (RAIM). The RAIM design is new compared to the IBM z15 T01, moving from a 4+1 DIMM structure that is based on 5-channel RAIM design on IBM z15 to an 8-channel R-S RAIM design on the IBM z16. The new memory architecture provides approximately 15% DRAM reduction for a similar RAS, but a higher memory bandwidth at drawer level. The DIMM sizes (32, 64, 128, or 256 GB) include RAIM overhead. An IBM z16 CPC drawer can have up to 48 memory DDR4 DIMMs (populated with 32, 40, or 48 DIMMs). The IBM z16 microprocessor chip (called IBM Telum) integrates a new",
