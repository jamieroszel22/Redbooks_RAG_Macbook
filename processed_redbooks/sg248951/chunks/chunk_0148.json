Central processor complex hardware components 45 Model Upgrades During a model upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation4. Adding physical memory to the added drawer is also concurrent. If all or part of the added memory is enabled for use, it might become available to an active LPAR if the partition includes defined reserved storage. (For more information, see 3.7.3, \u201cReserved storage\u201d on page 126.) Alternatively, the added memory can be used by a defined LPAR that is activated after the memory is added. 2.5.5 Drawer replacement and memory With EDA, which is supported for IBM z16 A01, sufficient resources must be available to accommodate resources that are rendered unavailable when a CPC drawer is removed for upgrade or repair. For more information, see 2.7.1, \u201cRedundant I/O interconnect\u201d on page 52. Removing a CPC drawer often results in removing active memory. With the",
