Cryptographic features 219 ICSF is a software component of z/OS. ICSF works with the hardware cryptographic features and the Security Server (IBM Resource Access Control Facility [IBM RACF] element) to provide secure, high-speed cryptographic services in the z/OS environment. ICSF provides the APIs by which applications request the cryptographic services, and from the CPACF and the Crypto Express features. ICSF transparently routes application requests for cryptographic services to one of the integrated cryptographic engines (CPACF or a Crypto Express feature), depending on performance or requested cryptographic function. ICSF is also the means by which the secure Crypto Express features are loaded with master key",
