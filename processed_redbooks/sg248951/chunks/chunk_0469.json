  "content": "capacity feature code. \u0002 IBM z16 ICA SR maximum depends on the number of CPC drawers. A total of 12 PCIe+ fan-outs are used per CPU drawer, which gives a maximum of 24 ICA SR ports. IBM z16 supports up to 96 ICA SR1.1 and ICA SR ports combined. For more information about distance support for coupling links, see IBM Z End-to-End Extended Distance Guide, SG24-8047. Internal Coupling link IC links are Licensed Internal Code-defined links that are used to connect a CF to a z/OS logical partition in the same CPC. These links are available on all IBM Z platforms. The IC link is an IBM Z coupling connectivity option that enables high-speed, efficient communication between a CF partition and one or more z/OS logical partitions that are running on the same CPC. The IC is a linkless connection (implemented in LIC) and does not require any hardware or cabling. An IC link is a fast coupling link that uses memory-to-memory data transfers. IC links do not have PCHID numbers, but do require CHPIDs.",
