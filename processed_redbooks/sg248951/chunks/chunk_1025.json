STP changes and enhancements Detailed instructions and guidelines are provided within task workflow. IBM z15 HMC provides a visual representation of the CTN topology. A preview of any configuration action is also shown in topological display. An example of the topology view is shown in Figure 10-31. Important: The Sysplex Time task on the SE was discontinued for IBM z15. Therefore, an HMC at Version 2.15.0 is required to manage system time for IBM z15 CPCs. 444 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Figure 10-31 CTN topology visible on HMC Manage System Time window N-mode power sensing for STP recovery For previous IBM Z",
