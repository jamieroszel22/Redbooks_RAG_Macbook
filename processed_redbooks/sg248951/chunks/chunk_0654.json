  "content": "use of SMT to dispatch two threads in a single zIIP logical processor (MT_ZIIP_MODE=2) can be changed dynamically by using the SET OPT=xx setting in the IEAOPTxx parmlib. Changing the MT mode for all cores can take some time to complete. PROCVIEW CORE requires DISPLAY M=CORE and CONFIG CORE to display the core states and configure an entire core. With the introduction of Multi-Threading support for SAPs, a maximum of 88 logical SAPs can be used. RMF is updated to support this change by implementing page break support in the I/O Queuing Activity report that is generated by the RMF Post processor. z/VM V7R3, V7R2, and V7R1 The use of SMT in z/VM is enabled by using the MULTITHREADING statement in the system configuration file. Multithreading is enabled only if z/VM is configured to run with the HiperDispatch vertical polarization mode enabled and with the dispatcher work distribution mode set to reshuffle. The default in z/VM is multithreading disabled. Dynamic SMT enables dynamically",
