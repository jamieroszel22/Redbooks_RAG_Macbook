Figure 2-15 shows the core floor plan, which contains the following units: Figure 2-15 Processor core floor plan \u0002 Fixed-point unit (FXU): The FXU handles fixed-point arithmetic. \u0002 Load-store unit (LSU): The LSU contains the data cache. It is responsible for handling all types of operand accesses of all lengths, modes, and formats as defined in the z/Architecture. \u0002 Instruction fetch and branch (IFB) (prediction) and Instruction cache and merge (ICM). These two sub units (IFB and ICM) contain the instruction cache, branch prediction logic, instruction fetching controls, and buffers. Its relative size is the result of the elaborate branch",
