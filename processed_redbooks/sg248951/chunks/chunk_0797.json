  "content": "Recovery testing. Capacity for Planned Event (CPE) Used when temporary replacement capacity is needed for a short-term event. CPE activates processor capacity temporarily to facilitate moving systems between data centers, upgrades, and other routine management tasks. CPE is an offering of CoD. Capacity levels Can be full capacity or sub-capacity. For an IBM z16 A01 system, capacity levels for the CP engine are 7, 6, 5, and 4. Capacity setting Derived from the capacity level and the number of processors. For the IBM z16 A01 system, the capacity levels are 7nn, 6yy, 5yy, and 4xx, where xx, yy, or nn indicates the number of active CPs. The number of processors can have the following ranges: \u0002 0 - 39 for capacity levels 4xx. An all IFL or an all ICF system has a capacity level of 400. \u0002 1 - 39 for capacity levels 5yy and 6yy. \u0002 1 - 99 in decimal and A0 - K0, where A0 represents 100 and K0 represents 200, for capacity level 7nn. 330 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide Customer Initiated Upgrade",
