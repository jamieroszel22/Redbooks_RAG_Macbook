MASS and ATLAS can reduce the time and effort for middleware and application developers. IBM provides compiler built-in functions for SIMD that software applications can use as needed, such as for using string instructions. 6 The features that are listed here might not be available on all operating systems that are listed in the tables. Chapter 7. Operating system support 277 The use of new hardware instructions require the z/OS V2R5 XL C/C++ compiler with ARCH(14) and TUNE(14) options for targeting IBM z16 instructions. The ARCH(14) compiler option allows the compiler to use any new IBM z16 instructions",
