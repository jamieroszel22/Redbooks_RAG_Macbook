Chapter 11. Environmental requirements 461 Power consumption The utility power consumption for the IBM z16 for the BPA system is listed in Table 11-9. Table 11-9 Utility Power consumption (BPA) for radiator-cooled systems Balanced Power Plan Ahead feature Phase currents are minimized when they are balanced among the three input phases. Balanced Power Plan Ahead (FC 3003) is designed to allow you to order the full complement of bulk power regulators (BPRs) on any configuration to help ensure that the configuration is in a balanced power environment. 11.2.3 Cooling requirements The IBM z16 cooling system is manufactured as a radiator (air) cooled system. The dual chip modules (DCMs) are cooled with an",
