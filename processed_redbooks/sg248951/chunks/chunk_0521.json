  "content": "(widely used) encryption methods Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is based on clear keys. \u0002 The value of a protected key is stored only in clear in memory areas that cannot be read by applications or users. The key value does not exist outside of the physical hardware, although the hardware might not be tamper-resistant. The principle of protected keys is unique to IBM Z. For more information, see 6.4.2, \u201cCPACF protected key\u201d on page 222. \u0002 For a secure key, the key value does not exist in clear format outside of a special hardware device (HSM), which must be secured and tamper-resistant. A secure key is protected from disclosure and misuse, and can be used for the trusted execution of cryptographic algorithms on highly sensitive data. If used and stored outside of the HSM, a secure key must be encrypted with a master key, which is created within the HSM and never leaves the HSM. Because a secure key must be handled in a special hardware device, the use of",
