HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility The HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility allows the streaming of bulk data over a HiperSockets link between two LPARs. Multiple output buffers are supported on a single Signal Adapter (SIGA) write instruction. The key advantage of this enhancement is that it allows the receiving LPAR to process a much larger amount of data per I/O interrupt. This process is transparent to the operating system in the receiving partition. HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility with fewer I/O interrupts is designed to reduce processor use of the sending and receiving partitions. Chapter 7. Operating system support 301 Support for this function is required by the sending operating system. For more information, see \u201cHiperSockets\u201d on page 185. The",
