The PSUs can be concurrently maintained. \u0002 Two dual-function Base Management Cards (BMCs)\\Oscillator Cards (OSCs), which provide redundant interfaces to the internal management network and provide clock synchronization to the IBM Z platform. \u0002 Two dual-function Processor Power Cards (PPC), which control Voltage Regulation, PSU and Fan control. The PPCs are redundant and can be concurrently maintained. \u0002 Five fans are installed at the front of the drawer to provide cooling airflow for the resources that are installed in the drawer except for the PU SCMs, which are internally water-cooled. With the IBM z16, Virtual Flash Memory (VFM) feature is offered from the main memory capacity in 0.5 TB units to increase granularity for the feature. VFM can provide much simpler management and better performance by eliminating the I/O to the adapters in the PCIe+ I/O drawers. 1.2.3 I/O subsystem and I/O drawers The IBM z16 supports a PCIe I/O",
