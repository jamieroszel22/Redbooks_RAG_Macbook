This enhancement enables various data manipulations (such as compression, sorting, cryptography) directly in hardware, on the processor chip by way of purpose-built accelerators. It also provides eligible workloads with low latency time, high performance, and high throughput. The new IBM z16 microprocessor chip, also called the IBM",
