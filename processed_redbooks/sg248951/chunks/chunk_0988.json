Many of the IBM Z capabilities benefit from the various network connectivity options. The following functions are examples that depend on the HMC connectivity: \u0002 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) support, which can be used for HMC user authentication \u0002 Network Time Protocol (NTP) \u0002 RSF through broadband \u0002 HMC remote access and HMC Mobile \u0002 RSA SecurID support \u0002 MFA with Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) HMC File Transfer support FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols are supported on the HMC and SE. All three file transfer protocols require login ID and password credentials. FTPS is based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocol and requires certificates to authenticate the servers. SFTP is based on Secure Shell protocol (SSH) and requires SSH keys to authenticate the servers. Certificates",
