With IBM z15, CFCC provides a new resiliency mechanism that transparently recovers for this \u201cmissing\u201d message path deactivate (if and when that situation ever occurs). The CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active; namely, the current SYID with which the message path is registered in the CF. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness. If an obsolete or incorrect SYID exists in the message path for any reason, z/OS performs the following steps: i. Requests nondisruptive gathering of diagnostic information for the affected message paths and CF image. ii. Reactivates the message path with the correct SYID for the current z/OS image to seamlessly correct the problem. This enhancement requires z/OS XCF/XES use APAR support for IBM z15. \u0002 Shared-Engine CF Default is changed to \u201cDYNDISP=THIN\u201d The CF operates with the following Dynamic",
