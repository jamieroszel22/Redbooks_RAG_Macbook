  "content": "data set level encryption by using DFSMS access methods. This function is designed to give users the ability to encrypt their data sets without changing their application programs. DFSMS users can identify which data sets require encryption by using JCL, Data Class, or the RACF data set profile. Data set level encryption can allow the data to remain encrypted during functions, such as backup and restore, migration and recall, and replication. z/OS Data Set Encryption requires CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF). Considering the significant enhancements that were introduced with z14, the encryption mode of XTS is used by access method encryption to obtain the best performance possible. It is not recommended to enable z/OS data set encryption until all sharing systems, fallback, backup, and DR systems support encryption. In addition to applying PTFs enabling the support, ICSF configuration is required. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-10 on page 263. 314",
