For availability reasons, a minimum of two features is required. Up to 30 Crypto Express8S (2 HSM) features are supported. The maximum number of the 1 HSM features is 16. The Crypto Express8S feature occupies one I/O slot in a PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each adapter can be configured as a Secure IBM CCA coprocessor, a Secure IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) coprocessor, or as an accelerator. Crypto Express8S provides domain support for up to 85 logical partitions. Chapter 4.
