  "content": "total input current is switched to the remaining phase pair without any power interruption. Depending on the configuration input power draw, the system can run from several minutes to indefinitely in this condition. Because most single phase losses are transients that recover in seconds, this redundancy provides protection against virtually all single phase outages. Power cords for the BPAs are attached to the options that are listed in Table 11-5.
