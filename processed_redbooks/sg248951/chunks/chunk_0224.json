  "content": "of which instruction sequences can successfully operate in a long pipeline environment. IBM z16 is a superscalar processor. Each processor unit, or core, is a superscalar and out-of-order processor that supports 10 concurrent issues to execution units in a single CPU cycle: \u0002 Fixed-point unit (FXU): The FXU handles fixed-point arithmetic. \u0002 Load-store unit (LSU): The LSU contains the data cache. It is responsible for handling all types of operand accesses of all lengths, modes, and formats as defined in the z/Architecture. 4 TAgged GEometric predictor. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 85 \u0002 Instruction fetch and branch (IFB) (prediction) and Instruction cache and merge (ICM). These two sub units (IFB and ICM) contain the instruction cache, branch prediction logic, instruction fetching controls, and buffers. Its relative size is the result of the elaborate branch prediction. \u0002 L1 data and L1 instruction are incorporated into the LSU and ICM, respectively. COBOL enhancements",
