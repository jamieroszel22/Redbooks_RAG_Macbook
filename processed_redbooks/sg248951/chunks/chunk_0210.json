For more information, see Chapter 2, \u201cCentral processor complex hardware components\u201d on page 15, and Appendix B, \u201cIBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI\u201d on page 503. Because of these enhancements, the IBM z16 processor full speed z/OS single-thread performance is on average 1.11 times faster than the IBM z15 at equal N-way. For more information about performance, see Chapter 12, \u201cPerformance and capacity planning\u201d on page 473. z13 servers introduced architectural extensions with instructions that reduce processor quiesce effects, cache misses, and pipeline disruption, and increase parallelism",
