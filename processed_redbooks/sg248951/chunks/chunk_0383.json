The fan-out cards also include the ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) coupling links for Parallel Sysplex. All fan-out cards support concurrent add, remove, and move. The IBM z16 CPC drawer I/O infrastructure consists of the following features: \u0002 The PCIe+ Generation 3 fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to PCIe+ I/O drawers. \u0002 ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to other (external) CPCs. The PCIe fan-outs cards are installed in the rear of the CPC drawers. Each CPC drawer features 12 PCIe+ Gen3",
