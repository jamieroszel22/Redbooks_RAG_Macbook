They then connect at the highest common performance speed and duplex mode of interoperation. If the attached Ethernet router or switch does not support auto-negotiation, the OSA-Express port examines the signal that it is receiving and connects at the speed and duplex mode of the device at the other end of the cable. The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE, or OSM. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE. The following settings are supported on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature port: \u0002 Auto-negotiate \u0002 100 Mbps half-duplex or full-duplex \u0002 1000 Mbps full-duplex If auto-negotiate is not used, the OSA-Express port attempts to join the LAN at the specified speed and duplex mode. If this specified speed and duplex mode do not match the",
