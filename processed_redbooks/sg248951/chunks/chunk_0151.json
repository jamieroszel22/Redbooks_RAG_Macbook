When you order memory, you can request extra flexible memory. The extra physical memory, (if required) is calculated by the configuration and priced accordingly. The required memory DIMMs are installed before shipping and are based on a target capacity that is specified by the customer. These memory DIMMs are enabled by using a Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) order that is placed by the customer when they determine more memory capacity is needed. The flexible memory sizes that are available for the IBM z16 A01 are listed in Table 2-10. Table 2-10 Flexible",
