Eliminating adapter sharing by using Nest Compression Accelerator Sharing of zEDC cards is limited to 15 LPAR guests per adapter. The Nest Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processor chip and therefore is available to all LPARs and guests. Moving the compression function from the (PCIe) I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations. Compression modes Compression is run in one of the following modes: \u0002 Synchronous Execution occurs in problem state where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space. \u0002 Asynchronous",
