Each adapter can be configured in the following modes: \u0002 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD \u0002 Non-QDIO, with CHPID type OSE \u0002 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261. OSA-Integrated Console Controller The OSA-Express 1000BASE-T Ethernet features provide the Integrated Console Controller (OSA-ICC) function, which supports TN3270E (RFC 2355) and non-SNA DFT 3270 emulation. The OSA-ICC function is defined as CHPID type OSC and console controller, and includes multiple LPAR support as shared or spanned channels. Notes: Consider the following points: \u0002 Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature. \u0002 OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature supports only 1000 Mbps duplex mode (no auto-negotiation to 100 or 10 Mbps) Note: Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port",
