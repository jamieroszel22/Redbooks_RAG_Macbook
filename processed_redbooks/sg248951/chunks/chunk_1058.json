A calculator that is available on Resource Link calculates power and weight for specific configurations and environmental conditions. Consideration: Power consumption is lower when in a normal ambient temperature room, and for configurations that feature a lesser number of I/O slots, smaller amount of memory, and fewer processors. Power estimation for any configuration, power source, and room condition can be obtained by using the power estimation tool at IBM Resource Link website (authentication required). On the Resource Link page, click Tools \u2192 Power and weight estimation. 462 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide The IBM z16 servers include a recommended (long-term) ambient temperature range of 18\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F) - 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F). The minimum allowed ambient temperature is 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F); the maximum allowed temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). For more",
