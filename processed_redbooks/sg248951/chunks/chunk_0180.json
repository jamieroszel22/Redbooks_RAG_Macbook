  "content": "protection. Characteristics are similar to previous IBM Z, but BPA was redesigned to fit into the 19-inch frame. No PDUs are installed in this configuration; instead, 1 or 2 pairs of BPAs are installed that house the bulk power distribution to all the components, and the Bulk Power Regulators (BPR). With BPA-based configurations, 3-phase balanced power feature is supported. BPA-based systems support radiator-cooled systems. The BPAs support 2- or 4-line cords with a single universal type of 3-phase 200 - 480 V AC. Note: Customer power sources should always maintain redundancy across PDU pairs; that is, one power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A1 and the separate power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A2. As a best practice, connect the odd-numbered PDUs (A1, B1, C1, and D1) to one power source or distribution panel, and the even-numbered PDUs (A2, B2, C2, and D2) to a separate power source or distribution panel.
