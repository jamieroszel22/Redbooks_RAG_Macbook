This feature reduces the number of repair actions for memory. \u0002 Dual tabbed Memory Clock signals. \u0002 Triple DRAM chipkill tolerance. \u0002 Processor drawer power distribution N+2 design. The CPC drawer uses POL cards in a highly redundant N+2 configuration. POL regulators are daughter cards that contain the voltage regulators for the principle logic voltage boundaries in the IBM z16 CPC drawer. They plug into the CPC drawer system board and are nonconcurrent FRUs for the affected drawer (similar to the memory DIMMs). If you can use EDA, the replacement of POL cards is concurrent for the entire IBM Z server. \u0002 Redundant (N+1) Ethernet switches. \u0002 Redundant (N+2) ambient temperature sensors. \u0002 Dual inline memory module (DIMM) field-replaceable unit (FRU) indicators. These indicators imply that a memory module is not error-free and might fail eventually. This indicator gives IBM a warning and provides time to",
