The 10 GbE RoCE Express3 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. Point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class 10 GbE switch are supported. 10 GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0441) 10 GbE RoCE Express3 LR(FC 0441) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and is supported on IBM z16 servers only. The 10 GbE RoCE Express3 LR is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID. It is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the HCD. \u0002 The RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0441) feature on the IBM z16 requires single-mode (SM) 9-micron fiber optic cable for a maximum connection distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). A client-supplied cable is required. The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE",
