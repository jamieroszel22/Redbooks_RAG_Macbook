I/O devices An I/O device provides external storage, a means of communication between data-processing systems, or a means of communication between a system and its environment. In the simplest case, an I/O device is attached to one control unit and is accessible through one or more channel paths that are connected to the control unit. 5.1.2 Multiple subchannel sets A subchannel set is a collection of subchannels within a channel subsystem. The maximum number of subchannels of a subchannel set determines how many I/O devices that a channel subsystem can access. This number also determines the number of addressable devices to the program (for example, an operating system) that is running in the LPAR. Each subchannel has a unique four-digit hexadecimal number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF. Therefore, a single subchannel set can address and access up to 64 K I/O devices. The IBM z16 A01 systems support four",
