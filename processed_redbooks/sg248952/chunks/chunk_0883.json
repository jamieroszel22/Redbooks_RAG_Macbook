The Flexible Capacity Record remains inactive until capacity is shifted from the base system to the target system(s). \u0002 After deactivating the Flexible Capacity Record on the base system, the capacity active through Flexible Capacity Transfer records on the target system(s) should not exceed the capacity active on the base system before the swap. \u0002 If GDPS is used to automate the shift, it must be set up with the correct LIC records to add capacity in the target system(s) and remove capacity in the base system(s) site. 356 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Site swap example Figure 8-13 through Figure 8-15 on page 357 show a sequence of events to move capacity from one site to another using the Flexible Capacity features of the IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ.
