GSF is managed by new instructions that define Guarded Storage Controls and system code to maintain that control information across undispatch and redispatch. Enabling a less-pausing approach improves Java garbage collection. Function is provided on IBM z14 and subsequent servers that are running z/OS V2.R2 and later with APAR OA51643 installed. MACHMIG statement in LOADxx of SYS1.PARMLIB provides ability to disable the function. z/VM Guarded storage facility is designed to improve the performance of garbage-collection processing by various languages, in particular Java. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. Instruction Execution Protection Instruction Execution Protection (IEP) is a hardware function that enables software, such as Language Environment, to mark certain memory regions (for example, a heap",
