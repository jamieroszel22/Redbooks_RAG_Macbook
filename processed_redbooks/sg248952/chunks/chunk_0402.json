Also, z/OS implemented a health check function for FICON dynamic routing. 8 Check with the switch provider for their support statement. Chapter 4. I/O structure 161 Improved zHPF I/O execution at distance By introducing the concept of pre-deposit writes, zHPF reduces the number of round trips of standard FCP I/Os to a single round trip. Originally, this benefit is limited to writes that are less than 64 KB. zHPF on IBM z14 and newer IBM Z were enhanced to allow all large write operations (> 64 KB) at",
