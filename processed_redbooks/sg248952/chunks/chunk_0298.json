Central processor complex design 115 Figure 3-20 CPC drawer number 3.6 Memory design Various considerations of the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ memory design are described in this section. 3.6.1 Overview The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ memory design also provides flexibility, high availability, and the following upgrades: \u0002 Concurrent memory upgrades if the physically installed capacity is not yet reached. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can have more physically installed memory than the initial available capacity. Memory upgrades within the physically installed capacity can be done concurrently by LIC, and no hardware changes are required. However, memory upgrades cannot be done through CBU or On/Off CoD. \u0002 Concurrent memory upgrades if the physically installed capacity is reached are available only for the Max68 system, or very specific upgrades when combining the memory upgrade with a Max32 to Max68 ugprade.
