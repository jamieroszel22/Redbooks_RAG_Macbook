  "content": "available, this data allows the RNI for a production workload to be calculated. By using the RNI and another factor from CPU MF, the L1MP (percentage of data and instruction references that miss the L1 cache), a workload can be classified as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH RNI. This classification and resulting hit are automated in the zPCR tool. It is preferable to use zPCR for capacity sizing. Starting with z/OS V2R1 with APAR OA43366, zFS file is not required any more for CPU MF and Hardware Instrumentation Services (HIS). HIS is a z/OS function that collects hardware event data for processors in SMF records type 113, and a z/OS UNIX System Services output files. Only SMF 113 record is required to know proper workload type by using CPU MF counter data. CPU overhead of CPUMF is minimal. Also, the amount of SMF 113 record is 1% of typical SMF 70 and 72 which RMF writes. CPU MF and HIS can use not only for deciding workload type but also use another purpose. For example, starting with z/OS",
