IBM z16 A02 has a support element task to simulate the EPO function (only used when necessary to do a System Reset Function). \u0002 No DC input feature is available. Internal Battery Feature is not available for z16 A02. \u0002 The system is air-cooled and has redundant design for the blowers (fans) and power supplies. \u0002 No Top Exit Power feature is available because the 19-inch frame is capable of top or bottom exit of power. All line cords are 4.26 meters (14 feet). Combined with the Top Exit I/O Cabling feature, more options are available when you are planning your computer room cabling. \u0002 The new PSCN12 structure uses industry standard Ethernet switches (redundant, 1+1). 2.9.1 Power considerations- IBM z16 A02 (factory frame) The IBM Z operates with redundant power infrastructure. The IBM z16 A02 is designed with a power",
