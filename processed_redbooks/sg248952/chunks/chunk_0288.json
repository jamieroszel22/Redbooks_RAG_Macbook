For more information about zIIP and eligible workloads, see the IBM zIIP web page. zIIP installation One CP must be installed with or before any zIIP is installed. Unassigned zIIPs New on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, a zIIP that is purchased but not activated is registered as an Unassigned zIIP (FC 1975). When the system is later upgraded with another zIIP, the system recognizes that a zIIP was purchased and is present. zIIPs are orderable by using FC 1961. The allowable number of zIIPs for each feature is listed in Table 3-5. Table 3-5 Number of zIIPs per feature If the installed CPC drawer has no remaining unassigned PUs, the assignment of the next zIIP might require the installation of another CPC drawer PUs that are",
