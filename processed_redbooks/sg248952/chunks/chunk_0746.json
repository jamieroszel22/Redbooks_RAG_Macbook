  "content": "Table 7-8 on page 255. QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization enables system programmers and network administrators to coordinate and simultaneously capture software and hardware traces. It allows z/OS to signal OSA-Express features (by using a diagnostic assist function) to stop traces and capture the current trace records. QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization is supported by the OSA-Express features on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255. Chapter 7. Operating system support 301 Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) for OSA Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) creates multiple input queues and allows OSA to differentiate workloads \u201coff the wire.\u201d It then assigns work to a specific input queue (per device) to z/OS. Each input queue is a unique type of workload, and has unique service and processing requirements. The IWQ function allows z/OS to preassign the appropriate processing",
