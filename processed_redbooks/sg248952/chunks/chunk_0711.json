Remember: The need for ICKDSF Release 17 also applies to systems that are not part of the same sysplex, or are running an operating system other than z/OS, such as z/VM. Chapter 7. Operating system support 289 zDAC is designed to run discovery for all systems in a sysplex that support the function. Therefore, zDAC helps to simplify I/O configuration on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ that run z/OS, and reduces complexity and setup time. zDAC applies to all FICON features that are supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ when configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 252 and Table 7-7 on page 253.
