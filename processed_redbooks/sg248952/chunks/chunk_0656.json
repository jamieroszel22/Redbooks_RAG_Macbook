When PROCVIEW CORE or CORE,CPU_OK are specified in z/OS that is running on an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, HiperDispatch is forced to run as enabled, and you cannot disable HiperDispatch. The PROCVIEW statement cannot be changed dynamically; therefore, you must re-IPL after changing it to make the new setting effective. The MT_ZIIP_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx controls zIIP SMT mode. It can be 1 (the default), where only one thread can be running in a core, or 2, where up two threads can be running in a core. If PROCVIEW CPU is specified, the MT_ZIIP_MODE is always 1. Otherwise, the use of SMT to dispatch two threads in a single zIIP logical processor (MT_ZIIP_MODE=2) can be changed dynamically by using the SET OPT=xx setting in the IEAOPTxx parmlib. Changing the MT mode for all cores can take some time to complete.
