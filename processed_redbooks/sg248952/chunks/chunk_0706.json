In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following functions: \u0002 DFSMS striping \u0002 Access method compression \u0002 Extended addressability (EA) EA is useful for creating large Db2 partitions (larger than 4 GB). Striping can be used to increase sequential throughput, or to spread random I/Os across multiple logical volumes. DFSMS striping is useful for using multiple channels in parallel for one data set. The Db2 logs are often striped to optimize the performance of Db2 sequential inserts. Processing an I/O operation to an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set. With MIDAW, the additional CCW for the EF data set suffix is eliminated. MIDAWs benefit EF and non-EF data sets. For example, to read 12 4 K records from a non-EF data set on a 3390 track, Media Manager chains together 12 CCWs by using data chaining. To read 12 4 K records from an EF data set, 24 CCWs are chained",
