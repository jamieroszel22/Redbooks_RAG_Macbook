  "content": "algorithm is adjusted to maximize throughput. In all cases, the TCP/IP stack determines the best setting based on the current system and environmental conditions, such as inbound workload volume, processor utilization, and traffic patterns. It can then dynamically update the settings. Supported OSA-Express features adapt to the changes, which avoids thrashing and frequent updates to the OAT. Based on the TCP/IP settings, OSA holds the packets before presenting them to the host. A dynamic setting is designed to avoid or minimize host interrupts. OSA Dynamic LAN idle is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255. OSA Layer 3 virtual MAC for z/OS environments To help simplify the infrastructure and facilitate load balancing when an LPAR is sharing an OSA MAC address with another LPAR, each operating system instance can have its own unique logical or virtual",
