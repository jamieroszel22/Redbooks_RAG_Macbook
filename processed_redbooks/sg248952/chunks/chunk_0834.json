For both, the PU total is the sum of CPs and zIIPs. z/VM V7R2 and later 80 (or 40 in SMT mode). 21CS VSEn 21CS VSEn Turbo Dispatcher can use up to 4CPs, and tolerates up to 10-way LPARs. z/TPF 86 CPs. Linux on IBM Z The IBM z16 limit is 200 CPs although Linuxa supports 256 cores without SMT and 128 cores with SMT (256 threads). a. Supported Linux on IBM Z distributions (for more information, see Chapter 7, \u201cOperating system support\u201d on page 243). Chapter 8. System upgrades 335 larger capacity size. After physical installation the LICCC is then installed to enable the extra memory. With proper planning, memory can be added nondisruptive to z/OS partitions and z/VM partitions. If necessary, new LPARs can be created nondisruptive to use the newly added",
