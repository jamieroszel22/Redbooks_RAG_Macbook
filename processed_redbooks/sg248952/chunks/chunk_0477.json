  "content": "subchannel sets\u201d on page 206. Channel paths A channel path provides a connection between the channel subsystem and control units that allows the channel subsystem to communicate with I/O devices. Depending on the type of connections, a channel path might be a physical connection to a control unit with I/O devices, such as FICON, or an internal logical control unit, such as HiperSockets. Each channel path in a channel subsystem features a unique 2-digit hexadecimal identifier that is known as a channel-path identifier (CHPID), which ranges 00 - FF. Therefore, a total of 256 CHPIDs are supported by a CSS, and a maximum of 768 CHPIDs are available on an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ with three logical channel subsystems. By assigning a CHPID to a physical port of an I/O feature adapter, such as FICON Express32S, or a fanout adapter (ICA SR) port, the channel subsystem connects to the I/O devices through these physical ports. A port on an I/O feature card features a unique physical channel",
