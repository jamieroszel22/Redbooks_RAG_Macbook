Tip: If no workload condition is specified, the full capacity that is described in the policy is activated and deactivated at the start and end times that are specified in the policy. 350 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Planning considerations for using automatic provisioning Although only one On/Off CoD offering can be active at any one time, several On/Off CoD offerings can be present on the system. Changing from one to another requires stopping the active one before the inactive one can be activated. This operation decreases the current capacity during the change. The provisioning management routines can interrogate the installed offerings, their content, and the status of the content of the offering.
