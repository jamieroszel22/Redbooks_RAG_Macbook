  "content": "tamper-responding Crypto-Express8S features provide acceleration for high-performance cryptographic operations and support up to 40 domains with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. This specialized hardware performs AES, DES and TDES, RSA, Elliptic Curve (ECC), SHA-1, and SHA-2, and other cryptographic operations. It supports specialized high-level cryptographic APIs and functions, including those functions that are required with quantum-safe cryptography and in the banking industry. Crypto-Express8S features are designed to meet the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 4 and PCI HSM security requirements for hardware security modules. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are the industry's first quantum-safe systems9. \u0002 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ quantum-safe secure boot technology helps to protect IBM Z firmware from quantum attacks through a build-in dual signature scheme with no changes required. \u0002 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ quantum-safe technology and key management",
