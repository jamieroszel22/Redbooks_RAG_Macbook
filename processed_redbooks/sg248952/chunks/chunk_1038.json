CCA firmware and PKCS #11 firmware cannot coexist in a card. The Trusted Key Entry (TKE) Workstation with smart card reader feature is required to support the administration of the Crypto Express8S when configured as an Enterprise PKCS #11 coprocessor. To support the new Crypto Express8S card, the TKE 10.0 is needed. An example of the Cryptographic Configuration window is shown in Figure 10-34. Figure 10-34 Cryptographic Configuration window The Usage Domain Zeroize task is provided to clear the appropriate partition crypto keys for a usage domain when you remove a crypto card from a partition. Crypto Express8/7/6S in EP11 mode is configured to the standby state after the zeroize process. Chapter 10.
