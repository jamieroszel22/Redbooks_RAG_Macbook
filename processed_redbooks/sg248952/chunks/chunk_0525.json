For the SHA hashing algorithms and the random number generation algorithms, only clear keys are used. For the symmetric encryption and decryption DES and AES algorithms and clear keys, protected keys can also be used. On IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, protected keys require a Crypto Express adapter that is running in CCA mode. For more information, see 6.5.2, \u201cCrypto Express8S as a CCA coprocessor\u201d on page 219. The hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, are enabled on all systems and do not require the CPACF enablement feature. For all other algorithms, the no-charge CPACF enablement feature (FC 3863) is required. The CPACF functions are implemented as processor instructions and require operating system support for use. Operating systems that use the CPACF instructions include z/OS, z/VM, 21CS VSEn, z/TPF,",
