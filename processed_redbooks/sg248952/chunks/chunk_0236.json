Its relative size is the result of the elaborate branch prediction. \u0002 L1 data and L1 instruction are incorporated into the LSU and ICM, respectively. COBOL enhancements IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ core implement new instructions for the compiler to accelerate numeric formatting, and hardware support for new numeric conversion instructions (exponents and arithmetic common in financial applications). 3.4.5 On-chip coprocessors and accelerators This section introduces the CPACF enhancements for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ and the IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC). IBM integrated Accelerator for zEDC (on-chip) Introduced in IBM z15, the On-Chip data compression accelerator (Nest Accelerator Unit - NXU, see Figure 3-12 on page 89) provides real value for existing and new data compression use cases.
