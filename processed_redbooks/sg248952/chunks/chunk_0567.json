The usage domains cannot be removed if they are online. The numbers that are selected must match the domain numbers that are entered in the Options data set when you start this partition instance of ICSF. The same usage domain index can be used by multiple partitions, regardless to which CSS they are defined. However, the combination of PCIe adapter number and usage domain index number must be",
