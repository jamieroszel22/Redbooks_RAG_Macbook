This approach also enables you to update and replenish temporary upgrades, even in situations where the upgrades are active. Likewise, depending on the configuration, permanent upgrades can be performed while temporary upgrades are active. Examples of the activation sequence of multiple temporary upgrades are shown in Figure 8-2.
