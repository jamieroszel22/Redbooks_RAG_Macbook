  "content": "only the capacity that is installed can be activated. At activation, you can decide to activate only a subset of the CBU features that are ordered for the system. Subcapacity makes a difference in the way that the CBU features are completed. On the full-capacity models, the CBU features indicate the amount of extra capacity that is needed. If the amount of necessary CBU capacity is equal to four CPs, the CBU configuration is four CBU CPs. The number of CBU CPs must be equal to or greater than the number of CPs in the base configuration. Also, all of the CPs in the CBU configuration must have the same capacity setting. For example, if the base configuration is a two-way D02, providing a CBU configuration of a four-way of the same capacity setting requires two CBU feature codes. If the required CBU capacity changes the capacity setting of the CPs, going from model capacity identifier D02 to a CBU configuration of a four-way E04 requires four CBU feature codes: two to upgrade from a D02",
