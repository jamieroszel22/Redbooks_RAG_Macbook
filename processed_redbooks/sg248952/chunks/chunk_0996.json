Ethernet switches often include the following characteristics: \u0002 A total of 16 auto-negotiation ports \u0002 100/1000 Mbps data rate \u0002 Full or half duplex operation \u0002 Auto medium-dependent interface crossover (MDIX) on all ports \u0002 Port status LEDs \u0002 Copper RJ45 connections 10.3.5 TCP/IP Version 6 on the HMC and SE The HMC and SE can communicate by using IPv4, IPv6, or both. IPv6 link-local addresses feature the following characteristics: \u0002 Every IPv6 network interface is assigned a link-local IP address. \u0002 A link-local address is used on a single link (subnet) only and is never routed. \u0002 Two IPv6-capable hosts on a subnet can communicate by using link-local addresses, without having any other IP addresses assigned. This is the reason, if HMC to SE IPv6 link-local is working, that the SE/CPC appears in System Management -> Unmanaged Systems on the HMC. Note: The recommendation is to use an Ethernet switch with 1000",
