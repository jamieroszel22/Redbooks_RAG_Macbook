  "content": "manages IBM Z hardware, its logical partitions (LPARs), and provides support applications. At least one HMC is required to operate an IBM Z. An HMC can manage multiple IBM Z CPCs. When tasks are performed at the HMC, the commands are routed to the Primary SE of the target IBM Z. The SE then issues those commands to the according CPC. With HMC and SE Driver 41/Version 2.15.0, a number of \u201ctraditional\u201d SE-only functions moved to HMC tasks. On the HMC these functions appear as native HMC tasks, but run on the SE. These HMC functions run in parallel with Single Object Operations (SOOs), which simplifies and streamlines system management. For more information about SOOs, see \u201cSingle Object Operations (SOO)\u201d on page 422. Check the following introduction videos for the HMC at https://ibm.biz/IBM-Z-HMC. Note: HMC Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 supports managing IBM Z N-2 server generations IBM z14, IBM z15 and IBM z16. Chapter 10. Hardware Management Console and Support Element 395 10.2 HMC and SE",
