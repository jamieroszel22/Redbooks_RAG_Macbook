The cryptographic functions include the full range of cryptographic operations that are necessary for local and global business and financial institution applications. User Defined Extensions (UDX) allow you to add custom cryptographic functions to the functions that IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ systems offer. 6.2 Cryptography overview Throughout history, a need existed for secret communication between people that cannot be understood by outside parties. Also, it is necessary to ensure that a message cannot be corrupted (message integrity), while ensuring that the sender and the receiver really are the persons who they claim to be.

Many procedures and algorithms for encrypting and decrypting data were developed that are increasingly complicated and time-consuming. 6.2.1 Modern",
