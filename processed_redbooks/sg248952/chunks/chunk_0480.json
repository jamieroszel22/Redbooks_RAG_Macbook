Subchannel number The subchannel number is a four-digit hexadecimal number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF, which is assigned to a subchannel within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem. Subchannels in each subchannel set are always assigned subchannel numbers within a single range of contiguous numbers. The lowest-numbered subchannel is subchannel 0, and the highest-numbered subchannel includes a subchannel number equal to one less than the maximum numbers of subchannels that are supported by the subchannel set. Therefore, a subchannel number is always unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem and depends on the sequence of assigning. With the subchannel numbers, a program that is running on an LPAR (for example, an operating system) can specify all I/O functions relative to a specific I/O device by designating a subchannel that is assigned to the I/O devices. Normally, subchannel numbers are used only in communication between the programs and",
