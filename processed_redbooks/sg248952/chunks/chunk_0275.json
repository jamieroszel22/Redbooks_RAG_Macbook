  "content": "The coupling facility images share an ICF. Figure 3-18 ICF options - shared ICFs The LPAR processing weights are used to define how much processor capacity each CF image can include. The capped option also can be set for a test CF image to protect the production environment. Connections between these z/OS and CF images can use internal coupling links to avoid the use of real (external) coupling links, and get the best link bandwidth available. Dynamic CF dispatching The dynamic coupling facility dispatching (DYNDISP) function features a dispatching algorithm that you can use to define a backup CF in an LPAR on the system. When this LPAR is in backup mode, it uses few processor resources. DYNDISP allows more environments with multiple CF images to coexist in a server, and to share CF engines with reasonable performance. DYNDISP THIN is the only option for CF images that use shared processors on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. For more information, see 3.9.3, \u201cDynamic CF dispatching\u201d on",
