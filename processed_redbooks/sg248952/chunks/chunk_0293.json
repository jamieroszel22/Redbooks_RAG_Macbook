The PU assignment is based on CPC drawer plug order (not \u201cordering\u201d). Feature upgrade provides additional dual-chip modules (e.g. Max16 to Max32) or a fully populated CPC drawer (e.g. Max32 to Max68). The CPC drawers are populated from the bottom up. This process defines following the low-order and the high-order CPC drawers: \u0002 CPC drawer 1 (CPC 0 at position A10)15: Plug order 1 (low-order CPC drawer) \u0002 CPC drawer 2 (CPC 1 at position A15)15: Plug order 2 The assignment rules comply with the following order: \u0002 Spare: CPC drawers 0 and 1 are assigned one spare each on the high PU chip. In the features Max5, Max16, and Max32, both spares are assigned to CPC drawer 0. \u0002 IFP: Two IFP\u2019s are assigned to CPC drawer 0. \u0002 SAPs: Spread across CPC drawers and high PU chips. Each CPC drawer includes at least five standard SAPs. Start with the highest PU chip high",
