The IC link is an IBM Z coupling connectivity option that enables high-speed, efficient communication between a CF partition and one or more z/OS logical partitions that are running on the same CPC. The IC is a linkless connection (implemented in LIC) and does not require any hardware or cabling. An IC link is a fast coupling link that uses memory-to-memory data transfers. IC links do not have PCHID numbers, but do require CHPIDs. IC links have the following attributes: \u0002 They provide the fastest connectivity that is significantly faster than external link alternatives.
