IBM z14 and newer IBM Z allow for the modification of these default assignments, which also allows FCP channels to keep previously assigned WWPNs, even after being moved to a different slot position. This capability can eliminate the need for reconfiguration of the SAN in many situations, and is especially helpful during a system upgrade (FC 0099 - WWPN Persistence). FICON support for multiple-hop cascaded SAN configurations Before the introduction of z13 and z13s, IBM Z FICON SAN configurations supported a single ISL (a single hop) in a cascaded FICON SAN environment only. 9 z/VSE is not supported on the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. 162 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide IBM z14 and newer IBM Z support up to three hops in a cascaded FICON SAN environment. This support allows clients to more easily configure a three- or",
