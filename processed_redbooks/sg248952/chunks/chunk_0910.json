Reliability, availability, and serviceability 373 EDA is a procedure under which a CPC drawer in a multidrawer system can be removed and reinstalled during an upgrade or repair action with no effect on the workload. \u0002 Concurrent memory upgrade or replacement (concurrent replacement available on Max68 feature only). Memory can be upgraded concurrently by using Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) if physical memory is available on the drawers. The EDA function can be useful if the physical memory cards must be changed in a 2-CPC drawer system (requiring the drawer to be removed). It requires",
