For example, a system administrator can set all of the z/OS systems in an environment to device number 1000 for their system RES volumes. Note: Do not confuse the multiple subchannel sets function with multiple channel subsystems. 192 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide With multiple subchannel sets, a subchannel is assigned to a specific I/O device by the channel subsystem with an automatically assigned subchannel number and a device number that is defined by user. An I/O device can always be identified by an SSID with a subchannel number or a device number. For example, a device with device number AB00 of subchannel set 1 can be designated as 1AB00. Normally, the subchannel number is used by the programs to communicate with the channel subsystem and I/O device, whereas the device number is used by a system programmer, operator, and",
