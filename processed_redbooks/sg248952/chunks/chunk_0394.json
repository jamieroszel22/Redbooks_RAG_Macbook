The data flow on the unaffected channels on the same feature can continue. A problem with one FICON Express port does not require replacement of a complete feature. Each FICON Express feature also supports cascading, which is the connection of two FICON Directors in succession. This configuration minimizes the number of cross-site connections and helps reduce implementation costs for disaster recovery applications, IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex\u2122 (GDPS), and remote copy. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ configurations support 32K devices per FICON channel for all FICON features. Each FICON Express channel can be defined independently for connectivity to servers, switches, directors, disks, tapes, and",
