When using CCA ECC services, ICSF can now take advantage of ECC support in CPACF (protected key support) for these curves: \u2013 Prime: P256, P384, P521 \u2013 Edwards: ED25519, ED448 CPACF can achieve much faster crypto speeds compared to the coprocessor The translation to protected key happens automatically once the attribute is set in the key token.
