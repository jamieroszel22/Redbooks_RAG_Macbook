Consideration: FICON Express32S features do not support auto-negotiation to a data link rate of 2 or 4 Gbps (only 8, 16, or 32 Gbps) for point to point connections. To connect to lower speed devices a compatible switch must be used. Chapter 4. I/O structure 159 FICON Express16S+ The FICON Express16S+ feature is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each of the two independent ports is capable of 4 Gbps, 8 Gbps, or 16 Gbps. The link speed depends on the capability of the attached switch or device. The link speed is auto-negotiated, point-to-point, and is transparent to users and applications.
