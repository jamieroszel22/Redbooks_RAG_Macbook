Up to six MCUs are available in a CPC drawer (one or two per DCM) and provide the interface to the DIMM controller. A memory controller uses eight DIMM slots. The buses are organized in the following configurations: \u0002 The M-bus provides interconnects between PUs chips in the same DCM \u0002 The X-bus provides interconnects between PUs chips to each other, in the same drawer The A-bus provides interconnects between CPC drawers using SMP9 cables. 2.2.1 CPC drawer interconnect topology The point-to-point SMP9 connection topology for CPC",
