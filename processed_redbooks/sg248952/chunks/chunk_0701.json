IBM laboratory tests indicate that applications that use EF data sets, such as Db2, or long chains of small blocks can gain significant performance benefits by using the MIDAW facility. Requirement: All FICON channel path identifiers (CHPIDs) that are defined to the same LCU must support zHPF. The inclusion of any non-compliant zHPF features in the path group causes the entire path group to support command mode only. Chapter 7. Operating system support 285 MIDAW is supported on FICON channels that are configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 252 and Table 7-7 on page 253. MIDAW technical description An IDAW is used to specify data addresses for I/O operations in a virtual environment.9 The IDAW design allows the first IDAW in a list to point to any address within a page. Subsequent IDAWs in the same list must point to the first byte in a page. Also, IDAWs (except the",
