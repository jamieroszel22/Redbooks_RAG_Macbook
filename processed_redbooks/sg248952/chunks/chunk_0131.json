The loss of one power supply leaves enough power to satisfy the drawer\u2019s power requirements (N+1 redundancy). The power supplies can be concurrently removed and replaced (one at a time). \u2013 5x 12v distribution point-of-load (POL) that plug in slots that divide the memory banks, N+2 \u2013 3x Voltage Regulator",
