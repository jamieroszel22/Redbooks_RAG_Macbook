When running in goal mode, WLM sets the priority for an LPAR and coordinates this activity among clustered LPARs. For more information about implementing LPAR processor management under IRD, see z/OS Intelligent Resource Director, SG24-5952. 3.9 Clustering technology Parallel Sysplex is the clustering technology that is used with IBM Z servers. The components of a Parallel Sysplex as implemented within the z/Architecture are shown in Figure 3-22 on page 132. The example in Figure 3-22 on page 132 shows one of many possible Parallel Sysplex configurations. 132 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Figure 3-22 Sysplex hardware overview Figure 3-22 shows an IBM z16 A02 or an IBM z16 AGZ system (represented by IBM z16 in the figure) that contains multiple z/OS sysplex",
