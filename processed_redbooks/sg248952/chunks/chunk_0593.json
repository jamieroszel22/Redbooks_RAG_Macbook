  "content": "use - IBM document. With secure boot enabled, an IPL fails if a component containing code is not signed or cannot be verified. IBM Secure Boot for Linux allows validation of signed Linux kernels to prevent non-approved Linux kernels from booting, based on a previously validated root of trust established for the firmware Bootloader. For details about how to prepare a device for secure boot, see zipl modes and syntax overview in Linux on IBM Z documentation. Kernel interfaces are restricted in a kernel that is prepared for secure boot. In particular, in a kernel prepared for secure boot, all kernel modules must be signed. Instructions about how to boot Linux from DASD (ECKD) are detailed in Booting from DASD Linux on IBM Z documentation website. Note: KVM: You can IPL a KVM guest from a device with the secure boot format, but signatures are not verified. Chapter 6.
