Figure 6-11 z/OS Validated Boot Process (via LD-IPL) 6.9.2 Secure Boot for ECKD devices Linux on IBM Z has supported secure boot from FCP-attached devices since IBM z15. With support for a Validated Boot for z/OS, support in IBM z16 extends existing Linux secure boot capabilities to ECKD devices and allows client-provided validation certificates provided through the SE/HMC to be used for validation purposes during Linux secure boot. This new function is embedded in the baseline offering functionality. In addition, z/VM(R) 7.3 has been enhanced with support to securely boot a Linux guest. Before you can use an ECKD type DASD as a disk for Linux on IBM Z, you must format it with a suitable disk layout. You must then create a file systemor define a swap space.
