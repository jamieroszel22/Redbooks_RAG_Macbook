A new z/OSMF Compliance fact collection REST API sends an ENF86 signal to all systems. Participating products and components will collect and write compliance data to new SMF 1154 records associated with its unique subtype. These new SMF 1154 records may be integrated into solutions such as the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ IBM Z Security and Compliance Center. This support requires PTFs for z/OS 2.4 and z/OS 2.5. The PTFs will be identified by a fix category designated specifically for Compliance data collection support named IBM.Function.Compliance.DataCollection.
