Figure 4-4 shows the supported Coupling Link connections for the IBM z16 A0214. Only ICA SR and CE LR links are supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, IBM z15, and IBM z14 ZR1 systems. Figure 4-4 Parallel Sysplex connectivity options The coupling link options that are listed in Table 4-10 on page 179. Also listed are the coupling link support for each IBM Z platform. Restrictions on the maximum numbers can apply, depending on the configuration. Always check with your IBM support team for more information. Note: Parallel Sysplex supports connectivity between systems that differ by up to two generations (n-2). For example, an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can participate in an IBM Parallel Sysplex cluster with IBM z15, and IBM z14 systems. Only Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and",
