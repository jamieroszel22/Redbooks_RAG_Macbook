HiperSockets internal networks support the following transport modes: \u0002 Layer 2 (link layer) \u0002 Layer 3 (network or IP layer) Traffic can be IPv4 or IPv6, or non-IP, such as AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA. HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device (Layer 2 and Layer 3 mode) features its own Media Access Control (MAC) address. This address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of 176 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Layer 2 addresses, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers and firewalls. Layer 2 support helps facilitate server consolidation, and can reduce complexity and simplify network configuration. It also allows LAN administrators to maintain the mainframe network environment similarly to non-mainframe environments. Packet forwarding decisions are based on Layer 2 information instead of Layer 3. The HiperSockets device can run",
