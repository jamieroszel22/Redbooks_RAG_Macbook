Sample configuration of the system (rear view) is shown in Figure 2-2 on page 23 (systems with two CPC drawers). The IBM z16 A02 is built in a 19-inch form factor, 42 EIA units frame (A-frame). The base frame is 40 EIA units high with a 2U removable top. FC 9975 is available if a height reduction is necessary. Single CPC drawer system PCIe+ I/O drawers are provided as required by the number of I/O adapters ordered. For systems with a single CPC drawer, the PCIe+ I/O drawers (1, 2, and 3) are installed in order in the following EIA locations: A01B, A20B, and A28B. The possible configurations for an IBM z16 A02 (viewed from the rear of the system) are shown in \u201cIBM z16 A02 - Single Frame (Factory Frame) configurations\u201d on page 484. The number of PDUs depends on the system configuration. A system with a single CPC drawer",
