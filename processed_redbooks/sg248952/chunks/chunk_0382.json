A PCHID number is based on the following factors: \u0002 PCIe+ I/O drawer location \u0002 Channel feature slot number \u0002 Port number of the channel feature A CHPID does not directly correspond to a hardware channel port. Instead, it is assigned to a PCHID in the hardware configuration definition (HCD) or IOCP. A PCHID REPORT is created for each new build configuration and for upgrades. The report lists all I/O features that are installed, the physical slot location, and the assigned PCHID. A portion of a sample PCHID REPORT is shown in Example 4-2. For more information about the AID numbering rules for coupling links, see Example 4-2 Example 4-2 PCHID REPORT CHPIDSTART",
