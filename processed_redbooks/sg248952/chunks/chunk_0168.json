The hardware has many RAS features that are built into it. For more information, see Chapter 9, \u201cReliability, availability, and serviceability\u201d on page 365. 2.7 Connectivity Connections to PCIe+ I/O drawers and Integrated Coupling Adapters are driven from the CPC drawer fanout cards. (see 2.4, \u201cPCIe+ I/O drawer\u201d on page 41). These fanouts are installed in the rear of the CPC drawer. Figure 2-21 shows the location of the fanout slots. Each slot is identified with a location code (label) of LGxx. Figure 2-21 Fanout locations in the CPC drawer Up to 12 PCIe fanouts (LG01 - LG12) can be installed in each CPC drawer. A fanout can be repaired",
