Independent channel recovery with replay buffers on all interfaces allows recovery of a single DIMM channel, while other channels remain active. Further redundancies are incorporated in I/O pins for clock lines to main memory, which eliminates the loss of memory clocks because of connector (pin) failure. The following RAS enhancements reduce service complexity: \u0002 Continued use of RAIM ECC. \u0002 RAIM logic moved on DIMM \u0002 N+1 on-DIMM voltage regulation \u0002 Replay buffer for hardware retry on soft errors on the main memory interface. \u0002 Redundant I/O pins for clock lines to main memory. \u0002 Staggered refresh for performance",
