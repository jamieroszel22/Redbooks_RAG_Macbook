Central processor complex design 117 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ implement a faster dynamic memory reallocation mechanism, which is especially useful during service operations (EDA and CDR)18. PR/SM controls the reassignment of the content of a specific physical memory array in one CPC drawer to a physical memory array in another CPC drawer. To accomplish this task, PR/SM uses all the available physical memory in the system. This memory includes the memory that is not in use by the system that is available but not purchased by the client if installed. Because of the memory allocation algorithm, systems that undergo many miscellaneous equipment specification (MES) upgrades for memory can have different memory mixes and quantities in all processor drawers of the system. If the memory fails, it is technically feasible to run a",
