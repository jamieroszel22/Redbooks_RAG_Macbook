  "content": "On the coupling facility (CF) side: \u2013 A CF command or a CF signal (arrival of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal) is received by a shared-engine CF image. \u2013 The completion of a CF signal that was previously sent by the CF occurs (completion of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal). \u0002 On the z/OS side: \u2013 CF signal is received by a shared-engine z/OS image (arrival of a List Notification signal). \u2013 An asynchronous CF operation completes. The interrupt causes the receiving partition to be dispatched by an LPAR if it is not dispatched. This process allows the request, signal, or request completion to be recognized and processed in a more timely manner. After the image is dispatched, \u201cpoll for work\u201d logic in CFCC and z/OS can be used largely as-is to locate and process the work. The new interrupt expedites the redispatching of the partition.
