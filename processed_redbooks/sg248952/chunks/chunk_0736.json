OSA-Express6S 10-Gigabit Ethernet LR and SR (carry forward) OSA-Express6S 10-Gigabit Ethernet features are installed in the PCIe I/O drawer, which is supported by the 16 GBps PCIe Gen3 host bus. The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express5S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity. OSA-Express6S features have been introduced with IBM z14 and can be carried forward to an IBM z15 (T01 and T02), as well as ordered with a new IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. Note: Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature.
