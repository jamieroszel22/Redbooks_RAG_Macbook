For specific configurations the Power & weight estimation tool, also on Resource Link, can be used to estimate a more precise power consumption based on the configuration and data center conditions. On Resource Link click Tools \u2192 Power and weight estimation. 11.3.2 Cooling requirements The IBM z16 AGZ is an air cooled system. All internal components are air cooled (heatsink cooled by forced air). PCIe+ I/O drawers, power enclosures, and CPC drawers are also cooled by chilled air with blowers. The IBM z16 AGZ support ASHRAE2 Class A3 guidelines, which recommends a (long-term) ambient temperature range of 18\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F) - 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F). The minimum allowed ambient temperature is 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) and the maximum allowed temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Note: IBM z16 AGZ with one CPC drawer (Max5, Max16, and Max32) can have the PDUs powered with single-phase power cords. Systems with",
