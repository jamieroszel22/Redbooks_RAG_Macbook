CFCC also changes to relinquish control of the processor when all available pending work is exhausted, or when the LPAR undispatches it off the shared processor, whichever comes first. CF processor combinations A CF image can have one of the following combinations that are defined in the image profile: \u0002 Dedicated ICFs \u0002 Shared ICFs \u0002 Dedicated CPs \u0002 Shared CPs Shared ICFs add flexibility. However, running only with shared coupling facility PUs (ICFs or CPs) is not a preferable production configuration. It is preferable for a production CF to operate by using dedicated ICFs. In Figure 3-18, the CPC on the left has two environments that are defined (production and test), and each has one z/OS and one coupling facility image.",
