An LPAR must define an amount of main storage: \u0002 The initial value is the storage size that is allocated to the partition when it is activated. \u0002 The reserved value is another storage capacity that is beyond its initial storage size that an LPAR can acquire dynamically. The reserved storage sizes that are defined to an LPAR do not have to be available when the partition is activated. Instead, they are predefined storage sizes to allow a storage increase, from an LPAR perspective. Note: For information about the (kernel) supported amount of memory, check the Linux Distribution specific documentation. For the current supported Linux on IBM Z see the following website. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 129 Without the reserved storage definition, an LPAR storage upgrade is a disruptive process that requires the following steps: 1. Partition deactivation. 2. An initial storage size definition change. 3. Partition activation. The extra storage capacity for an",
