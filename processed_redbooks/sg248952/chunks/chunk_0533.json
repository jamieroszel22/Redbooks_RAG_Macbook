Access to the PCIe cryptographic adapter is controlled through the setup in the image profiles on the SE. Each IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ supports up to 40 Hardware Security Modules in total (a combination of Crypto Express8S (1 or 2 HSM), Crypto Express7S (1 or 2 port), and Crypto Express6S). Crypto Express7S (1 or 2 port) and Crypto Express6S features (single HSM) are not orderable for a new build IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ but can be carried forward from an IBM z14 ZR1or IBM z15 T02 by using an MES. Configuration information for Crypto Express7S is listed in Table 6-2. Table 6-2 Crypto features supported on IBM A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Attention: Switching between configuration modes erases all adapter secrets. The exception is when you are switching from Secure CCA to accelerator, and vice versa. Adapter: Although PCIe cryptographic adapters include no CHPID type and are not identified as",
