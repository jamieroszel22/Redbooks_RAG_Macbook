To overcome the processor usage that is associated with creating a 1 MB page, a process must run for some time. It also must maintain frequent memory access to keep the pertinent addresses in the TLB. Short-running work does not overcome the processor usage. Short processes with small working sets are expected to receive little or no improvement. Long-running work with high memory-access frequency is the best candidate to benefit from large pages. Long-running work with low memory-access frequency is less likely to maintain its entries in the TLB. However, when it does run, few address translations are required to resolve all of the 18 EDA and CDR are only possible for Max68 feature. 118 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide memory it needs. Therefore, a long-running process can benefit even without frequent memory access. Weigh the benefits of",
