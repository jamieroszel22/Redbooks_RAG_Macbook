  "content": "IBM Knowledge Center. z/TPF z/TPF on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can use more processors immediately without reactivating the LPAR or IPLing the z/TPF system. When z/TPF is running in a shared processor configuration, the achieved MIPS is higher when z/TPF is using a minimum set of processors. In low-utilization periods, z/TPF minimizes the processor footprint by compressing TPF workload onto a minimal set of I-streams (engines), which reduces the effect on other LPARs and allows the entire CPC to operate more efficiently. As a consequence, z/OS and z/VM experience less contention from the z/TPF system when the z/TPF system is operating at periods of low demand. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. Important: z16 M/T 3932 users must use the FIXCATs for both the 3932 and the 3931. The Required FIXCAT is absolutely critical, and cannot be understated. Only unique capabilities for the 3932 will be identified with the 3932 FIXCATs.",
