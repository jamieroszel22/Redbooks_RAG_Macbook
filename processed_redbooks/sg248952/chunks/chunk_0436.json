  "content": "point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class switch are supported (ports running at matching speeds). 10GbE RoCE Express2 (FC 412) 10GbE RoCE Express2 (FC 0412) is installed in the PCIe I/O drawer and is supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ configurations as carry forward. The 10GbE RoCE Express2 is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID and is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD). The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 300 meters (984 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. The following types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 10 GbE switch or to another 10GbE RoCE Express2 feature: \u0002 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector; supports 300 meters (984 feet) \u0002 OM2 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 500 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex",
