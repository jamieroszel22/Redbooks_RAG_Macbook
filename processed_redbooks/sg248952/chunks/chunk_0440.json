Identified by the PNETID parameter, each ISM VCHID defines an isolated, internal virtual network for SMC-D communication, without any hardware component required. Virtual adapters are defined by virtual function (VF) statements. Multiple 10GbE RoCE Express2 requirements: \u0002 The 10GbE RoCE Express2 feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only. \u0002 25GbE and 10GbE RoCE features should not be mixed in a z/OS SMC-R Link Group. Chapter 4. I/O structure 175 LPARs can access the same virtual network for SMC-D data exchange by associating their VF with same VCHID. Applications that use HiperSockets can realize network latency and CPU reduction benefits and performance improvement by using the SMC-D over ISM. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a",
