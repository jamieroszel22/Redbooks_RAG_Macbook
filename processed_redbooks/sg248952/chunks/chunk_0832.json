An upgrade to an MCI A12 is current, as with a Max16 you have in total 16 PUs to characterize. The next upgrade step from A12 to A20 and additional 2 IFLs is non-concurrent, as you need additional PUs to fulfil the 20 CPs and 2 IFLs. The next possible Max feature is Max32. To reach the 32 PUs, additional physical HW (two additional DCMs) has to be non-concurrently installed. The number of processors that are supported by various operating systems releases are listed in Table 8-3. Table 8-3 Number of processors that are supported by operating system Software charges, which are based on the total capacity of the system on which the software is installed, are adjusted to the new capacity",
