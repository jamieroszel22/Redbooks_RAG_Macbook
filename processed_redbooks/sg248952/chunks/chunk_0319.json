  "content": "(CMT). The CMT is an optional tool that is used to map CHPIDs onto physical channel IDs (PCHIDs). PCHIDs represent the physical location of a port on a card in an I/O cage, I/O drawer, or PCIe I/O drawer. IOCP is available on the z/OS, z/VM, and 21CS VSEn operating systems, and as a stand-alone program on the hardware console. For more information, see IBM Z Input/Output Configuration Program User\u2019s Guide for ICP IOCP, SB10-7172. HCD is available on the z/OS and z/VM operating systems. Consult the appropriate 3932DEVICE Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets before implementation. Fibre Channel connection (FICON) channels can be managed by the Dynamic CHPID Management (DCM) function of the Intelligent Resource Director. DCM enables the system to respond to ever-changing channel requirements by moving channels from lesser-used control units to more heavily used control units, as needed. Modes of operation The modes of operation are listed in Table 3-7. All available mode",
