When an operating system running on an LPAR assigns a storage increment to its configuration, PR/SM determines whether any free storage increments are available. PR/SM then dynamically brings the storage online. PR/SM dynamically takes offline a storage increment and makes it available to other partitions when an operating system running on an LPAR releases a storage increment. 3.8 Intelligent Resource Director Intelligent Resource Director (IRD) is an IBM Z capability that is used only by z/OS. IRD is a function that optimizes processor and channel resource utilization across LPARs within a single IBM Z server. This feature extends the concept of goal-oriented resource management. It does so by grouping system images that are on the same z16 or Z servers",
