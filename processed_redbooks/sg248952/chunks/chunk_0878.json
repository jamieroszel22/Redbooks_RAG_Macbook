  "content": "the LPAR weight can be changed or the number of logical processors can be concurrently increased by configuring reserved processors online. The operating system must concurrently configure more processors online. If necessary, more LPARs can be created to use the newly added capacity. Planning: CBU for processors provides a concurrent upgrade. This upgrade can result in more enabled processors, changed capacity settings that are available to a system configuration, or both. You can activate a subset of the CBU features that are ordered for the system. Therefore, more planning and tasks are required for nondisruptive logical upgrades. For more information, see \u201cGuidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades\u201d on page 362. 354 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide CBU deactivation To deactivate the CBU, the extra resources must be released from the LPARs by the operating systems. In some cases, this process involves varying the resources offline. In other cases, it can mean shutting down",
