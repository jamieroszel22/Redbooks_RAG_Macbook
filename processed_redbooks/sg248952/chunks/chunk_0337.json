Removing memory from a z/VM guest is not disruptive to the z/VM LPAR. 3.7.4 Logical partition storage granularity Granularity of main storage for an LPAR depends on the largest main storage amount that is defined for initial or reserved main storage, as listed in Table 3-922. Table 3-9 Logical partition main storage granularity (IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ) LPAR storage granularity information is required for LPAR image setup and for z/OS RSU definition. On IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, LPARs support maximum size of 16 TB of main",
