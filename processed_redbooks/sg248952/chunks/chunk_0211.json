  "content": "Max68 feature (one MCU per PU chip, and up to six MCUs populated per CPC drawer). The MCU configuration uses eight-channel Reed-Solomon redundant array of independent memory (RAIM). The RAIM design is new compared to the IBM z15 T02, moving from a 4+1 DIMM structure that is based on 5-channel RAIM design on IBM z15 to an 8-channel R-S RAIM design on the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The new memory architecture provides approximately 15% DRAM reduction for a similar RAS, but a higher memory bandwidth at drawer level. The DIMM sizes (32, 64, 128, or 256 GB) include RAIM overhead. An IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ CPC drawer can have up to 48 memory DDR4 DIMMs (populated with 16, 32, 40, or 48 DIMMs). The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ microprocessor chip (called IBM Telum) integrates a new cache hierarchy design with only two levels of physical cache (L1 and L2). The cache hierarchy (L1, L2) is implemented with dense static random access memory (SRAM). Unlike the IBM z15, eDRAM cache is no",
