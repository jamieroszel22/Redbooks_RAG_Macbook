  "content": "the routing between the channel and control unit based on the Fibre Channel Exchange ID. Each I/O operation has a unique exchange ID. FIDR is designed to support static SAN routing policies and dynamic routing policies. FICON Dynamic Routing can help clients reduce costs by providing the following features: \u2013 Share SANs between their FICON and FCP traffic. \u2013 Improve performance because of SAN dynamic routing policies that better use all the available ISL bandwidth through higher use of the ISLs, 376 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide \u2013 Simplify management of their SAN fabrics by using static routing policies that assign different ISL routes with each power-on-reset (POR), which makes the SAN fabric performance difficult to predict. Clients must ensure that all devices in their FICON SAN support FICON Dynamic Routing before they implement this feature. 9.7 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ RAS functions Hardware RAS function improvements focus on addressing all sources of outages.",
