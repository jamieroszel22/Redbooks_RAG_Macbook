Therefore, your CBU contract requires more CBU features when the capacity setting of the CPs is changed. CBU can add CPs through LICCC only, and the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ A01 must have the correct number of installed CPC drawers to allow the required upgrade. CBU can Chapter 8. System upgrades 353 change the model capacity identifier to a higher value than the base setting, but does not change the system model. The CBU feature cannot decrease the capacity setting. A CBU contract must be in place before the special code that enables this capability can be installed on the system. CBU features can be added to an BM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ non disruptively. For each system enabled for CBU, the authorization to use CBU is available for 1 - 5 years. The alternative configuration is activated temporarily, and provides more capacity than",
