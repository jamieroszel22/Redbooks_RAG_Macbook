A secure key is protected from disclosure and misuse, and can be used for the trusted execution of cryptographic algorithms on highly sensitive data. If used and stored outside of the HSM, a secure key must be encrypted with a master key, which is created within the HSM and never leaves the HSM. Because a secure key must be handled in a special hardware device, the use of secure keys usually is far slower than the use of clear keys, as shown in Figure 6-1. b Figure 6-1 Three levels of protection with three levels of speed Chapter 6. Cryptographic features 205 6.2.4 Algorithms The following algorithms of modern cryptography are differentiated based on whether they use the same key for the encryption of the message as for the decryption: \u0002 Symmetric algorithms use the same key to encrypt and to decrypt data.",
