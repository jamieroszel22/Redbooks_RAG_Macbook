  "content": "Sysplex is displayed as a single entity to the operator, user, and database administrator. A single system view means reduced complexity from operational and definition perspectives. \u0002 N-2 support: Multiple hardware generations (normally three) are supported in the same Parallel Sysplex. This configuration provides for a gradual evolution of the systems in the Parallel Sysplex without changing all of them simultaneously. Software support for multiple releases or versions is also supported. Through state-of-the-art cluster technology, the power of multiple images can be harnessed to work in concert on common workloads. The IBM Z Parallel Sysplex cluster takes the commercial strengths of the platform to improved levels of system management, competitive price performance, scalable growth, and continuous availability. 3.9.1 CF Control Code The LPAR that is running the CFCC can be on z16, z15, or z14 systems.
