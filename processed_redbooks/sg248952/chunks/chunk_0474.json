This fixed size memory for HSA eliminates the requirement for more planning of the initial I/O configuration and pre-planning for future I/O expansions. The following objects are always reserved in the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ HSA during POR, whether they are defined in the IOCDS for use: \u0002 Three LCSSs \u0002 A total of 15 LPARs in each LCSS0 and LCSS1 \u0002 A total of 10 LPARs in LCSS2 \u0002 Subchannel set 0 with 63.75 K devices in each LCSS \u0002 Subchannel set 1 with 64 K minus one device in each LCSS \u0002 Subchannel set 2 with 64 K minus one device in each LCSS 5.1.1 Multiple logical channel subsystems In the z/Architecture, a single channel subsystem can have up to 256 channel paths that are defined, which limited the total numbers of I/O connectivity on older IBM Z systems to 256. The introduction of multiple LCSSs enabled an IBM Z to have more than one channel subsystems logically, while each logical channel subsystem",
