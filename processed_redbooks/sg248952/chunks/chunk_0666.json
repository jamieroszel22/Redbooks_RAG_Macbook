SMF 30 records have been enhanced to include new crypto counter sections that contain counters for CPACF cryptographic instructions utilized by a job in a given period. These sections are produced only for those instructions that are used. These counters are correlated with z/OS jobs and users for the determination of the algorithms, bit lengths and key security utilized by a given workload. This data can aid in compliance, performance and configuration. The SMF 30 self-defining section indicates the length and number of crypto counter sections The SMF 30 product / subsystem section indicates if the crypto counters are active This feature is supported on z/OS 2.4 and later. It requires APAR OA61511. Large",
