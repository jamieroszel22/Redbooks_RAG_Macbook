IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ include standard cryptographic hardware and optional cryptographic features for flexibility and growth capability. IBM has a long history of providing hardware cryptographic solutions. This history stretches from the development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in the 1970s to the Crypto Express tamper-sensing and tamper-responding programmable features. Attention: Many older cryptographic algorithms like DES or RSA, and hashing algorithms such as SHA1 are considered weak",
