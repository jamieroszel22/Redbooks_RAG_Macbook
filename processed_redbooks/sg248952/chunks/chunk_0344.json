For more information, see Parallel Sysplex Application Considerations, SG24-6523. \u0002 High capacity: 1- 32 z/OS images in a Parallel Sysplex operating as a single system. \u0002 Dynamic workload balancing: Because it is viewed as a single logical resource, work can be directed to any operating system image in a Parallel Sysplex cluster that has available capacity. \u0002 Systems management: The architecture defines the infrastructure to satisfy client requirements for continuous availability. It also provides techniques for achieving simplified systems management consistent with this requirement. \u0002 Resource sharing: Several base z/OS components use CF shared storage. This configuration enables sharing of physical resources with significant improvements in cost, performance, and simplified systems management. Chapter 3.
