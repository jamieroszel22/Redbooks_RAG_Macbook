You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file. The details of extra capacity and the rules for its provisioning are stored in a policy file. These two files are created and maintained through the Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC).The operational flow of Capacity Provisioning is shown in Figure 8-10 on page 347. Chapter 8. System upgrades 347 Figure 8-10 The capacity provisioning process and infrastructure The z/OS WLM manages the workload by goals and business importance on each z/OS system. WLM metrics are available through existing interfaces, and are reported through IBM Resource Measurement Facility (RMF) Monitor III, with one RMF gatherer for each z/OS system. Sysplex-wide data aggregation and propagation occur in the RMF Distributed Data Server (DDS). The RMF Common Information Model",
