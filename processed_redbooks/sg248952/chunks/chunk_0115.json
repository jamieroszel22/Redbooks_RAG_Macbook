The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can be configured with one or two central processor complex (CPC) drawers, and up to three Peripheral Component Interconnect Express+ (PCIe+) I/O drawers. Figure 2-1 shows the differences between the available IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ air cooled systems. Figure 2-1 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Similar to the predecessor z15 T02, the redesigned CPC drawer and I/O infrastructure also lowers power consumption, reduces the footprint, and allows installation in virtually",
