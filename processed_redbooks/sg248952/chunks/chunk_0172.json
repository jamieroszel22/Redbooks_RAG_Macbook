During a CPC Drawer PCIe+ Gen3 fanout or cable failure, all 16 PCIe cards in the two domains can be driven through a single PCIe switch card (Figure 2-24 on page 56). Note: The PCIe Interconnect (switch) adapter must be installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer to maintain the interconnect across I/O domains. If the adapter is removed (for a service operation), the I/O cards in that domain (up to eight) become unavailable. 56 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Figure 2-24 Redundant I/O Interconnect 2.7.2 Enhanced drawer availability (EDA) With EDA, the effect of CPC drawer replacement is minimized. In a dual CPC drawer system, a single CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for an upgrade or repair. Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer. Before removing the CPC drawer, the contents of the PUs and memory of the",
