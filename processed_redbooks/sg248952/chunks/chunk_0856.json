  "content": "resource tokens, you must deactivate the temporary capacity manually. Deactivation is done from the SE and is nondisruptive. Depending on how the capacity was added to the LPARs, you might be required to perform tasks at the LPAR level to remove it. For example, you might have to configure offline any CPs that were added to the partition, deactivate LPARs that were created to use the temporary capacity, or both. On/Off CoD orders can be staged in Resource Link so that multiple orders are available. An order can be downloaded and activated only once. If a different On/Off CoD order is required or a permanent upgrade is needed, it can be downloaded and activated without having to restore the system to its original purchased capacity. In support of automation, an API is available that allows the activation of the On/Off CoD records. The activation is performed from the HMC and requires specifying the order number. With this API, automation code can be used to send an activation command",
