  "content": "with no transaction left behind so clients are able to derive the valuable insights from their data instantly. The AI capability is applied directly into the running transaction - shifting the traditional paradigm of applying AI to the transactions that have already completed. This innovative technology can be used for intelligent IT workloads placement algorithms, contributing to better overall system performance. The co-processor is driven by the new NNPA (Neural Networks Processing Assist) instruction. 274 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide NNPA is a new non-privileged CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) memory-to-memory instruction that operates on tensor objects that are in client application program memory. AI functions and macros are abstracted via NNPA. Virtual Flash Memory IBM Virtual Flash Memory (FC 0644) offers up to 2.0 TB of memory for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. VFM is provided for improved application availability and to handle paging workload spikes. IBM",
