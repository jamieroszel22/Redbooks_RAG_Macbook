The following new functions provide performance improvements for applications by using new IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ instructions: 17 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ does not support InfiniBand coupling links. More planning might be required to integrate the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ in a Parallel Sysplex with IBM z14servers. 314 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide \u0002 High performance math libraries \u0002 MASS \u0002 Replace Atlas with OpenBLAS \u0002 Metal C for modernizing HLASM applications and systems programming To enable the use of new functions, specify ARCH(14) and VECTOR for",
