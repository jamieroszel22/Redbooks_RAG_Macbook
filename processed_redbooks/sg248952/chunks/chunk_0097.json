Therefore, network connectivity covers not only the connections between the platform and external networks with Open Systems Adapter-Express (OSA-Express) and RoCE Express features, it supports specialized internal connections for intra-system communication through IBM HiperSockets and Internal Shared Memory (ISM). OSA-Express The OSA-Express features provide local area network (LAN) connectivity and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, OSA-Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. OSA-Express7S 1.2 features continue to support copper and fiber optic (single-mode and multi-mode) environments. HiperSockets IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the IBM Z platforms that supplies attachments to up to 32 high-speed virtual LANs, with minimal system and",
