Review the current PSP buckets to ensure that the latest support levels are known and included as part of the implementation plan. CP Assist for Cryptographic Function Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF), which is standard13 on every IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ core, now supports pervasive encryption. Simple policy 304 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide controls allow business to enable encryption to protect data in mission-critical databases without needing to stop the database or re-create database objects.
