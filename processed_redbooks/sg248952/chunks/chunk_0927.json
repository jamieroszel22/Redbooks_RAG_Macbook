In a CTN with both PTS and BTS being IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, CTN recovery can be initiated by the new signal. Systems must have dual power with at least one side of the power capable of holding the power (UPS or similar) for five minutes in case of utility power failure. When PCIe-based integrated",
