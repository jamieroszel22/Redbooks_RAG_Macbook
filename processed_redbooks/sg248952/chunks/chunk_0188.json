  "content": "Specialty engines (ICFs, IFLs, and zIIPs) run at full capacity for all capacity settings. This fact also applies to CBU for specialty engines. The minimum and maximum (min-max) numbers of all types of CBUs that can be activated on each of the features are listed in Table 2-14. The CBU record can contain larger numbers of CBUs than can fit in the current feature. Table 2-14 Capacity Backup matrix 2.8.4 On/Off Capacity on Demand and CPs On/Off CoD provides temporary capacity for all types of characterized PUs. Relative to granular capacity, On/Off CoD for CPs is treated similarly to the way that CBU is handled. On/Off CoD and granular capacity When temporary capacity that is requested by On/Off CoD for CPs matches the model capacity identifier range of the permanent CP feature, the total number of active CPs equals the sum of the number of permanent CPs plus the number of temporary CPs ordered. For example, when a model capacity identifier D03 has two CPs added temporarily, it becomes a",
