Capacity Provisioning Manager The provisioning architecture enables clients to better control the configuration and activation of the On/Off CoD. For more information, see Chapter 8, \u201cSystem upgrades\u201d on page 317. This process is inherently more flexible and can be automated. This capability can result in easier, faster, and more reliable management of the processing capacity. The Capacity Provisioning Manager, which is a feature that was first available with z/OS V1R9, interfaces with z/OS Workload Manager (WLM) and implements capacity provisioning policies. Several implementation options are available, from an analysis mode that issues only guidelines, to an autonomic mode that provides fully automated operations. Replacing manual monitoring with autonomic management or supporting manual operation with guidelines can help ensure that sufficient processing power is available with the",
