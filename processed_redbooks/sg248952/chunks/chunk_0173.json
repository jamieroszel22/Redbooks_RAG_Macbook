Also, sufficient redundant memory must be available if no degradation of applications is allowed. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA. Removal of a CPC drawer also removes the CPC drawer connectivity to the I/O drawers, PCIe I/O drawers, and coupling links. The effect of the removal of the CPC drawer on the system is limited by the use of redundant I/O interconnect. (For more information, see 2.7.1, \u201cRedundant I/O interconnect\u201d on page 54.) However, all ICA SR1.1 links that are installed in the removed CPC drawer must be configured offline. If the enhanced drawer availability is not used when a CPC drawer must be replaced, the memory in the failing drawer is also removed. This process might be necessary during an upgrade or a repair action. Until the removed CPC drawer is replaced, a power-on reset of the system with",
