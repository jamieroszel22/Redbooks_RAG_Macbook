This configuration allows RoCE to be extended to more workloads. 294 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide z/OS Communications Server (CS) provides a new software device driver ConnectX4 (CX4) for RoCE Express2. The device driver is not apparent to both upper layers of the CS (the SMC-R and TCP/IP stack) and application software (using TCP sockets). RoCE Express2 introduces a minor change in how the physical port is configured. RMF 2.2 and later is also enhanced to recognize the new CX4 card type and properly display CX4 cards in the PCIE Activity reports. Support in select Linux on IBM Z distributions is now provided for Shared Memory Communications over Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R) using the supported RoCE Express features. For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page. The RoCE Express3 features can also provide local area network (LAN) connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with",
