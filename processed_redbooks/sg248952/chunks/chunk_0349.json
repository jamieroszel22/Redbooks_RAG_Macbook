For more information about CF configurations, see the following resources: \u0002 Coupling Facility Configuration Options, GF22-5042 \u0002 This IBM Support web page 3.10 Virtual Flash Memory Flash Express is not supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. This feature was replaced by Virtual Flash Memory (VFM), with IBM z14. The Virtual Flash Memory feature code is 0644 on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. 3.10.1 Overview VFM replaced the PCIe Flash Express feature with support that is based on main memory. The \u201cstorage class memory\u201d that is provided by Flash Express adapters is replaced with memory that is allocated from main memory (VFM). VFM helps improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when running z/OS. With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM",
