  "content": "fetching Instruction fetching normally tries to get as far ahead of instruction decoding and execution as possible because of the relatively large instruction buffers that are available. In the microprocessor, smaller instruction buffers are used. The operation code is fetched from the I-cache and put in instruction buffers that hold prefetched data that is awaiting decoding. Instruction decoding The processor can decode up to six instructions per cycle. The result of the decoding process is queued and later used to form a group. Instruction grouping From the instruction queue, up to 12 instructions can be completed on every cycle. A complete description of the rules is beyond the scope of this publication. The compilers and JVMs are responsible for selecting instructions that best fit with the superscalar microprocessor. They abide by the rules to create code that best uses the superscalar implementation. All IBM Z compilers and JVMs are constantly updated to benefit from new",
