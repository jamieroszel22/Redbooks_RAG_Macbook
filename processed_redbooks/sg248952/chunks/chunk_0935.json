When you perform the review, document the resources that can be made available if the EDA is used. The resources on the drawers are allocated during a POR of the system and can change after that process. Perform a review when changes are made to your IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, such as adding a second drawer, PUs, memory, or channels. Also, perform a review when workloads are added or removed, or if the HiperDispatch feature was enabled and disabled since the last time you performed a POR. 9.8.2 Enhanced drawer availability processing To use the EDA, first ensure that the following conditions are met: \u0002 Free the used processors (PUs) on the drawer that is removed. \u0002 Free the used memory on the drawer. \u0002 For all I/O domains that are connected to the drawer and ensure that alternative paths exist. Otherwise, place the I/O paths offline. For the EDA process, this phase is the preparation phase. It is",
