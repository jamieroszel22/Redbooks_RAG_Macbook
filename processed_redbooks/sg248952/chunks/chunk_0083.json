However, concurrent processor unit upgrades require that more From/To System IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ IBM z14 ZR1 Y IBM z15 T02 Y Chapter 1. Introduction and overview 9 processor units are physically installed, but not activated previously. Upgrades from previous IBM Z generations are disruptive via frame roll MES. Feature upgrades within IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ are concurrent from Max5 to Max16 and from Max32 to Max68, while upgrades from Max5 or Max16 to Max32 are disruptive (require system downtime). IBM z16 AGZ upgrade from Max32 to Max68 is concurrent only when plan-ahead feature is ordered. For more information see also 2.8.1, \u201cUpgrades\u201d on page 58. 1.2.2 Capacity and performance The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ offer 156 capacity levels for z/OS. In all, there are 26 subcapacity levels for up to 6 CPs (26 x 6 = 156 subcapacity levels) for z/OS workloads. The IBM z16",
