ICSF provides the APIs by which applications request the cryptographic services, and from the CPACF and the Crypto Express features. ICSF transparently routes application requests for cryptographic services to one of the integrated cryptographic engines (CPACF or a Crypto Express feature), depending on performance or requested cryptographic function. ICSF is also the means by which the secure Crypto Express features are loaded with master key values, which allows the hardware features to be used by applications. The cryptographic hardware that is installed in IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ determines the cryptographic features and services that are available to the applications. The users of the cryptographic services call the ICSF API. Some functions are performed by the ICSF software without",
