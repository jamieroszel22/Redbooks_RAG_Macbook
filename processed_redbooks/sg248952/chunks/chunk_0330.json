  "content": "capping is ideal for processor types and operating systems that the z/OS WLM cannot control. Absolute capping is not intended as a replacement for defined capacity or group capacity for z/OS, which are managed by WLM. Absolute capping can be used with any z/OS, z/VM, or Linux on Z LPAR (that is running on an IBM Z server). If specified for a z/OS LPAR, absolute capping can be used concurrently with defined capacity or group capacity management for z/OS. When used concurrently, the absolute capacity limit becomes effective before other capping controls. Dynamic Partition Manager mode DPM is an IBM Z operation mode that provides a simplified approach to create and manage virtualized environments, which reduces the barriers of its adoption for new and existing customers. The implementation provides built-in integrated capabilities that allow advanced virtualization management on IBM Z servers. With DPM, you can use your Linux and virtualization skills while taking advantage of the full",
