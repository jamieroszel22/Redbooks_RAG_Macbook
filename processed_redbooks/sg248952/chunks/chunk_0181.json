The reminder PUs (feature dependent) can be characterized as IFLs, ICFs, unassigned IFLs, zIIPs (if CPs are available) and extra SAPs. The 156 defined ranges of subcapacity settings feature model capacity identifiers numbered A01- Z01, A02 - Z02, A03 - Z03, A04 - Z04, A05 - Z05, and A06 - Z0611. List of model capacity identifiers (MCI) Regardless of the number of CPC drawers, a configuration with one characterized CP is possible, as listed in Figure 2-26 on page 61. 11 Max5 max subcapacities are A05 to z05. Consideration: All CPs have the same capacity identifier. Specialty engines (IFLs, zIIPs, and ICFs) operate at full speed. Note: A00 MCI has ICFs or IFLs only (zero CPs). Chapter 2.
