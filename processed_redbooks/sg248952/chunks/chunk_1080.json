An application type is whatever is necessary to do the job. The data reference pattern and processor usage tend to be inherent to the nature of the application. The LPAR configuration and application mix are mostly a function of what must be supported on a system. The I/O rate can be influenced somewhat through buffer pool tuning. However, one factor, software configuration tuning, is often overlooked but can have a direct effect on RNI. This term refers to the number of address spaces (such as CICS application-owning regions (AORs) or batch initiators) that are needed to support a workload. This factor always existed, but its sensitivity is higher",
