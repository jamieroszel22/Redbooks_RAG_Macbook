Moving the compression function from the (PCIe) I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations. Compression modes Compression is run in one of the following modes: \u0002 Synchronous Execution occurs in problem state where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space. \u0002 Asynchronous Execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution. This type of execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for authorized users of zEDC.
