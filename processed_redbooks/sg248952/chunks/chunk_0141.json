PU chip size is 532 mm2 (23.75 mm x 22.1 mm). Each CPC drawer has two or four PU DCMs with 22.5 Billion transistors each. The PU DCMs are shown in Figure 2-12. For both DCMs, a thermal cap is placed over the chips. Figure 2-12 Dual chip modules (PU DCM) under the heatsink There are two PU chips on each DCM, each DCM socket contains 4753 pins, and the module size is 71.5mm x 79mm. The DCMs are each plugged into a socket that is part of the CPC drawer packaging. Each PU DCM is air-cooled by using the front five CPC drawer fans, and a separate heat sink for every DCM. Air flow is from the front of the drawer to the rear. A schematic representation of the PU chip is shown in Figure 2-13 on page 38. 38 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Figure 2-13 PU chip floor plan The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ PU chip (two",
