After the offerings are installed on the BM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ SE, they can be activated at any time at the client\u2019s discretion. No intervention by IBM or IBM personnel is necessary. In addition, the activation of CBU does not require a password. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can have up to eight offerings installed at the same time, with the limitation that only one of them can be an On/Off CoD offering. The others can be any combination. The installed offerings can be activated fully or partially, and in any sequence and any combination. The offerings can be controlled manually through tasks on the HMC, or programmatically",
