FDR is designed to support the dynamic routing policies that are provided by the FICON director manufacturers; for example, Brocade\u2019s exchange-based routing (EBR) and Cisco\u2019s originator exchange ID (OxID)8 routing. A static SAN routing policy normally assigns the ISL routes according to the incoming port and its destination domain (port-based routing), or the source and destination ports pairing (device-based routing). The port-based routing (PBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d when a port starts a fabric login (FLOGI) to a destination domain. The ISL is round-robin that is selected for assignment. Therefore, I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination domain always is assigned the same ISL route, regardless of the destination port of each I/O. This setup can result in some ISLs overloaded while some are under-used. The ISL routing table is changed",
