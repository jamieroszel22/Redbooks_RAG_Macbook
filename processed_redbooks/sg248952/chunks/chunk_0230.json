The processor design features advanced micro-architectural innovations that provide the following benefits: \u0002 Maximized instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for a better cycles per instruction (CPI) design. \u0002 Maximized performance per watt. \u0002 Enhanced instruction dispatch and grouping efficiency. \u0002 Increased Out-of-Order) resources, such as Global Completion Table entries, physical GPR entries, and physical FPR entries. \u0002 Improved completion rate. \u0002 Reduced cache/TLB miss penalty. \u0002 Improved execution of D-Cache store and reload and new Fixed-point divide. \u0002 New Operand Store Compare (OSC) (load-hit-store conflict) avoidance scheme. \u0002 Enhanced branch prediction structure and sequential instruction fetching. Program results The Out-of-Order execution does not change any program results. Execution can occur out of (program) order, but all program dependencies are accepted, and the same results are seen as in-order (program) execution. The design was",
