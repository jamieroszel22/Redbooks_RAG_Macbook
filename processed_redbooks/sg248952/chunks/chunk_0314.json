  "content": "the assignment of logical processors and units of work. z/OS dispatcher manages multiple queues, called affinity queues, with a target number of eight processors per queue, which fits well onto a single PU chip. These queues are used to assign work to as few logical processors as are needed for an LPAR workload. Therefore, even if the LPAR is defined with many logical processors, HiperDispatch optimizes this number of processors to be near the required capacity. The optimal number of processors to be used is kept within a processor drawer boundary, when possible. Logical partitions PR/SM enables IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ to be initialized for a logically partitioned operation, supporting up to 40 LPARs. Each LPAR can run its own operating system image in any image mode, independently from the other LPARs. Tip: z/VM V7R1a and later also support HiperDispatch. a. z/VM 7.1 is NOT supported - z/VM 7.2 and later are supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. Chapter 3. Central processor",
