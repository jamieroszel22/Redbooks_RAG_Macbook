  "content": "printers, by using the following CHPID types: \u0002 CHPID type FC: The FICON, zHPF, and FCTC protocols are supported simultaneously. \u0002 CHPID type FCP: Fibre Channel Protocol that supports attachment to SCSI devices directly or through Fibre Channel switches or directors. FICON channels (CHPID type FC or FCP) can be shared among LPARs and defined as spanned. All ports on a FICON feature must be of the same type (LX or SX). The features are connected to a FICON capable control unit (point-to-point or switched point-to-point) through a Fibre Channel switch. FICON Express32S The FICON Express32S feature is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each of the two independent ports is capable of 8 Gbps, 16Gbps or 32 Gbps. The link speed depends on the capability of the attached switch or device. The link speed is auto-negotiated, point-to-point, and is transparent to users and applications. The following types of FICON Express32S optical transceivers are supported (no mix on same card): \u0002 FICON",
