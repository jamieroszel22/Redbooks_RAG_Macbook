  "content": "memory. An LPAR can dynamically take advantage of a memory upgrade if reserved storage is defined to that LPAR. The reserved storage is defined to the LPAR as part of the image profile. Reserved memory can be configured online to the LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (DSR) function. DSR allows a z/OS operating system image and z/VM partitions to add reserved storage to their configuration if any unused storage exists. The nondisruptive addition of storage to a z/OS and z/VM partition requires the correct operating system parameters to be set. If reserved storage is not defined to the LPAR, the LPAR must be deactivated, the image profile changed, and the LPAR reactivated. This process allows the extra storage resources to be available to the operating system image. Adding or changing physical memory for a single CPC drawer to an IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ is disruptive. 8.3.3 MES upgrades for I/O and CPC drawers MES upgrades for I/O can concurrently add more I/O",
