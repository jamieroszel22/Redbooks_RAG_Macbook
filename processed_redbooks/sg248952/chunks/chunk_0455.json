PCIe+ I/O Drawers contains and can host up to 16 PCIe I/O features (adapters). They are not supported on IBM z14 M0x or older zSystems. Also, the PCIe I/O drawer cannot be carried forward during and MES upgrade to IBM z14 ZR1 or newer. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, IBM z15 and IBM z14 ZR1 support ONLY PCIe+ I/O drawers. Chapter 4. I/O structure 181 Migration considerations Upgrading from previous generations of IBM Z in a Parallel Sysplex to IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ in that same Parallel Sysplex requires proper planning for coupling connectivity. Planning is important because of the change in the supported type of coupling link adapters and the number of",
