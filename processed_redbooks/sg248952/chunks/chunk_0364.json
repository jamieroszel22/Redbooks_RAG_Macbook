The Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand is not supported. \u2013 The 25GbE and 10GbE RoCE Express3, 25GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express2.1, 25GbE and 10GbE RoCE Express2 provide high-speed memory-to-memory data exchange to a remote CPC by using the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) protocol for TCP (socket-based) communications. The RoCE Express3 features can also provide local area network (LAN) connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. \u0002 Concurrent",
