  "content": "Central processor complex hardware components 67 The PDUs must support the following inputs (depending on system configuration): \u0002 3-phase 200 - 240 V AC (wired as \u201cDelta\u201d) \u0002 3-phase 380 - 415 V AC (wired as \u201cWye\u201d) \u0002 Single phase 200 - 240 V AC. The power supply units convert the AC power to DC power that is used as input for the Points of Load (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers. The power requirements depend on the number of CPC drawers (1 or 2), number of PCIe I/O drawers (0 - 3) and I/O features that are installed in the PCIe I/O drawers. Each PDU installed requires a customer supplied power feed. The number of power cords that are required depends on the system configuration. The 3932 operates from 2 or 4 power cords, which provide redundant attachment to the electrical utility. System components must be plugged into the PDUs for redundancy (using two power cords). See Table 2-15. Table 2-15 IBM A02 and AGZ Power Options For additional information refer to: 3932",
