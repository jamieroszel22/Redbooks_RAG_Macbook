  "content": "digital signatures, and certificates are used for authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation. When encrypting a message, the sender transforms the clear text into a secret text. Doing so requires the following main elements: \u0002 The algorithm is the mathematical or logical formula that is applied to the key and the clear text to deliver a ciphered result, or to take a ciphered text and deliver the original clear text. \u0002 The key ensures that the result of the encrypting data transformation by the algorithm is only the same when the same key is used. That decryption of a ciphered message results only in the original clear message when the correct key is used. Therefore, the receiver of a ciphered message must know which algorithm and key must be used to decrypt the message. 6.2.2 Kerckhoffs\u2019 principle In modern cryptography, the algorithm is published and known to everyone, whereas the keys are kept secret. This configuration corresponds to Kerckhoffs\u2019 principle, which is named",
