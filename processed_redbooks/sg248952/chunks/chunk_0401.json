  "content": "whenever IBM Z undergoes a power-on-reset (POR), so the ISL assignment is unpredictable. Device-based routing (DBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on a hash of the source and destination port. That I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination is assigned to same ISL route. Compared to PBR, the DBR is more capable of spreading the load across ISLs for I/O flow from the same incoming port to different destination ports within a destination domain. When a static SAN routing policy is used, the FICON director features limited capability to assign ISL routes based on workload. This limitation can result in unbalanced use of ISLs (some might be overloaded, while others are under-used). The dynamic routing ISL routes are dynamically changed based on the Fibre Channel exchange ID, which is unique for each I/O operation. ISL is assigned at I/O request time, so different I/Os from same incoming port to same destination port are assigned different ISLs. With FIDR, IBM",
