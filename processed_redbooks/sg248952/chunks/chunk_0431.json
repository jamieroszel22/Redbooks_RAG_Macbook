Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 25GbE switch or to the 25GbE RoCE Express2.1 feature on the attached server: \u0002 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 70 meters (229 feet). \u0002 OM4 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 4700 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 100 meters (328 feet). The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID). The 25GbE RoCE Express2.1 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. 10 GbE RoCE Express3 requirements: \u0002 The 10GbE RoCE Express3 LR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other",
