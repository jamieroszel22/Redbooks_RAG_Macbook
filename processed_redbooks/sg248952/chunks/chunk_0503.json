Also, the method can be more thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 6.2.3 Keys The keys that are used for the cryptographic algorithms often are sequences of numbers and characters, but can also be any other sequence of bits. The length of a key influences the security (strength) of the cryptographic method. The longer the used key, the more difficult it is to compromise a cryptographic algorithm. For example, the DES (symmetric key) algorithm uses keys with a length of 56 bits, Triple-DES (TDES) uses keys with a length of 112 bits, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses keys of 128, 192, 256, or 512 bits. The asymmetric key RSA algorithm (named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) uses keys with a length of 1024 - 4096 bits. 204 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide In modern cryptography, keys must be kept secret.
