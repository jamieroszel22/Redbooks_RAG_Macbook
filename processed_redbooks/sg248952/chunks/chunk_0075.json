The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are the latest in a long line of machines that are designed for system and data center energy efficiency with differentiated architectural advantages, including on-chip compression, and encryption designed to sustain 90% utilization along with new embedded on-chip AI acceleration to seamlessly integrate real-time AI insights into business-critical transactions. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ build on our more than 24-year history of improving the system performance per watt \u2013 a key metric for improving the data center carbon footprint. Beginning with the first CMOS mainframe processor and continuing through the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, IBM Z has a 27-year history of improved mainframe system capacity per watt. The biggest opportunity for energy savings with the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ comes",
