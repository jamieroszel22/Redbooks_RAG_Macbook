  "content": "drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly on L2 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O. Data compression is running in one of the two execution modes available: Synchronous mode or Asynchronous mode: \u0002 Synchronous execution occurs in problem states where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space. \u0002 Asynchronous execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM/QSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution. Asynchronous execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for existing authorized users of zEDC. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 89 The On-Chip data compression implements compression as defined by RFC1951 (DEFLATE). Figure 3-12 shows the nest compression accelerator (NXU) for On-Chip Compression acceleration. Figure 3-12 Integrated Accelerator for zEDC (NXU) on the IBM z16 A02 and",
