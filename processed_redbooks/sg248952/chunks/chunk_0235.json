  "content": "multi-issue architecture. However, when multiple instructions can be run during each cycle, the level of complexity is increased because an operation in one pipeline stage might depend on data in another pipeline stage. Therefore, a superscalar design demands careful consideration of which instruction sequences can successfully operate in a long pipeline environment. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are superscalar processors. Each processor unit, or core, is a superscalar and out-of-order processor that supports 10 concurrent issues to execution units in a single CPU cycle: \u0002 Fixed-point unit (FXU): The FXU handles fixed-point arithmetic. \u0002 Load-store unit (LSU): The LSU contains the data cache. It is responsible for handling all types of operand accesses of all lengths, modes, and formats as defined in the z/Architecture. \u0002 Instruction fetch and branch (IFB) (prediction) and Instruction cache and merge (ICM). These two sub units (IFB and ICM) contain the instruction cache, branch",
