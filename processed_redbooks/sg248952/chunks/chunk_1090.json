Hiperdispatch optimizes processor cache usage by creating an affinity between a PU and the workload. \u0002 Assign an appropriate number of logical CPs. If you assign too many logical CPs to the LPAR, unnecessary LPAR management cost is exhausted. This issue reduces the efficiency of the cache. The capacity declines relative to the LCP:RCP ratio (sum of logical CPs defined in all LPARs: the number of physical CPs on your configuration). Therefore, assigning the correct number of CPU to LPAR is important. If your",
