  "content": "isolated. QDIO interface isolation is supported on all OSA-Express features on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. QDIO optimized latency mode QDIO optimized latency mode (OLM) can help improve performance for applications that feature a critical requirement to minimize response times for inbound and outbound data. OLM optimizes the interrupt processing in the following manner: \u0002 For inbound processing, the TCP/IP stack looks more frequently for available data to process. This process ensures that any new data is read from the OSA-Express features without needing more program controlled interrupts (PCIs). \u0002 For outbound processing, the OSA-Express cards also look more frequently for available data to process from the TCP/IP stack. Therefore, the process does not require a Signal Adapter (SIGA) instruction to determine whether more data is available. The supported operating systems are listed in",
