IBM z16 A01, IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are the industry-first quantum-safe system, which is protected by quantum-safe technology across multiple layers of firmware. Quantum-safe secure boot technology helps protect IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ firmware from quantum attacks through a built-in dual signature scheme with no configuration changes that are required for enablement. With the new Crypto Express8S, IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ help deliver quantum-safe APIs that position businesses to begin the use of quantum-safe cryptography along with classical cryptography as they begin modernizing applications and building new applications. Discovering where and what kind of cryptography is being used is a key first step along the journey to quantum-safety. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ provide instrumentation that can be used to track cryptographic instruction execution in the CP Assist for",
