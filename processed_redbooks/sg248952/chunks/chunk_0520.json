  "content": "for cryptographic services. CPACF supports pervasive encryption. Simple policy controls allow businesses to enable encryption to protect data in mission-critical databases without the need to stop the database or re-create database objects. Pervasive encryption includes z/OS Dataset Encryption, z/OS Coupling Facility Encryption, z/VM encrypted hypervisor paging, and z/TPF transparent database encryption, which use performance enhancements in the hardware. The CPACF offers a set of symmetric cryptographic functions that enhances the encryption and decryption performance of clear key operations. These functions are for SSL, virtual private network (VPN), and data-storing applications that do not require FIPS 140 Level 4 security. CPACF is designed to facilitate the privacy of cryptographic key material when used for data encryption through key wrapping implementation. It ensures that key material is not visible to applications or operating systems during encryption operations. For more",
