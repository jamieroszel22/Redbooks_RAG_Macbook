  "content": "to run in an SMT environment, as shown in Figure 7-1. Figure 7-1 Simultaneous multithreading z/OS The use of SMT on z/OS requires enabling HiperDispatch, and defining the processor view (PROCVIEW) control statement in the LOADxx parmlib member and the MT_ZIIP_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx parmlib member. The PROCVIEW statement is defined for the life of IPL, and can have the following values: \u0002 CORE: This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core, in which a core can include one or more threads. The number of threads is limited by IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ to two threads. If the underlying hardware does not support SMT, a core is limited to one thread. \u0002 CPU: This value is the default. It specifies that z/OS should configure a traditional processor view of CPU and not use SMT. \u0002 CORE,CPU_OK: This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core (as with the CORE value) but the CPU parameter is accepted as an alias for applicable",
