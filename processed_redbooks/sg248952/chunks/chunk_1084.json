As described in 12.5, \u201cLSPR workload categories based on RNI\u201d on page 462, the underlying performance sensitive factor is how a workload interacts with the processor hardware. 12.7 CPU MF counter data and LSPR workload type Beginning with the z10 processor, the hardware characteristics can be measured by using CPU MF (SMF 113) counters data. A production workload can be matched to an LSPR workload category through these hardware characteristics. For more information about RNI, see 12.5, \u201cLSPR workload categories based on RNI\u201d on page 462. The AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload is intended to match most client workloads. When no other data is available, use the AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload for capacity analysis. Low-Average and Average-High categories allow better granularity for workload characterization but these categories can apply on zPCR only. 464 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide The CPU MF data can be used determine workload type.
