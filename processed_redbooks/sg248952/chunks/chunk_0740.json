Removal of support for OSA-Express 1000BASE-T hardware adaptersa: IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are planned to be the last IBM Z to support OSA-Express 1000BASE-T hardware adapters (FC 0426, 0446, and 0458) on new build servers. Definition of all valid OSA CHPID types will be allowed only on OSA-Express GbE adapters. IBM plans to continue moving forward with OSA CHPID types on higher bandwidth fiber Ethernet adapters on future servers. a. Statements by IBM regarding its plans, directions, and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice at the sole discretion of IBM. Note: OSA-ICC supports up to 48 secure sessions per CHPID (the overall maximum of 120 connections is unchanged). Chapter 7.
