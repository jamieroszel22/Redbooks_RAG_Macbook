  "content": "out of program order and memory address generation and memory accesses can also occur out of program order. Each core includes special circuitry to display execution and memory accesses in order to the software. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ superscalar PU core can have up to 10 instructions or operations that are running per cycle. This technology results in shorter workload runtime. Enhanced branch prediction If the branch prediction logic of the microprocessor makes the wrong prediction, all instructions in the parallel pipelines are removed. The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible. For this reason, various history-based branch prediction mechanisms are used, as shown in the in-order part of the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ PU core logical diagram in Figure 3-11. The branch target buffer (BTB) runs ahead of instruction cache",
