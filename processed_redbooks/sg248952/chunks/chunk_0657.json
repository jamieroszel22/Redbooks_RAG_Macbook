RMF is updated to support this change by implementing page break support in the I/O Queuing Activity report that is generated by the RMF Post processor. z/VM V7R3 and V7R2 The use of SMT in z/VM is enabled by using the MULTITHREADING statement in the system configuration file. Multithreading is enabled only if z/VM is configured to run with the HiperDispatch vertical polarization mode enabled and with the dispatcher work distribution mode set to reshuffle. The default in z/VM is multithreading disabled. Dynamic SMT enables dynamically varying the active threads per core. The number of active threads per core can be changed dynamically without a system outage and potential capacity gains going from SMT-1 to SMT-2 (one to two threads per core) can be achieved dynamically. z/VM V7R3 and V7R2 support up to 40 multithreaded cores (80",
