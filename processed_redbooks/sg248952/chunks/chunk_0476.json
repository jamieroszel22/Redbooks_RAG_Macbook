CPC drawer repair: The HSA can be moved from one CPC drawer to the additional CPC drawer, if available, in an enhanced availability configuration as part of a concurrent CPC drawer repair (CDR) action (available only on Max68 feature). Note: The phrase channel subsystem has same meaning as logical channel subsystem in this section, unless otherwise stated. 190 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide A subchannel set (SS) is a collection of subchannels within a channel subsystem. The maximum number of subchannels of a subchannel set determines how many devices are accessible to a channel subsystem. In z/Architecture, the first subchannel set of an LCSS can have 63.75 K subchannels (with 0.25 K reserved), with a subchannel set ID (SSID) of 0. By enabling the multiple subchannel sets, extra subchannel sets are available to increase the device addressability of a channel subsystem. For more information about multiple subchannel sets, see 5.1.2, \u201cMultiple",
