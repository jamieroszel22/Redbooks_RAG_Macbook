  "content": "key and private key cryptographic operations that are used with SSL/TLS processing. For more information, see 6.5.4, \u201cCrypto Express8S as an accelerator\u201d on page 226. These modes can be configured by using the SE. The PCIe adapter must be configured offline to change the mode. The Crypto Express8S feature is released for enhanced cryptographic performance. Clients who migrated to variable-length AES key tokens cannot take advantage of faster encryption speeds by using CPACF. Support is being added to translate a secure variable-length AES CIPHER token to a protected key token (protected by the system wrapping key). This support allows for faster AES encryption speeds when variable-length tokens are used while maintaining strong levels of security. The Crypto Express8S feature does not include external ports and does not use optical fiber or other cables. It does not use channel path identifiers (CHPIDs), but requires one slot in the PCIe I/O drawer and one physical channel ID (PCHID)",
