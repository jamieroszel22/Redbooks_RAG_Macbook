  "content": "Interface (OMI) with up to 6 OMI per drawer, has CRC/Retry for soft errors, degrade bus lanes 4->2 on hard error, and no waiting for all eight cards (use first seven to respond) A precise marking of faulty chips helps ensure timely DIMM replacements. The design of the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ further improved this chip marking technology. Graduated DRAM marking is available, and channel marking and scrubbing calls for replacement on the third DRAM failure is available. For more information about the memory system on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, see 2.5, \u201cMemory\u201d on page 43. \u0002 Soft-switch firmware IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ is equipped with the capabilities of soft-switching firmware. Enhanced logic in this function ensures that every affected circuit is powered off during the soft-switching of firmware components. For example, when you are upgrading the microcode of a FICON feature, enhancements are implemented to avoid any unwanted side effects that were detected on previous",
