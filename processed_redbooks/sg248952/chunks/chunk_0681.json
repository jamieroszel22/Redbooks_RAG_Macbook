  "content": "and when that deactivation ever occurs). During path initialization, the CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active, including the SYID for the path. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness, and if incorrect, gather diagnostic information and reactivates the path to correct the problem. \u0002 CF monopolization avoidance z/OS will take advantage of current CF support in CFLEVEL 24 (IBM z15 T01/T02) to deliver improved z/OS support for handling CF monopolization. With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher will monitor in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a given structure, on a structure-by-structure basis. When the number of CF tasks being used by any given structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks is also exceeded, the structure will be considered to be",
