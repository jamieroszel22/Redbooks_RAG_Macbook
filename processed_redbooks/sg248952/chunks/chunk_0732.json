  "content": "For flexible and efficient data transfer for IP and non-IP workloads, the HiperSockets internal networks on IBM Z servers can support two transport modes: Layer 2 (Link Layer) and the current Layer 3 (Network or IP Layer). Traffic can be Internet Protocol (IP) Version 4 or Version 6 (IPv4, IPv6) or non-IP (AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA). HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device features its own Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) address. This 296 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide MAC address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of Layer 2 addresses, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers and firewalls. Layer 2 support can help facilitate server consolidation. Complexity can be reduced, network configuration is simplified and intuitive, and LAN administrators can configure and maintain the mainframe environment the same way as they do a non-mainframe environment.
