  "content": "hypervisor support, which removes the virtualization layer (sharing the zEDC Express PCIe adapter among LPARs requires virtualization support). \u0002 Asynchronous optimization for Large Operations under z/OS. The authorized application (for example, BSAM/QSAM) issues I/O for asynchronous execution and SAP (PU) starts instruction (synchronously as described in the previous paragraph) on behalf of application. The on-chip accelerator enables load balancing of high compression loads and low latency and high bandwidth compared to zEDC Express, while maintaining current user experience on compression. Functionality support for the IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC is listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. For more information, see Appendix C, \u201cIBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression\u201d on page 477. 7.4.3 Coupling and clustering features and functions In this section, we describe the coupling and cluster features.
