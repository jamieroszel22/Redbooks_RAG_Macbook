IOCP does not need to configure a server that is running in DPM mode. For more information, see IBM Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) Guide, SB10-7182. Chapter 7. Operating system support 265 PR/SM on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ preferentially assigns memory for a system in one CPC drawer that is striped across the DCMs of that drawer to take advantage of the lower latency memory access in a drawer. Also, PR/SM tries to consolidate storage onto drawers with the most processor entitlement. With HiperDispatch enabled, PR/SM seeks to assign logical processors of a partition to the smallest number of PU chips within a drawer in cooperation with operating system to optimize shared cache usage. PR/SM automatically keeps a partition\u2019s memory and logical processors on the same CPC drawer where possible. This arrangement looks simple for a partition, but",
