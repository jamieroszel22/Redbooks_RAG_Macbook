  "content": "a second CBU record is added to the configuration for two CP CBUs, two IFL CBUs, and two zIIP CBUs, with five more tests and a five-year CBU contract. The result is that a total number of 10 years of CBU ordered: Five years in the first record and five years in the second record. The two CBU records are independent and can be activated individually. Five more CBU tests were requested. Because a total of five years are contracted for a total of three CP CBUs (two IFL CBUs and two zIIP CBUs), they are shown as 15, 10, 10, and 10 CBU years for their respective types.
