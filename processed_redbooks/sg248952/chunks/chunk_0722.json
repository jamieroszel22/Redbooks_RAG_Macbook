Support for select Linux on IBM Z distributions is provided for Shared Memory Communications over Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R) by using RoCE Express features. For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page. The RoCE Express3 features can also provide local area network (LAN) connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. Note: An optional feature can be ordered for WWPN persistency before shipment to keep the same I/O serial number on the new CPC. Current information must be provided during the ordering process.
