The CPD is shown in Figure 8-11. Figure 8-11 Capacity Provisioning Domain The CPD configuration defines the CPCs and z/OS systems that are controlled by an instance of the CPM. One or more CPCs, sysplexes, and z/OS systems can be defined into a domain. Although sysplexes and CPCs do not have to be contained in a domain, they must not belong to more than one domain. Each domain has one active capacity provisioning policy. CPM operates in the following modes, which allows four different levels of automation: \u0002 Manual mode Use this command-driven mode when no CPM policy is active. \u0002 Analysis mode In analysis mode, CPM processes capacity-provisioning policies and informs the operator when a provisioning or deprovisioning action is required according to policy",
