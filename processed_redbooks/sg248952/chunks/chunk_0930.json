After you stop these non-critical LPARs and free their resources, you might find sufficient inactive resources to contain critical workloads while completing a drawer replacement. 9.8.1 EDA planning considerations To use the EDA function, configure enough physical memory and engines so that the loss of a single drawer does not result in any degradation to critical workloads during the following occurrences: \u0002 A degraded restart in the rare event of a drawer failure \u0002 A drawer replacement for repair or a physical memory upgrade The following configurations especially enable the use of the EDA function. These IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ features need enough spare capacity so that they can cover the resources of a fenced or isolated drawer. This configuration imposes limits on the following number of the client-owned PUs that can be activated when one CPC drawer is fenced: \u0002 A maximum of 68 PUs are configured on the Max68. \u0002 No special",
