Querying and displaying an OSA configuration OSA-Express3 introduced the capability for the operating system to query and display directly the current OSA configuration information (similar to OSA/SF). z/OS uses this OSA capability by introducing the TCP/IP operator command display OSAINFO. z/VM provides this function with the NETSTAT OSAINFO TCP/IP command. The use of display OSAINFO (z/OS) or NETSTAT OSAINFO (z/VM) allows the operator to monitor and verify the current OSA configuration and helps improve the overall management, serviceability, and usability of OSA-Express cards. 300 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide These commands apply to CHPID type OSD. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255. QDIO data connection isolation for z/VM The QDIO data connection isolation function provides a higher level of security when sharing an OSA connection in z/VM environments that use VSWITCH.",
