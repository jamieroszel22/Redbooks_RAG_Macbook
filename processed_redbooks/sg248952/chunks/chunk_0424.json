  "content": "25GbE RoCE Express3 SR (FC 0452) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and is supported only on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The 25GbE RoCE Express3 SR is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID and is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD).The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 100 meters (328 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 25GbE switch or to another 25GbE RoCE Express3 SR feature: \u0002 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 70 meters (229 feet) \u0002 OM4 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 4700 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 100 meters (328 feet) The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID).
