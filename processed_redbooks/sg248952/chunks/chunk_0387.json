I/O structure 155 At least one I/O feature (FICON) or one coupling link feature (ICA SR or CE LR) must be present in the minimum configuration. The following features can be shared and spanned: \u0002 FICON channels that are defined as FC or FCP \u0002 OSA-Express features that are defined as OSC, OSD, or OSE \u0002 Coupling links that are defined as CS5 or CL5 \u0002 HiperSockets that are defined as IQD The following features are plugged into a PCIe+ I/O drawer and do not require the definition of a CHPID and CHPID type: \u0002 Each Crypto Express (8S/7S/6S) feature occupies one I/O",
