Support in select Linux on IBM Z distributions is now provided for Shared Memory Communications over Direct Memory Access (SMC-D). For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. Shared Memory Communications Version 2 Shared Memory Communications v2 is available in z/OS V2R4 (with PTFs) and z/OS V2R5. The initial version of SMC was limited to TCP/IP connections over the same layer 2 network and therefore was not routable across multiple IP subnets. The associated TCP/IP connection was limited to hosts within a single IP subnet requiring the hosts to have direct access to the same physical layer 2 network (i.e. same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet. SMC Version 2",
