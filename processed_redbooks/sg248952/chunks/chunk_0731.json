  "content": "between two LPARs. Multiple output buffers are supported on a single Signal Adapter (SIGA) write instruction. The key advantage of this enhancement is that it allows the receiving LPAR to process a much larger amount of data per I/O interrupt. This process is transparent to the operating system in the receiving partition. HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility with fewer I/O interrupts is designed to reduce processor utilization of the sending and receiving partitions. Support for this function is required by the sending operating system. For more information, see \u201cHiperSockets\u201d on page 175. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255. HiperSockets support of IPV6 IPv6 is a key element in the future of networking. The IPv6 support for HiperSockets allows compatible implementations between external networks and internal HiperSockets networks. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. HiperSockets Layer 2 support",
