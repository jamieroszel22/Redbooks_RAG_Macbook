This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password. The secret key is generated by HMC/SE/TKE while the user is performing first factor logon. The secret key is known only to HMC/SE/TKE and to the user\u2019s smartphone.
