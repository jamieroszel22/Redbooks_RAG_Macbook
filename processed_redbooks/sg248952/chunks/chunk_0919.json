Preventing unscheduled, scheduled, and planned outages was addressed by the IBM Z system design for many years. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ and IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ systems have a fixed size HSA of 160 GB. This size helps eliminate pre-planning requirements for HSA and provides the flexibility to update dynamically the configuration. You can perform the following tasks dynamically:4 \u0002 Add a logical partition (LPAR) \u0002 Add a logical channel subsystem (LCSS) \u0002 Add a subchannel set \u0002 Add a logical PU to an LPAR \u0002 Add a cryptographic coprocessor \u0002 Remove a cryptographic coprocessor \u0002 Enable I/O connections \u0002 Swap processor types \u0002 Add memory 4 Some pre-planning considerations might exist. For more information, see Chapter 8, \u201cSystem upgrades\u201d on page 319. Chapter 9. Reliability, availability, and serviceability 377 \u0002 Add a physical",
