The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express5S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity. Each adapter can be configured in the following modes: \u0002 QDIO mode, with CHPID types OSD \u0002 Non-QDIO mode, with CHPID type OSE \u0002 Local 3270 emulation mode, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. OSA-Integrated Console Controller The OSA-Express 1000BASE-T Ethernet features provide the Integrated Console Controller (OSA-ICC) function, which supports TN3270E (RFC 2355) and non-SNA DFT 3270 emulation. The OSA-ICC function is defined as CHPID type OSC and console controller, and includes multiple LPAR support as shared or spanned channels. With the OSA-ICC function, 3270 emulation for console session connections is integrated in the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ through",
