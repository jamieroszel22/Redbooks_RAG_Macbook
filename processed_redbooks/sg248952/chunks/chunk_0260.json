The execution is optimistic. The instructions are run, but previous state values are saved in a transactional memory. If the transaction succeeds, the saved values are discarded; otherwise, they are used to restore the original values. The Transaction Execution Facility provides instructions, including declaring the beginning and end of a transaction, and canceling the transaction. TX is expected to provide significant performance benefits and scalability by avoiding most locks.",
