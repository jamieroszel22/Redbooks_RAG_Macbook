SMT was enhanced for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ and it is enabled for SAPs by default (no customer intervention required). Introduced in z/OS V2R4, the z/OS Container Extensions11 allows deployment of Linux on IBM Z software components, such as Docker Containers in a z/OS system, in direct support of z/OS workloads without requiring a separately provisioned Linux server. It also maintains overall solution operational control within z/OS and with z/OS qualities of service. Workload deployed in z/OS Container Extensions is zIIP eligible. 10 IBM Z Application Assist Processors (zAAPs) are not available since IBM z14. A zAAP workload is dispatched to available zIIPs (zAAP on zIIP capability). Tip: Starting with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ announcement, the 2:1 zIIP:CP ratio restriction has been removed. With one CP ordered, the number of zIIPs orderable is now (MaxYY-1). The restriction has been",
