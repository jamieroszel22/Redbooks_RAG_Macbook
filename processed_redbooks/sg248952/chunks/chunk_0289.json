  "content": "characterized as zIIPs within a configuration are grouped into the zIIP pool. This configuration allows zIIPs to have their own processing weights, independent of the weight of parent CPs. The zIIP pool can be seen on the hardware console. The number of permanent zIIPs plus temporary zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs plus temporary CPs. Also, the number of temporary zIIPs cannot exceed the number of permanent zIIPs. Features Max5 Max16 Max32 Max68 Maximum of zIIPs FC 1961 4 15 31 67 Maximum of Unassigned zIIPs FC 1975a a. The numbers for FC 1961 and 1975 are based on one active CP in the configuration. The maximun number of Unassigned zIIPs decreases by the number of active zIIPs and active CPs. 3 15 31 67 Note: Starting with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ announcement, the 2:1 zIIP:CP ratio restriction has been removed. With one CP ordered, the number of zIIPs orderable is now (MaxYY-1). The restriction has been lifted for IBM z16 A02, IBM16 AGZ and IBM z16 A01 as",
