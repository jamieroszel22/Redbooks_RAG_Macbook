Figure 3-7 Point-to-point topology with a systems with two CPC drawers Inter-CPC drawer communication occurs at the Level 4 virtual cache level, which is implemented on the semi-private part of one of the Level 2 caches in a chip module. The Level 4 cache function regulates coherent drawer-to-drawer traffic. 3.4 Processor unit design Processor cycle time is especially important for processor-intensive applications. Current systems design is driven by processor cycle time, although improved cycle time does not automatically mean that the performance characteristics of the system improve. Chapter 3.
