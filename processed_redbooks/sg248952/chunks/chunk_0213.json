  "content": "processing complex (CPC) drawer add and repair.4 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ processors are manufactured using 7 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) FinFET silicon technology with advanced low latency pipeline design, which creates high-speed yet power-efficient circuit designs. The PU DCMs are air-cooled. For more information, see 2.9, \u201cPower and cooling\u201d on page 65. 4 Repair only for configurations with two CPC drawers installed. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 77 3.3.1 Cache levels and memory structure The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ include a new optimized memory subsystem design that focuses on keeping data closer to the PU core. With the current processor configuration, all on-chip cache levels increased. The cache hierarchy is shown in Figure 3-3. Figure 3-3 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ cache levels and memory hierarchy The cache structure of the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ features the following characteristics: \u0002 Large L1, L2 caches (more data closer to the core). \u0002 L1",
