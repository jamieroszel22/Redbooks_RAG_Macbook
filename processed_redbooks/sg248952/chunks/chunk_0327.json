  "content": "reassignment can swap client processors of different types between processor drawers21. For example, reassignment can swap an IFL on processor drawer 0 with a CP on processor drawer 2. Swaps can also occur between PU chips within a processor drawer or a DCM and can include spare PUs. The goals are to pack the LPAR on fewer Partition profile: Cryptographic coprocessors are not tied to partition numbers or MIF IDs. They are set up with Adjunct Processor (AP) numbers and domain indexes. These numbers are assigned to a partition profile of a given name. The client assigns these AP numbers and domains to the partitions and continues to have the responsibility to clear them out when their profiles change. 20 In z/OS, this support is available since Version 1 Release 10 (z/OS V1.10), while z/VM supports this addition since z/VM V5.4, and z/VSE since V4.3. However, z16 A02 and z16 AGZ support z/OS V2R2 and later, 21CS VSEn V6R3 and z/VM V7R1 or later, and do not support z/VSE. 21 Applicable",
