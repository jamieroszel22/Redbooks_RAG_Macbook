The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ supports the following timing information synchronization protocols: \u0002 Network Time Protocol (NTP) \u0002 Network Time protocol w/ Pulse Per Second (PPS) \u0002 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) \u0002 Precision Time Protocol w/ Pulse Per Second With IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, the STP External Time Source connects directly to the CPC (dedicated LAN ports) through the OSC card. This is different from the previous IBM Z where the Support Element was connected to the External Time Source For additional information about Server Time Protocol, see the Redbook IBM Z Server Time Protocol Guide, SG24-8480. Consider the following points: \u0002 A new card that combines the BMC and OSC is implemented with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. Internally, the physical cards (BMC and OSC) are separated but incorporated as a",
