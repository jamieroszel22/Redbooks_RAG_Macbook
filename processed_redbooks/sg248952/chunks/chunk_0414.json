  "content": "The OSA-Express7S 1.2 25GbE LR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only. A 9 \u00b5m single-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting this feature to the selected device. OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE LR (FC 0456) The OSA-Express7S 1.2 10Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) Long Reach (LR) feature includes one PCIe Gen3 adapter and one port per feature. The port supports CHPID types OSD. The 10GbE feature is designed to support attachment to a single-mode fiber 10Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 10Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and can be shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE LR feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device includes an LR transceiver. The transceivers at both ends must be the same (LR to LR). The",
