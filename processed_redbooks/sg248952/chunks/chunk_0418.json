The RJ-45 receptacle is required to be attached by using an EIA/TIA Category 5 or Category 6 UTP cable with a maximum length of 100 meters (328 feet). The SFP allows a concurrent repair or replace action. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature does not support auto-negotiation. It supports links at 1000 Mbps in full duplex mode only. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE. OSA-Express6S The OSA-Express6S feature is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. The following OSA-Express6S features can be installed on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ (when carried forward): \u0002 OSA-Express6S 10 Gigabit Ethernet LR, FC 0424 \u0002 OSA-Express6S 10 Gigabit Ethernet SR, FC 0425 \u0002 OSA-Express6S Gigabit Ethernet LX, FC 0422 \u0002 OSA-Express6S Gigabit Ethernet SX, FC 0423",
