Cryptographic features 201 6.1 Cryptography enhancements on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ introduced the new PCIe Crypto Express8S feature, together with a further improved CPACF Coprocessor, that can be managed by a new Trusted Key Entry (TKE) workstation. In addition, the IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) and the IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) Licensed Internal Code (LIC) were enhanced. The functions support new standards and are designed to meet the following compliance requirements: \u0002 Payment Card Industry (PCI) Hardware Security Module (HSM) certification to strength the cryptographic standards for attack resistance in the payment card systems area. PCI HSM certification is exclusive for Crypto Express7S and Crypto Express6S. \u0002 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)",
