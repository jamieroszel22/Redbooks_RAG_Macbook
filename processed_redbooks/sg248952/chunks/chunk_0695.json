Operating system support 283 The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 252 and Table 7-7 on page 253. Extended distance FICON An enhancement to the industry-standard FICON architecture (FC-SB-3) helps avoid degradation of performance at extended distances by implementing a new protocol for persistent IU pacing. Extended distance FICON is transparent to operating systems and applies to all FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features that carry native FICON traffic (CHPID type FC). To use this enhancement, the control unit must support the new IU pacing protocol. IBM System Storage\u2122 DS8000 series supports extended distance FICON for IBM Z environments. The channel defaults to current pacing values when it operates with control units that cannot use extended distance FICON. High-performance FICON",
