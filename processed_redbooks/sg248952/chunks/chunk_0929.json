This procedure has no effect on the running workload5. The EDA procedure and careful planning help ensure that all the resources are still available to run critical applications in an (n-1) drawer configuration. This process allows you to avoid planned outages. Consider the flexible memory option to provide more memory resources when you are replacing a drawer. To minimize the effect on current workloads, ensure that sufficient inactive physical resources exist on the remaining drawers to complete a drawer removal. Also, consider deactivating non-critical",
