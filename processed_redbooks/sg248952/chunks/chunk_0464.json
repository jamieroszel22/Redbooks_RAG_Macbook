  "content": "cryptographic processing as required by banking and other industries. This feature provides a secure programming and hardware environment wherein crypto processes are performed. Each cryptographic coprocessor includes general-purpose processors, non-volatile storage, and specialized cryptographic electronics, which are all contained within a tamper-sensing and tamper-responsive enclosure that eliminates all keys and sensitive data on any attempt to tamper with the device. The security features of the HSM are designed to meet the requirements of FIPS 140, Level 4, which is the highest security level defined. The Crypto Express7S (2 port), FC 0898 includes two IBM PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessors (PCIeCC) per feature. The IBM PCIeCC is a hardware security module (HSM). The Crypto Express7S (1 port), FC 0899 includes one IBM PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessors (PCIeCC) per feature. For availability reasons, a minimum of two features is required for the one port feature.
