For most current support, see the Linux on IBM Z Tested platforms website. Chapter 7. Operating system support 271 Single-instruction multiple-data The SIMD feature introduces a new set of instructions to enable parallel computing that can accelerate code with string, character, integer, and floating point data types. The SIMD instructions allow a large number of operands to be processed with a single complex instruction. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are equipped with a set of instructions to improve the performance of complex mathematical models and analytic workloads through vector processing and complex instructions, which can process numerous data with a single instruction. This set of instructions, which is",
