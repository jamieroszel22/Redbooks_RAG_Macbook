It means more workload can be executed by IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ in the same time window than IBM z15 T02 when using SMT. 12.1.3 IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression Starting with z13, IBM introduced the zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) Express PCIe feature, bringing efficiency and economies for data storing and data transfers. The zEDC Express feature was adopted by enterprises because it helps with software costs for compression/decompression operations (by offloading these operations), and increases data encryption (compression before encryption) efficiency. With z15, the zEDC Express functionality was moved off from the PCIe infrastructure into the processor nest. By moving the compression and decompression into the processor nest (on-chip), IBM z15 processor provides a new level of",
