On an IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ, the HMA feature, RCL can be scheduled to update both HMCs and the firmware will automatically manage Alternate SE switches to ensure each HMC can be updated without the Primary SE being present. In general you first have to generate a token on the HMC task Manage Remote Firmware Updates. Afterwards you can schedule a RCL on Resource Link -> Fixes -> Licensed internal code -> Remote Code Load request. Important to understand is, that for IBM Z, IBM support will not connect to your IBM Z from outside to do the RCL. The RCL is managed on your HMC.
