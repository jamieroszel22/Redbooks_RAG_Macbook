For more information about TKE hardware support, see Table 6-3 on page 233. For some functionality, requirements must be considered; for example, the characterization of a Crypto Express adapter in EP 11 mode always requires the use of a TKE. Note: Several options for ordering the TKE with or without ordering Keyboard, Mouse, and Display are available. Ask your IBM Representative for more information about which option is the best option for you. 8 TKE 8.x can be upgraded to TKE 10.0 in a limited number of cases. Please verify possibilities in e-Config. Note: If your IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ includes Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S, you can use TKE V9.2, which requires the 4768 cryptographic adapter.
