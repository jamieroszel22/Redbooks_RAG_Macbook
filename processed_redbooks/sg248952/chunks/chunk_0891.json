This data is key to the functioning of CoD offerings. Figure 8-16 Format of system-information block (SYSIB) The model capacity identifier contains the base capacity, On/Off CoD, and CBU. The Model Permanent Capacity Identifier and the Model Permanent Capacity Rating contain the base capacity of the system. The Model Temporary Capacity Identifier and Model Temporary Capacity Rating contain the base capacity and On/Off CoD.
