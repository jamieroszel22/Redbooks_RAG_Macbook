Chapter 2. Central processor complex hardware components 41 2.3.3 Cache level structure The cache structure comparison between CPC drawers on z16 and z15 is shown in Figure 2-15. Figure 2-15 Cache structure comparison: z16 versus z15 2.4 PCIe+ I/O drawer PCIe Generations The z16 uses PCIe Generation 4 (Sextupled Data Rate - XDR), Generation 3 (Quadruple Data Rate - QDR), Generation 2 (Double Data Rate - DDR) and Generation 1, (Single Data Rate - SDR). XDR is used between the CP-DCM and the fanout card. QDR is used between CEC drawer and PCIe I/O drawer with a width of 16 Lanes. Both connections",
