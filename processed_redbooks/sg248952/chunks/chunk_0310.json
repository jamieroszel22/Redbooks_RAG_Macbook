No application changes are required to change from IBM Flash Express to VFM. For IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, up to 2.0 TB of virtual flash memory can be ordered, in 512 GB increments. The minimum is 0, while the maximum is 4 features. The number of VFM features ordered reduces the maximum orderable memory for the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. 3.7 Logical partitioning The logical partitioning features are described in this section. 3.7.1 Overview Logical partitioning is a function that is implemented by the PR/SM on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can run in LPAR mode, or in",
