  "content": "changes that are being made for a new system, or a system upgrade, and what the target configuration looks like. \u0002 Hardware configuration definition (HCD) HCD supplies an interactive dialog to generate the IODF, and later the IOCDS. Generally, use HCD or Hardware Configuration Manager (HCM) to generate the I/O configuration rather than writing I/O configuration program (IOCP) statements. The validation checking that HCD runs against a IODF source file helps minimize the risk of errors before an I/O configuration is activated. HCD support for multiple channel subsystems is available with z/VM and z/OS. HCD provides the capability to make dynamic hardware and software I/O configuration changes.
