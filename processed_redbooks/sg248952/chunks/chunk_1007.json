  "content": "Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM) must manage LPAR access to processors and the initial weights of each partition, weights are used to prioritize partition access to processors. You can use the Load task on the HMC to perform an IPL of an operating system. This task causes a program to be read from a designated device, and starts that program. You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server. When an LPAR is active and an operating system is running in it, you can use the HMC to dynamically change certain LPAR parameters. The HMC provides an interface to change partition weights, add logical processors to partitions, and add memory. Channel paths can be dynamically configured on and off (as needed for each partition) from an HMC. 10.5.3 HMC and SE remote operations As stand-alone, outside the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ HMCs (tower or rack mount) can no longer be ordered, most of you will connect to the HMC (and SE) via a",
