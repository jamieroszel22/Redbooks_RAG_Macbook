ECC can be used for encryption, pseudo-random number generation, and digital certificates. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) Prime/NIST method is used for ECC digital signatures, which are recommended for government use by NIST. \u0002 ECDSA (160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and 512 BrainPool): ECC BrainPool is a workgroup of companies and institutions that collaborate on developing ECC algorithms. The ECDSA algorithms that are recommended by this group are supported. \u0002 ECDH (192, 224, 256, 384, and 521 Prime/NIST): Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is an asymmetric protocol that is used for key agreement between two parties by using ECC-based private keys. The recommendations by NIST are supported. \u0002 ECDH (160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and 512 BrainPool): ECDH",
