The machine at Site A has the base capacity configured at the same level as the high water mark of the Site B machine and has flex capacity activated to its HWM. The flex capacity is then added to the machine at Site B, bringing it up to the Site A HWM and workload is transferred. Once all workload has been transferred (within 24 hours) the capacity of the Site A machine is reduced to the base level. Workload can continue to run at Site B for up to a year. Figure 8-13 Flexible Capacity Normal Operation Capacity transfer is shown in Figure 8-14. Flexible Capacity Record is ACTIVE in both sites for up to 24 hours. Figure 8-14 Flexible Capacity record at Site B is activated and workload transferred After the site swap (capacity active in both sites for up to 24 hours), workload can stay in Site B for up to one year. (see Figure 8-15 on page 357). Chapter 8. System upgrades 357 Figure 8-15 Swap and stay at Site B for up to 1 year For more",
