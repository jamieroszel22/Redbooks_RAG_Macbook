Subcapacity models provide for CP capacity increase in two dimensions that can be used together to deliver configuration granularity. The first dimension is adding CPs to the configuration. The second is changing the capacity setting of the CPs currently installed to a higher model capacity identifier. In addition, a capacity increase can be delivered by increasing the CP capacity setting, and at the same time decreasing the number of active CPs. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ allows the",
