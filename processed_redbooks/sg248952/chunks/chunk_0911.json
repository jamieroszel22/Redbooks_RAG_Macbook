This option provides more resources to use EDA when repairing a drawer or memory on a drawer. They are also available when upgrading memory when larger memory cards might be required. \u0002 Concurrent Driver Maintenance (CDM) One of the greatest contributors to downtime during planned outages is LIC driver updates that are performed in support of new features and functions. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ is designed to support the concurrent activation of a selected new driver level. \u0002 Concurrent fanout addition or replacement A PCIe+ fanout card provides the path for data between memory and I/O through PCIe cables. With IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, a hot-pluggable and concurrently upgradeable fanout card is available (feature dependent). Up to 3 PCIe fanout cards for PCIe+ I/O drawers per system are supported for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. An IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16",
