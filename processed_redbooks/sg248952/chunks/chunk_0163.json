Central processor complex hardware components 51 Memory upgrades can be ordered and enabled by LIC, upgrading the DIMM cards, adding DIMM cards, or adding a CPC drawer. For an upgrade that results in the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum memory increment is added to the system. Each CPC drawer has a minimum physical memory size of 1024 GB. During an upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation. Adding physical memory to the added drawer is also concurrent. If all or part of the added memory is enabled for use, it might become available to an active LPAR if the partition includes defined reserved storage. (For more information, see 3.7.3, \u201cReserved storage\u201d on page 128.) Alternatively, the added memory can be used by a defined LPAR that is activated after the memory is added. 3146 512 4448",
