It is native to Db2 for z/OS, which reduces the need for more gateway products that can affect performance and availability. The application uses the DRDA requester or server to access a remote database. IBM Db2 Connect is an example of a DRDA application requester. 12 z/OS V2R2 and later (older z/OS versions are out of support) 110 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide \u0002 Star schema query processing, which is mostly used in business intelligence work.
