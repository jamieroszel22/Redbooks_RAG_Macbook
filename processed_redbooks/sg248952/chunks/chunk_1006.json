The HMC is used to start the power-on reset (POR) of the system. During the POR, processor units (PUs) are characterized and placed into their respective pools, memory is put into a single storage pool, and the IOCDS is loaded and started into the hardware system area (HSA). The hardware messages task displays hardware-related messages at the CPC, LPAR, or SE level. It also displays hardware messages that relate to the HMC. Note: All other previous IP addresses are no longer supported. Chapter 10. Hardware Management Console and Support Element 421 10.5.2 LPAR management Use the HMC to define LPAR properties, such as the number of processors of each type, how many are reserved, and how much memory is assigned to it. These parameters are defined in LPAR profiles and stored on the SE. Because Processor",
