For both, the PU total is the sum of CPs and zIIPs. z/VM supports up to 64 processors. \u0002 Configure reserved storage to LPARs. Configuring reserved storage for all LPARs before their activation enables them to be nondisruptive upgraded. The operating system that is running in the LPAR must configure memory online. The amount of reserved storage can be greater than the CPC drawer threshold limit, even if no other CPC drawer is installed. With IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ, the current partition storage limit is 4TB for z/OS V2.R3 & V2.R4 and 16TB for z/OS V2.R5 and later. z/VM V7.R1 supports 2 TB and z/VM V7.R2 supports 4TB memory partitions.
