Although dedicated engines are preferable to obtain the best CF performance, Coupling Thin Interrupts helps facilitate the use of a shared pool of engines, which helps to lower hardware acquisition costs. The interrupt causes a shared logical processor CF partition to be dispatched by PR/SM (if it is not already dispatched), which allows the request or signal to be processed in a more timely manner. The CF relinquishes control when work is exhausted or when PR/SM takes the physical processor away from the logical processor. On IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, the use of Coupling Thin Interrupts (DYNDISP=THIN) is now the only option that is available for shared",
