If a PCIe+ I/O drawer is added to an IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ and original features must be physically moved to another PCIe+ I/O drawer, original card moves are disruptive. 21CS VSEn, z/TPF, and Linux on IBM Z do not provide dynamic I/O configuration support. Although installing the new hardware is done concurrently, defining the new hardware to these operating systems requires an IPL. 8.4 Permanent upgrade by using the CIU facility By using the CIU facility (through the IBM Resource Link), you can start a permanent upgrade for CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, and IFLs, or memory. When performed through the CIU facility, you add the resources without IBM personnel present at",
