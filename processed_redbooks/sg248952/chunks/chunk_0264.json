The mentioned addition of PU chips in the first CPC drawer is a disruptive upgrade, the addition of the second CPC drawer is always non-disruptive for the IBM z16 A02, but for the IBM z16 AGZ only if planned ahead when the original machine was ordered. For more information about Capacity on Demand, see Chapter 8, \u201cSystem upgrades\u201d on page 319. PU sparing If a PU failure occurs, the failed PU\u2019s characterization is dynamically and transparently reassigned to a spare PU. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ have two spare PUs. PUs that are",
