  "content": "the IBM Z platform and storage. The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature allows you to make synchronous requests for data that is in the storage cache of the IBM DS8900F. This process is done by directly connecting the zHyperLink Express1.1 port in the IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ to an I/O Bay port of the IBM DS8000\u00ae. This short distance (up to 150 m [492 feet), direct connection is designed for low-latency reads and writes, such as with IBM DB2\u00ae for z/OS synchronous I/O reads and log writes.

IBM z16 AGZ supports the same features as IBM z16 A02. Chapter 1. Introduction and overview 15 Working with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve application response time, which cuts I/O-sensitive workload response time in half without requiring application changes.7 1.3.6 Network connectivity The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are a fully",
