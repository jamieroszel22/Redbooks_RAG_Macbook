For more information about performance, see the Large Systems Performance Reference for IBM Z page of the Resource Link website. For more information about millions of service units (MSU) ratings, see the IBM Z hardware and software consumptions solutions of the IBM IT infrastructure website. 12.2.1 LSPR workload suite Historically, LSPR capacity tables, including pure workloads and mixes, were identified with application names or a software characteristic; for example, CICS, IMS, OLTP-T,3 CB-L,4 LoIO-mix,5 and TI-mix.6 However, capacity performance is more closely associated with how a workload uses and interacts with a particular processor hardware design. The CPU Measurement Facility (CPU MF) data that was introduced on the z10 provides insight into the interaction of workload and hardware design in production workloads. CPU MF data helps LSPR to adjust",
