This processor access to caches and memory is called 12.4, \u201cRelative Nest Intensity\u201d on page 461. By using this data, LSPR introduces three workload capacity categories that replace all older primitives and mixes. LSPR contains the internal throughput rate ratios (ITRRs) for the z16 and the previous generation processor families. These ratios are based on measurements and projections that use standard IBM benchmarks in a controlled environment. Note: If your software configuration is different from what is described here, the performance results might vary. 3 Traditional online transaction processing workload (formerly known as IMS). 4 Commercial batch with long-running jobs. 5 Low I/O Content Mix Workload. 6 Transaction Intensive Mix Workload.
