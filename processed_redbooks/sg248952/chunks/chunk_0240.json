On-core cryptography coprocessor (CPACF) CPACF accelerates the encrypting and decrypting of SSL/TLS transactions, virtual private network (VPN)-encrypted data transfers, and data-storing applications that do not require FIPS 140-2 level 4 security. The assist function uses a special instruction set for symmetrical clear key cryptographic encryption and decryption, and for hash operations. This group of instructions is known as the Message-Security Assist (MSA). For more information about these instructions, see z/Architecture Principles of Operation, SA22-7832. Crypto functions enhancements The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ microprocessor structure was optimized and aligned to the new cache hierarchy.",
