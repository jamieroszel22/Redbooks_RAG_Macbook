  "content": "automatically deactivated when HiperDispatch is active. However, the LPAR weight management function remains active with IRD with HiperDispatch. For more information about HiperDispatch, see 3.7, \u201cLogical partitioning\u201d on page 119. HiperDispatch manages the number of logical CPs in use. It adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR to achieve the optimal balance between CP resources and the requirements of the workload. HiperDispatch also adjusts the number of logical processors. The goal is to map the logical processor to as few physical processors as possible. This configuration uses the processor resources more efficiently by trying to stay within the local cache structure. Doing so makes efficient use of the advantages of the high-frequency microprocessors, and improves throughput and response times. \u0002 Dynamic channel path management (DCM) DCM moves FICON channel bandwidth between disk control units to address current processing needs.
