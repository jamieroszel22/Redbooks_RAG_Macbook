Software-based compression algorithms can be costly in terms of processor resources, storage costs, and network bandwidth. An optional PCIe feature that was available for IBM z14, zEDC Express, addressed customer requirements by providing hardware-based acceleration for data compression and decompression. zEDC provided data compression with lower CPU consumption than compression technology that was available on the IBM Z server. Clients deployed zEDC compression to deliver the following types of compression: \u0002 Storage \u0002 Data",
