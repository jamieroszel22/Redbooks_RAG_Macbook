Both the BM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ configurations support PCIe+ I/O drawers only. I/O cage, I/O drawer, and PCIe I/O drawer are not supported. 4.1.1 I/O infrastructure IBM Z I/O is based on industry standard Peripheral Component Interconnect Express Generation 3 (PCIe Gen3) I/O infrastructure. The PCIe I/O infrastructure that is provided by the central processor complex (CPC) enhances I/O capability and flexibility, while allowing for the future integration of PCIe adapters and features. The PCIe I/O infrastructure in IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ consists of the following components: \u0002 PCIe+ Gen3 dual port fanouts that support 16 GBps I/O bus for CPC drawer connectivity to the PCIe+ I/O drawers. It connects to the PCIe Interconnect Gen3 in the PCIe+ I/O drawers. \u0002 Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR and ICA",
