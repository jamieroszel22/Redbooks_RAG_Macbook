  "content": "devices, such as disks and networks. The CHPID Mapping Tool can be used to assist with configuring a system for high availability. Enhanced (CPC) drawer availability (EDA) allows a single CPC drawer in a multidrawer CPC to be removed and reinstalled (serviced) concurrently for an upgrade or a repair. Removing a CPC drawer means that the connectivity to the I/O devices that are connected to that CPC drawer is lost. To prevent connectivity loss, the redundant I/O interconnect feature allows you to maintain connection to critical I/O devices (except for ICA SR1.1) when a CPC drawer is removed. 2.7.1 Redundant I/O interconnect Redundancy is provided for PCIe I/O interconnects. The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports up to 16 PCIe features, which are organized in two hardware domains (for each drawer). The infrastructure for the fanout to I/O drawers and external coupling is shown in Figure 2-22.
