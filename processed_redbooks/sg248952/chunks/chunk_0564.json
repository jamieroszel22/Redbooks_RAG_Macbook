Each of these sets belongs to the following domains: \u0002 A cryptographic domain index, in the range of 0 - 39 for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, is allocated to a logical partition in its image profile. The same domain must also be allocated to the ICSF instance that is running in the logical partition that uses the Options data set. Chapter 6. Cryptographic features 227 \u0002 Each ICSF instance accesses only the Master Keys or queue registers that correspond to the domain number that is specified in the logical partition image profile at the SE and in its Options data set. Each ICSF instance sees a logical cryptographic coprocessor that consists of the physical cryptographic engine and the unique set of registers (the domain) that is allocated to this logical partition. The installation of CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) DES/TDES enablement (FC 3863) is required to use the",
