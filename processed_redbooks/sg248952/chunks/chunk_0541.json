  "content": "according to the BrainPool recommendations. \u0002 Montgomery Modular Math Engine: The Montgomery Modular Math Engine is a method for fast modular multiplication. Many crypto systems, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman key Exchange, can use this method. \u0002 Random Number Generator (RNG): The generation of random numbers for cryptographic key generation is supported. \u0002 Prime Number Generator (PNG): The generation of prime numbers is also supported. \u0002 Clear Key Fast Path (Symmetric and Asymmetric): This mode of operation gives a direct hardware path to the cryptographic engine and provides high performance for public-key cryptographic functions. Several of these algorithms require a secure key and must run on an HSM. Some of these algorithms can also run with a clear key on the CPACF. Many standards are supported only when Crypto Express8S is running in CCA mode. Others are supported only when the adapter is running in EP11 mode. 4 SHA-3 was standardized by NIST in 2015. SHA-2 is still acceptable",
