OSA-Express7S 1.2 GbE SX (FC 0455) The OSA-Express7S 1.2 GbE SX feature includes one PCIe adapter and two ports. The two ports share a channel path identifier (CHPID type OSD). The ports support attachment to a 1 Gbps Ethernet LAN. Each port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 GbE SX feature supports the use of an LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device has an SX transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SX to SX). A multi-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting each port on this feature to the selected device. OSA-Express7S 1.2 1000BASE-T (FC 0458) Feature code 0458 occupies one slot in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. It features two ports",
