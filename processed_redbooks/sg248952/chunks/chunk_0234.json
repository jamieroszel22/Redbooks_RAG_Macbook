Branch direction is predicted based on history. \u2013 Perceptron: Called a Perceptron because this is a neural network algorithm that learns to correlate branch history over time and predicts direction of branches that the other mechanisms cannot catch with sufficient accuracy \u0002 Target: \u2013 Two table TAGE Changing Target Buffer (CTB): A two-level table (with different history lengths). Branches are remembered that have different targets depending on history. \u2013 Return Address Table Call/Return Stack (RAT CRS): Multi-level CRS that is implemented as a table lookup 3.4.4 Superscalar processor A scalar processor is a processor that is based on a single-issue architecture, which means that only a single instruction is run at a time. A superscalar processor allows concurrent (parallel) execution of instructions by adding resources to the microprocessor in multiple pipelines, each working on its own set of instructions to create parallelism. A superscalar processor is based on a",
