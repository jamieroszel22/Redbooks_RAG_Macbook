However, when on a processor, this component tends to be similar across all models of that processor. 12.3.3 Memory hierarchy and memory nest The memory hierarchy of a processor generally refers to the caches, data buses, and memory arrays that stage the instructions and data that must be run on the microprocessor to complete a transaction or job. The following design choices affect this component: \u0002 Cache size \u0002 Latencies (sensitive to distance from the microprocessor) \u0002 Number of levels, the Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid (MESI) protocol, controllers, switches, the number and bandwidth of data buses, and so on. Certain caches are",
