In some cases, threads can use shared resources that are not experiencing competition. Two threads (A and B) that are running on the same processor core on different pipeline stages and sharing the core resources is shown in Figure 3-8. Figure 3-8 Two threads running simultaneously on the same processor core The use of SMT provides more efficient use of the processors\u2019 resources and helps address memory latency, which results in overall throughput gains. The active thread shares core resources in space, such as data and instruction caches, TLBs, branch history tables, and, in time, pipeline slots, execution units, and address translators. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 83 Although SMT increases the processing capacity, the performance in some cases might be superior if a single thread is",
