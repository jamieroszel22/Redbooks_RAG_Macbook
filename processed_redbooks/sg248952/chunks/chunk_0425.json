The 25GbE RoCE Express3 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. Both point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class 25GbE switch are supported. 25GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0453) 25GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0453) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and is supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The 25GbE RoCE Express3 LR is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID and is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD). The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 100 meters (328 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 25GbE switch or to another 25GbE RoCE Express3 LR feature: \u0002 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends",
