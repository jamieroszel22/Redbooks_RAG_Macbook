  "content": "firmware Security and data integrity are critical issues with firmware upgrades. Procedures are in place to use a process to digitally sign the firmware update files that are sent to the HMC, SE, and TKE. By using a hash algorithm, a message digest is generated that is then encrypted with a private key to produce a digital signature. This operation ensures that any changes that are made to the data are detected during the upgrade process by verifying the digital signature. It helps ensure that no malware can be installed on IBM Z products during firmware updates. It also enables the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF) functions to comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3 Level 1 planned for Cryptographic LIC changes. The enhancement follows the IBM Z focus of security for the HMC and the SE. The Crypto Express8S (CEX8S) is compliant with CCA PCI HSM. TKE workstation is optional when used to manage a Crypto",
