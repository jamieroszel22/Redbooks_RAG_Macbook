  "content": "protect the key, keys are classified into the following levels: \u0002 A clear key is a key that is transferred from the application in clear text to the cryptographic function. The key value is stored in the clear (at least briefly) somewhere in unprotected memory areas. Therefore, the key can be made available to someone under certain circumstances who is accessing this memory area. This risk must be considered when clear keys are used. However, many applications exist where this risk can be accepted. For example, the transaction security for the (widely used) encryption methods Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is based on clear keys. \u0002 The value of a protected key is stored only in clear in memory areas that cannot be read by applications or users. The key value does not exist outside of the physical hardware, although the hardware might not be tamper-resistant. The principle of protected keys is unique to IBM Z.
