N_Port ID Virtualization N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) allows multiple system images (in LPARs or z/VM guests) to use a single FCP channel as though each were the sole user of the channel. First introduced with IBM z9\u00ae EC, this feature can be used with earlier FICON features that were carried forward from earlier servers. By using the FICON Express16S (or newer) as an FCP channel with NPIV enabled, the maximum numbers of the following aspects for one FCP physical channel are doubled: \u0002 Maximum number of NPIV hosts defined: Increased from 32 to 64 \u0002 Maximum number of remote N_Ports communicated: Increased from 512 to 1024 \u0002 Maximum number of addressable LUNs: Increased from 4096 to 8192 \u0002 Concurrent I/O operations: Increased from 764 to 1528 For more information about operating systems that support NPIV, see \u201cN_Port ID Virtualization\u201d on page 291.
