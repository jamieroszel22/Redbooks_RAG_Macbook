  "content": "technology. Although support is provided by z/OS starting with z/OS V2.R2, the capabilities and use of IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ depends on the z/OS release. Optional web deliverables15 are needed for some functions on some releases. In general, consider the following guidelines: \u0002 Do not change software releases and hardware at the same time. \u0002 At minimum apply maintenance from the following FIXCAT to all systems that will participate in a sysplex with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ regardless of whether the systems will be migrated to the current hardware: \u2013 IBM.Device.Server.IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ -3931.RequiredService \u2013 IBM.Device.Server.IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ A02-3932.RequiredService \u0002 Keep members of the sysplex at the same software level, except during brief migration periods. \u0002 Upgrade Coupling Facility LPARs to current levels (prior to the CF upgrade you should review all structure sizes using the CFSIZER tool). \u0002 Review any restrictions and migration considerations",
