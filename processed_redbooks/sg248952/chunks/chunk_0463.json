  "content": "CCA enhancements include the ability to use triple-length (192-bit) Triple-DES (TDES) keys for operations, such as data encryption, PIN processing, and key wrapping to strengthen security. CCA also extended the support for the cryptographic requirements of the German Banking Industry Committee Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft (DK). Several features that support the use of the AES algorithm in banking applications also were added to CCA. These features include the addition of AES-related key management features and the AES ISO Format 4 (ISO-4) PIN blocks as defined in the ISO 9564-1 standard. PIN block translation is supported as well as usage of AES PIN blocks in other CCA callable services. IBM continues to add enhancements as AES finance industry standards are released 4.7.3 Crypto Express7S feature (FC 0898 and FC 0899) as carry forward only The Crypto Express7S are supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. These coprocessors are Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) that provide high-security",
