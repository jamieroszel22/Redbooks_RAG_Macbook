These two cables and according IP configuration have to be planned if Note: The HMC must be connected to the SEs by using a customer provided switch. Otherwise you will never get a communication from the HMCs to the SEs. Direct connection between HMC and SEs is not supported. 3 Time-based One Time Password Chapter 10.
