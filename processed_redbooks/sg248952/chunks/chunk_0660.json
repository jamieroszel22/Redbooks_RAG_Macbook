  "content": "known as SIMD, enables more consolidation of analytic workloads and business transactions on IBM Z servers. SIMD on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ has support for enhanced math libraries that provide performance improvements for analytical workloads by processing more information with a single CPU instruction. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. Operating System support includes the following features5: \u0002 Enablement of vector registers. \u0002 A math library with an optimized and tuned math function (Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem [MASS]) that can be used in place of some of the C standard math functions. It includes a SIMD vectorized and non-vectorized version. \u0002 A specialized math library, which is known as Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS), that is optimized for the hardware. \u0002 IBM Language Environment\u00ae for C runtime function enablement for ATLAS. \u0002 DBX to support the disassembly of the new vector",
