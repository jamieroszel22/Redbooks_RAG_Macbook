This configuration allows for a logical and virtual server coexistence and maximizes system utilization and efficiency by sharing hardware resources. \u0002 Offer high-performance computing to achieve the outstanding response times that are required by new workload-type applications. This performance is achieved by high-frequency, enhanced superscalar processor technology, out-of-order core execution, large high-speed buffers (cache) and memory, an architecture with multiple complex instructions, and high-bandwidth channels. \u0002 Offer the high capacity and scalability that are required by the most demanding applications, from the",
