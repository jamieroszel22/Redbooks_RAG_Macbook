The features support now also LR optics and 25 Gbit Ethernet switches with relaxed requirements. The features are installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and are supported only on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The 25GbE RoCE Express3 are native PCIe features which not use a CHPID and are defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD). The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID). The 25GbE RoCE Express3 SR (FC 0452) feature connects",
