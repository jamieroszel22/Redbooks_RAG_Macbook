An SE sends a command to the BMC to start the power supply. The BMC cycles the various components of the power supply, monitors the success of each step and the resulting voltages, and reports the status back to the SE. SEs are duplexed (N+1), and each support element has at least one BMC and two internal Ethernet LANs for redundancy. Crossover capability between the LANs is available so both SEs can operate on both. The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and SEs/HMAs are connected directly to one or two Client Ethernet LANs. One or more HMCs can be used. 2.2.4 CPC drawer power The power for the CPC drawer has",
