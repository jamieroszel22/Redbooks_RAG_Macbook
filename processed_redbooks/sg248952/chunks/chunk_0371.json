  "content": "constitute an I/O domain. The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports concurrent add and replace I/O features with which you can increase I/O capability as needed, depending on the CPC drawer. Figure 4-3 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ I/O connectivity - Max32 feature with two PCIe+ I/O drawers The PCIe slots in a PCIe+ I/O drawer are organized into two I/O domains. Each I/O domain supports up to eight features and is driven through a PCIe switch card. Two PCIe switch cards always provide a backup path for each other through the passive connection in the PCIe+ I/O drawer backplane. During a PCIe fanout card or cable failure, 16 I/O cards in two domains can be driven through a single PCIe switch card. It is not possible to drive 16 I/O cards after one of the PCIe switch cards is removed. The two switch cards are interconnected through the PCIe+ I/O drawer board (Redundant I/O Interconnect, or RII). In addition, switch cards in same PCIe+ I/O drawer are connected to PCIe fanouts across clusters in CPC",
