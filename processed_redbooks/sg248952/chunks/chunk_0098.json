  "content": "network overhead. HiperSockets is a function of the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). It provides LAN connectivity across multiple system images on the same IBM Z platform by performing memory-to-memory data transfers in a secure way. The HiperSockets function eliminates the use of I/O subsystem operations. It also eliminates having to traverse an external network connection to communicate between LPARs in the same IBM Z platform. In this way, HiperSockets can help with server consolidation by connecting virtual servers and simplifying the enterprise network. RoCE Express The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3 features8 use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory communications between two IBM Z platforms. These features are designed to help reduce consumption of CPU resources for applications that use the TCP/IP stack (such as IBM WebSphere\u00ae that accesses an IBM Db2\u00ae database). They can also help reduce network latency with",
