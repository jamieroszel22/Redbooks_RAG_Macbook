Out-of-order execution Out-of-order (OOO) execution yields significant performance benefits for compute-intensive applications by reordering instruction execution, which allows later (newer) instructions to be run ahead of a stalled instruction, and reordering storage accesses and parallel storage accesses. OOO maintains good performance growth for traditional applications. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. For more information, see \u201c3.4.3, \u201cOut-of-Order execution\u201d on page 84. z/OS DFSORT exploitation of IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort The Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort, is an \u201con chip\u201d hardware feature available on IBM z15 and newer servers and which is driven by the SORT LISTS (SORTL) instruction. z/OS DFSORT takes advantage of Z Sort, providing users with significant performance boosts for their sort workloads. With z/OS DFSORT's Z Sort algorithm, clients can see batch sort job",
