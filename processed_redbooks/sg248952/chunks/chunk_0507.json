  "content": "important who sees or knows the public key. Whatever is done with one key can be undone by the other key only. For example, data that is encrypted by the public key can be decrypted by the associated private key only, and vice versa. Unlike symmetric algorithms, which use distinct functions for encryption and decryption, only one function is used in asymmetric algorithms. Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data. Asymmetric algorithms are also known as public key algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms use complex calculations and are relatively slow (about 100 - 1000 times slower than symmetric algorithms). Therefore, such algorithms are not used for the encryption of bulk data. Because the private key is never exchanged between the parties in communication, they are less vulnerable than symmetric algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms mainly are used for authentication, digital signatures, and for the encryption and exchange of secret keys,",
