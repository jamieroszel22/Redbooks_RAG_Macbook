VFM also can be used in CF images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures. Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 135 3.10.2 VFM feature A VFM feature (FC 0644) is 512 GB of memory on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The maximum number of VFM features is 4 per IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ system. Ordered VFM memory reduces the maximum orderable memory. Simplification in its management is of great value because no hardware adapter is needed to manage. It also has no hardware repair and verify. It has a better performance because no I/O to attached adapter occurs. Finally, because this feature is part of memory, it is protected by RAIM",
