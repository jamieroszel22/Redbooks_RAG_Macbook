Set the DYNCPADD parameter in member LOADxx to ENABLE. 8.2.1 CPC drawer feature and PU capacity upgrades IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ have a machine type 3932 and a model capacity identifier. The 3932 is available with the following four CPC drawer features: \u0002 Feature Max5 (single CPC drawer installed) can have a maximum of five PUs for client characterization. \u0002 Feature Max16 (single CPC drawer) can have a maximum of 16 client PUs. \u0002 Feature Max32 (single CPC drawer) can have a maximum of 32 client PUs. \u0002 Feature Max68 (two CPC drawers) can have a maximum of 68 client PUs. Model capacity identifiers (MCI) are A01 to Z06. The MCI described how many CPs are characterized (01 - 06) and the capacity setting (A to Z) of the CPs). A hardware configuration upgrade always requires more physical hardware (CPC drawers, PCIe+ I/O drawers, or both). A",
