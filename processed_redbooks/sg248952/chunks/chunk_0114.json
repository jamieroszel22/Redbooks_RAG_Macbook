The L2, L3, and L4 cache powerful symbol ECC is designed to make it resistant to more failure mechanisms. Preemptive DRAM marking is added to the main memory to isolate and recover failures more quickly. 16 z/OS configured as a guest system under z/VM does not use the boost. \u00a9 Copyright IBM Corp. 2023. 21 Chapter 2.
