Simultaneous multithreading SMT is the hardware capability to process up to two simultaneous threads in a single core, sharing the resources of the core such as cache, translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and execution resources. This improves system capacity and efficiency by reducing processor delays, which increases the overall throughput of the system. SMT4 is supported for zIIPs and IFLs.
