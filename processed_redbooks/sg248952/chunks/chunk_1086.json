For more information about getting CPUMF counter data, see the CPU MF - 2022 Update and WSC Experiences of the IBM Techdoc Library website. 12.8 Workload performance variation As the size of transistors approaches the size of atoms that stand as a fundamental physical barrier, a processor chip\u2019s performance can no longer double every two years (Moore\u2019s Law8 does not apply). A holistic performance approach is required when the performance gains are reduced because of frequency. Therefore, hardware and software synergy becomes an absolute requirement. Starting with z13, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) improvements in core and cache became the driving factor for performance gains. As these microarchitectural features increase (which contributes to instruction parallelism), overall workload performance variability also increases because not",
