The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge The HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge is supported on IBM Z servers. With the HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge, z/VM virtual switch is enhanced to transparently bridge a guest virtual machine network connection on a HiperSockets LAN segment. This bridge allows a single HiperSockets guest virtual machine network connection to also directly communicate with the following components: \u0002 Other guest virtual machines on the virtual switch \u0002 External network hosts through the virtual switch OSA UPLINK port The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257.
