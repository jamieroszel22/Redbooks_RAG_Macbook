The 64-bit operating systems are in 31-bit mode at IPL and change to 64-bit mode during their initialization. The operating system is responsible for taking advantage of the addressing capabilities that are provided by the architectural mode. For more information about operating system support, see Chapter 7, \u201cOperating system support\u201d on page 243.
