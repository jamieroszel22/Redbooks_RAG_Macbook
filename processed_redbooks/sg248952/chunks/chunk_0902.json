AIU behaves like a co-processor to process the synchronous instructions but AIU is located in nest. The core control the AIU by issuing instruction (NNPA). \u2013 The array macro have row and column repair (MD and ABIST) \u2013 1MB cache with SECDEC2 ECC \u0002 On-chip L2 caches are implemented in dense SRAM.
