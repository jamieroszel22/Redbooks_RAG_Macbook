Fan out card to I/O connectivity requirements The optimum approach is to maintain maximum I/O connectivity during drawer removal. The redundant I/O interconnect (RII) function provides for redundant connectivity to all installed I/O domains in the PCIe+ I/O drawers. Preparing for enhanced drawer availability The Prepare Concurrent Drawer replacement option validates that enough dormant resources are available for this operation. If enough resources are not available on the remaining drawers to complete the EDA process, the process identifies those resources. It then guides you through a series of steps to select and free up those resources. The preparation process does not complete until all processors, memory, and I/O conditions are successfully resolved. The",
