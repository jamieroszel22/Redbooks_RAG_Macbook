The only option is to always include zVFM plan ahead when Flexible Memory option is selected. 136 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide IBM SSC is a part of the Pervasive Encryption concept that was introduced with IBM z14, which is aimed at delivering best IBM Security hardware and software enhancements, services, and practices for 360-degree infrastructure protection. LPAR is defined as IBM SSC by using the HMC. The IBM SSC solution includes the following key advantages: \u0002 Applications require zero changes to use IBM SSC; software developers do not need to write any IBM SSC-specific programming code. \u0002 End-to-end encryption (in-flight and at-rest data): \u2013 Automatic Network Encryption (TLS, IPsec): Data-in-flight. Automatic File System Encryption (LUKS): Data-at-rest. \u2013 Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) is the",
