A balanced plugging of native PCIe features exists between four resource groups (RG1, RG2, RG3, and RG4). The preassigned PCHID number of each I/O port relates directly to its physical location (jack location in a specific slot). 154 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide 4.6 Connectivity I/O channels are part of the CSS. They provide connectivity for data exchange between systems, between systems and external control units (CUs) and devices, or between networks.
