Before setting the TLS level to 1.3, you have to ensure that all services and servers connecting via TLS to the HMC and SE do support TLS 1.3 as well (for example, the remote browser, LDAP Authentication Servers, WebServices API connections, Fibre Channel End Point Security, FTPS, Single Object Operations). TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not supported with Driver 51/Version 2.16.0. If minimum TLS version is set to 1.2, TLS 1.3 will be attempted first, then fall back to TLS 1.2 if required. 1 IBM ID is required for authentication and access to Resource Link. 396 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Figure 10-1 on page 396 shows the HMC panel that allows the selection of the desired TLS version.
