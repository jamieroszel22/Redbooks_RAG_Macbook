The iPDUs are controlled by using an Ethernet port and support the following inputs: \u0002 3-phase 200 - 240 V AC (wired as \u201cDelta\u201d) 12 Power System Control Network - PSCN 66 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide \u0002 3-phase 380 - 415 V AC (wired as \u201cWye\u201d) \u0002 Single phase 200 - 240 V AC. The power supply units convert the AC power to DC power that is used as input for the Points of Load (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers. The power requirements depend on the number of CPC drawers (1 or 2), number of PCIe I/O drawers (0 - 3) and I/O features that are installed in the PCIe I/O drawers. iPDUs are installed and serviced from the rear of the frame. Unused power ports are never used by any external device. Each iPDU installed requires a customer supplied power feed. The number of",
