With IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, this process occurs whenever the configuration changes, such as in the following circumstances: \u0002 Activating or deactivating an LPAR \u0002 Changing the LPARs processing weights \u0002 Upgrading the system through a temporary or permanent record \u0002 Downgrading the system through deactivation of a temporary record PR/SM schedules a global reoptimization of the resources in use. It does so by reviewing all the partitions that are active and prioritizing them based on their processing entitlement and weights, which creates a high- and low-priority rank. Then, the resources, such as logical processors and memory, can be moved from one CPC drawer to another to address the priority ranks that were created. When partitions are activated, PR/SM tries to find a home assignment CPC drawer, home assignment node, and home",
