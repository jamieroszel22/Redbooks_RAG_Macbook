Figure 9-1 RAS design process overview 9.2 Technology This section introduces some of the RAS features that are incorporated in the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ design. 9.2.1 Processor Unit chip IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ use the Processor Unit (PU) chip with the following technical changes: Chapter 9. Reliability, availability, and serviceability 367 \u0002 A processor unit (PU) chip is manufactured using 7nm CMOS FinFET technology featuring EUV lithography, and has eight cores (PUs) per chip (design) running at 4.6 GHz. \u0002 Each core has private L1 (instruction and data) caches and a semi-private L2 cache, 32 MB in size. The eight cores and L2 caches on the chip communicate through bi-directional high speed on-chip ring and with all",
