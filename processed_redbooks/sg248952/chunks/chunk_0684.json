In addition to CFCC Level 22 enhancements, it introduces the following enhancements: \u0002 Asynchronous cross invalidation (XI) for CF cache structures This enhancement requires z/OS fixes for APARs OA54688 (exploitation) and OA54985 (toleration). It also requires explicit data manager support (Db2 V12 with PTFs). \u0002 Coupling Facility hang detection These enhancements provide a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability. With this support, the CFCC dispatcher significantly reduces the CF hang detection interval to only 2 seconds, which allows more timely detection and recovery from such events. When a hang is detected, in most cases the CF confines the scope of the failure to \u201cstructure damage\u201d for the single CF",
