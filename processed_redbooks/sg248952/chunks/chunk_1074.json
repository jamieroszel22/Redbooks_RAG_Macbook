Therefore, no assurance can be given that an individual user can achieve throughput improvements that are equivalent to the performance ratios that are stated. 12.3 Fundamental components of workload performance Workload performance is sensitive to the following major factors: \u0002 Instruction path length \u0002 Instruction complexity \u0002 Memory hierarchy and memory nest These factors are described next. 12.3.1 Instruction path length A transaction or job runs a set of instructions to complete its task. These instructions are composed of various paths through the operating system, subsystems, and application. The total count of instructions that are run across these software components is referred to as the transaction or job path length. The path length varies for each transaction or job, and depends on the complexity of the tasks that must be run. For a particular transaction or job, the application",
