  "content": "partition, TKE host, and TKE target If one or more LPARs are configured to use Crypto Express coprocessors, the TKE workstation can be used to manage DES, AES, ECC, and PKA master keys. This management can be done for all cryptographic domains of each Crypto Express coprocessor feature that is assigned to the LPARs that are defined to the TKE workstation. Each LPAR in the same system that uses a domain that is managed through a TKE workstation connection is a TKE host or TKE target. An LPAR with a TCP/IP connection to the TKE is referred to as the TKE host; all other partitions are TKE targets. The cryptographic controls that are set for an LPAR through the SE determine whether the workstation is a TKE host or a TKE target. 6.6.2 Optional smart card reader An optional smart card reader (FC 0891) can be added to the TKE workstation. One FC 0891 includes two smart card readers, two cables to connect them to the TKE workstation, and 20 smart cards. The reader supports the use of smart",
