The max. number of HSMs per IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ, combining all cryptographic features is 40, while the max. number of single HSM (port) cryptographic features is 16 (CEX8S (single HSM), CEX7S (1 port), and CEX6S) c. More than one partition, which is defined to the same channel subsystem (CSS) or to different CSSs, can use the same domain number when assigned to different PCIe cryptographic adapters. 218 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide WRAPENH3 is supported, which is very important for independently reviewed key block protection for keys used in PCI PIN audited workloads. \u0002 AES, AESKW, AES GMAC, AES GCM, AES XTS, AES CIPHER mode, and CMAC: AES replaced DES as the official US standard in October 2000.
