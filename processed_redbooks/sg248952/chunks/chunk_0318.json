The defined storage must be available during the LPAR activation; otherwise, the LPAR activation fails. Reserved storage can be defined to an LPAR, which enables nondisruptive memory addition to and removal from an LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (z/OS and z/VM). For more information, see 3.7.4, \u201cLogical partition storage granularity\u201d on page 129. \u0002 Channels Channels can be shared between LPARs by including the partition name in the partition list of a channel-path identifier (CHPID). I/O configurations are defined by the IOCP or the HCD with the CHPID mapping tool",
