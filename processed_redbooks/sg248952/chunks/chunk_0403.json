This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances. Read Diagnostic Parameter Extended Link Service support To improve the accuracy of identifying a failed component without unnecessarily replacing components in a SAN fabric, a new Extended Link Service (ELS) command called Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) was added to the Fibre Channel T11 standard to allow IBM Z to obtain extra diagnostic data from the SFP optics that are throughout the SAN fabric. IBM z14 and newer IBM Z can read this extra diagnostic data for all the ports that are accessed in the I/O configuration and make the data available to an LPAR. For z/OS LPARs that use FICON channels, z/OS displays the data with a new message and display command. For Linux on IBM Z, z/VM, z/VSE9, 21CS VSEn, and LPARs that use FCP channels, this diagnostic data is available in a new window in the SAN",
