Both share the same feature names (maximum number of characterizable processor units (PUs)): Max5, Max16, Max32, and Max68. The number of characterizable PUs, spare PUs, and System Assist Processors (SAPs) are included with each feature of IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ (see Table 1-1). Table 1-1 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ processor unit (PU) configurations The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ memory subsystem use proven redundant array of independent memory (RAIM) technology to ensure high availability. Up to 16TB (8 TB per CPC drawer) of addressable memory per system can be ordered. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ also have unprecedented capacity to meet consolidation needs with innovative I/O features for transactional and hybrid cloud environments. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ (at maximum configuration) can support up to 3 PCIe+ I/O drawers.",
