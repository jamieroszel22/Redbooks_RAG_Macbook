The main philosophy behind RAS is about preventing or tolerating (masking) outages. It is also about providing the necessary instrumentation (in hardware, LIC and microcode, and software) to capture or collect the relevant failure information to help identify an issue without requiring a re-creation of the event. These outages can be planned or unplanned. Planned Note: Memory downgrades within an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are not supported. Feature downgrades (removal of a CPC quantity feature) are also not supported. Note: Removing a CPC drawer during EDA often results in reducing total active memory. Chapter 2. Central processor complex hardware components 53 and unplanned outages can include the following situations (examples are not related to the RAS features of IBM Z): \u2013 A planned outage",
