If the primary OSC fails, the backup detects the failure, takes over transparently, and continues to provide the clock signal to the CPC. \u0002 Processor unit (PU) sparing IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ and IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ have two spare PUs per system to maintain performance levels if an active PU, Internal Coupling Facility (ICF), Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL), IBM Z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP), integrated firmware processor (IFP), or system assist processor (SAP) fails. Transparent sparing for failed processors is supported and sparing is supported across the drawers. \u0002 Application preservation 374 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide This function is used when a PU fails and no spares are available. The state of the failing PU is passed to another active PU, where the operating system uses it to successfully",
