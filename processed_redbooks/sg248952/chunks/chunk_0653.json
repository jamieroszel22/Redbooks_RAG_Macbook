Subcapacity boost might be available during the boost period to guest operating systems except for z/OS. e. Allows CP work to be dispatched on zIIPs. zIIP processor capacity boost is only available if customer has at least one active processor characterized as zIIP. For IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, IBM z16 A01 and IBM z15 T01 only, more zIIPs can be used if obtained through eBOD (temporary zIIP boost records). f. Process recovery boosts support subcapacity CPs speed boost and entitled (purchased) customer zIIPs only - zIIPs provided by FC 9930 and FC 6802 cannot be used for process recovery boosts.
