OSA-Express7S 1.2 25GbE SR (FC 0459) OSA-Express7S 1.2 25Gigabit Ethernet SR (FC 0459) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O Drawer. OSA-Express7S 1.2 25Gigabit Ethernet Short Reach (SR) feature includes one PCIe Gen3 adapter and one port per feature. The port supports CHPID types OSD. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 25GbE SR feature is designed to support attachment to a multimode fiber 25 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 25 Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 25GbE SR feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device has an SR transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SR to SR). The OSA-Express7S 1.2 25GbE SR",
