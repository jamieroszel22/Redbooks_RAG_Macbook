  "content": "Internal Code (LIC). The LIC is loaded when the system is initialized at power-on reset (POR) and the PUs are characterized. Only characterized PUs include a designated function. Non-characterized PUs are considered spares. You must order at least one CP, IFL, or ICF on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. This design brings outstanding flexibility to IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ because any PU can assume any available characterization. The design also plays an essential role in system availability because PU characterization can be done dynamically, with no system outage. Removal of support of the transactional execution and constrained transactional execution facility a: In a future IBM Z hardware system family, the transactional execution and constrained transactional execution facility will no longer be supported. Users of the facility on current zSystems servers should always check the facility indications before using it. a. Statements by IBM regarding its plans, directions, and intent",
