  "content": "OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE LR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only. A 9 \u00b5m single-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting this feature to the selected device. OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE SR (FC 0457) The OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE Short Reach (SR) feature includes one PCIe Gen3 adapter and one port per feature. The port supports CHPID types OSD. The 10 GbE feature is designed to support attachment to a multimode fiber 10 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 10 Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE SR feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device has an SR transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SR to SR). The OSA-Express7S 1.2 10GbE SR",
