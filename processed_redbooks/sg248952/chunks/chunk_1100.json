The integrated AI accelerator delivers more than 6 TFLOPs per chip and over 200 TFLOPs in the 32 chip system (a fully configured IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ with four CPC drawers). The AI accelerator is shared by all cores on the chip. The firmware, running on the cores and accelerator, orchestrates and synchronizes the execution on the accelerator. How to leverage IBM Z Integrated AI Accelerator in your enterprise This chart shows the high-level of seamless integration of AI accelerator into enterprise AI/ML solution stack. There's a great flexibility and interoperability for training and building models. Acknowledging the very diverse AI training frameworks, clients can train their models on platforms of their choice, (including IBM Z on-prem and in hybrid cloud) and then deploy",
