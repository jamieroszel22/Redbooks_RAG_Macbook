  "content": "is a new Capacity on Demand (CoD) offering available on IBM z16 A01 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ machines that allows processing capacity flexibility between an organization\u2019s primary site and alternate data centers. Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is designed to provide increased flexibility and control to organizations that want to shift production capacity between participating IBM IBM z16 A01, IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ at different sites. The capacity of any engine type can be shifted up to 12 times a year and stay at the target machine for up to 12 months after the flexible capacity record activation on the target machine. Capacity shifts can be done under full client control without IBM intervention and can be fully automated using IBM GDPS automation tools. Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency supports a broad set of scenarios and can be combined with other IBM On-Demand offerings. For additional informations see the Redpaper IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber",
