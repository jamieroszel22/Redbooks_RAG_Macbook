  "content": "resources for each input queue. This approach allows multiple concurrent z/OS processing threads to process each unique input queue (workload), which avoids traditional resource contention. IWQ reduces the conventional z/OS processing that is required to identify and separate unique workloads. This advantage results in improved overall system performance and scalability. A primary objective of IWQ is to provide improved performance for business-critical interactive workloads by reducing contention that is created by other types of workloads. In a heavily mixed workload environment, this \u201coff the wire\u201d network traffic separation is provided by OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S and OSA-Express6S12 features that are defined as CHPID type OSD. OSA IWQ is shown in Figure 7-5. Figure 7-5 OSA inbound workload queuing The following types of z/OS workloads are identified and assigned to unique input queues: \u0002 z/OS Sysplex Distributor traffic Network traffic that is associated with a distributed",
