Each feature FC 0909 has one IBM 4770 PCIe cryptographic adapter (hardware security module - HSM), whereas FC 0908 has two IBM 4770 PCIe cryptographic adapters (two HSMs). The Crypto Express8S (CEX8S) feature occupies one I/O slot in PCIe+ I/O drawer. This feature provides one or two HSMs and for a secure programming and hardware environment on which crypto processes are run. Each cryptographic coprocessor includes a general-purpose processor, non-volatile storage, and specialized cryptographic electronics. The Crypto Express8S feature provides tamper-sensing and tamper-responding, high-performance cryptographic operations. Each Crypto Express8S PCI Express adapter is available in one of the following configurations: \u0002 Secure IBM CCA coprocessor (CEX8C) - This configuration includes secure key functions. It is optionally programmable to deploy more functions and algorithms by using UDX. For more information, see 6.5.2, \u201cCrypto Express8S as a",
