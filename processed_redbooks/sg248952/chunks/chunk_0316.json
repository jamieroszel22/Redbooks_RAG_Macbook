  "content": "can be dynamically managed by the LPAR CPU Management function of the Intelligent Resource Director (IRD). These functions can be used to achieve the defined goals of this specific partition and of the overall system. The provisioning architecture of IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ systems adds a dimension to the dynamic management of LPARs, as described in Chapter 8, \u201cSystem upgrades\u201d on page 319. PR/SM supports an option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP) or an IFL that is shared across a set of LPARs. This capability is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) limit. It is not affected by changes to the logical or physical configuration of the system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs. The Change LPAR Controls and Customize Activation Profiles tasks on the HMC were enhanced to support this",
