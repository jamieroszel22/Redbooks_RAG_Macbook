A summary condition code is used only for a few instructions. 3.4.3 Out-of-Order execution IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ have an Out-of-Order core, much like the IBM z15 and IBM z14. This optimized Out-of-Order feature yields significant performance benefits for Chapter 3. Central processor complex design 85 compute-intensive applications. It does so by reordering instruction execution, which allows later (younger) instructions to be run ahead of a stalled instruction, and reordering storage accesses and parallel storage accesses. Out-of-Order maintains good performance growth for traditional applications. Out-of-Order execution can improve performance in the following ways: \u0002 Reordering instruction execution Instructions stall in a pipeline because they are waiting for results from a previous instruction or the execution",
