With this support, most CF list and lock structure ECR processing no longer uses structure-wide latching. It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use. However, a few \u201cedge conditions\u201d in ECR processing still require structure-wide latching. For more information about CFCC code levels, see the Parallel Sysplex page of the IBM IT infrastructure website. For more information about the latest CFCC code levels, see the current exception letter that is published on Resource Link website (login is required). CF structure sizing changes are expected when upgrading from a previous CFCC Level to CFCC Level 25. In fact, CFLEVEL 25 may",
