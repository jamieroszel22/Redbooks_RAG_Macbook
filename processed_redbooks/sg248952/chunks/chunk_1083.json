CPU MF data can be collected by z/OS System Measurement Facility on SMF 113 records or z/VM Monitor starting with z/VM V5R4. 12.6 Relating production workloads to LSPR workloads Historically, the following techniques were used to match production workloads to LSPR workloads: \u0002 Application name (a client that is running CICS can use the CICS LSPR workload) \u0002 Application type (create a mix of the LSPR online and batch workloads) \u0002 I/O rate (the low I/O rates that are used a mix of low I/O rate LSPR workloads) The IBM Processor Capacity Reference for IBM Z (zPCR) tool supports the following workload categories: \u0002 Low \u0002 Low-Average \u0002 Average \u0002 Average-high \u0002 High For more information about the no-charge IBM zPCR tool (which reflects the latest IBM LSPR measurements), see the Getting Started with zPCR (IBM's Processor Capacity Reference)",
