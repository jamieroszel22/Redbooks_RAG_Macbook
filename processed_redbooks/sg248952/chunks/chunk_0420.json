A 9 \u00b5m single-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting this feature to the selected device. For supported distances, see Table 4-8 on page 168. OSA-Express6S Gigabit Ethernet SX (FC 0423) The OSA-Express6S GbE SX feature includes one PCIe adapter and two ports. The two ports share a channel path identifier (CHPID type OSD). The ports support attachment to a 1 Gbps Ethernet LAN. Each port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs and across logical channel subsystems. The OSA-Express6S GbE SX feature supports the use of an LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device has an SX transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SX to SX). A multi-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting each port on this feature to the selected device. For supported",
