The Secure FTP infrastructure allows HMC and SE applications to query whether a public key is associated with a host address and to use the Secure FTP interface with the appropriate public key for a host. Tasks that use FTP now provide a selection for the secure host connection. When selected, the task verifies that a public key is associated with the specified host name. If a public key is not provided, a message window opens that points to the Manage SSH Keys task to enter a public key. The following tasks provide this support: \u0002 Import/Export IOCDS \u0002 Advanced Facilities FTP IBM Content Collector Load \u0002 Audit and Log Management (Scheduled Operations only) \u0002 FCP Configuration Import/Export \u0002 OSA view Port Parameter Export \u0002 OSA-Integrated Console Configuration Import/Export Chapter 10.
