HiperDispatch uses the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ cache topology, which features reduced cross-cluster \u201chelp\u201d and better locality for multi-task address spaces. PR/SM can use dynamic PU reassignment to move processors (CPs, ZIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, SAPs, and spares) to a different chip and drawer to improve the reuse of shared caches by processors of the same partition. It can use dynamic memory relocation (DMR) to move a running partition\u2019s memory to different physical memory to improve the affinity and reduce the distance between the memory and processors of a partition. For more information about HiperDispatch, see 3.7, \u201cLogical partitioning\u201d on page 119. 3.3.2 CPC drawer interconnect topology In a configuration with two CPC drawers (Max68), the drawers are interconnected in a point-to-point topology that allows CPC drawers to communicate with each other to make the system appears as a single large SMP structure.
