It is used in z/OS, z/VM\u00ae, 21CS VSEn, z/TPF (Transaction Processing Facility), and Linux on IBM Z environments. \u0002 Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) This standard protocol is used for communicating with disk and tape devices through FC switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM, 21CS VSEn, and Linux on IBM Z environments. FICON Express32S features are implemented by using PCIe cards, and offer better port granularity and improved capabilities over the previous FICON Express features. FICON Express32S features support a link data rate of 32 gigabits per second (Gbps) (8, 16, or 32 Gbps auto-negotiate), and it is the preferred technology for new systems. zHyperLink Express zHyperLink was created to provide fast access to data by way of low-latency connections between",
