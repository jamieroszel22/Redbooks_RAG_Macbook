Central processor complex design 87 high branch prediction success rate in combination with a pattern history table (PHT) and the use of tagged multi-target prediction technology branch prediction. Branch prediction is now implemented as a two level BTB, BTB1 (\u201csmall\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d), and BTB2 (large, dense-SRAM). Now, BTB1 and BTB2 feature dynamic (variable) capacity: \u0002 BTB1: First Level Branch Target Buffer, smaller than IBM z15, dynamic director, variable capacity: \u2013 Minimum total branches in all parents (all large branches) = 8 K \u2013 Maximum total branches in all parents (all medium branches) = 12 K \u0002 BTB2: Second Level Branch Target Buffer, also variable capacity (variable directory), up to 260 k branches Branch prediction also implements auxiliary predictors for: \u0002 Direction: \u2013 Two table TAGE7 Pattern History Table (PHT): A two-level table (with different history",
