The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ also added functions to protect today\u2019s data now, and from future cyber attacks that can be initiated by quantum computers. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ generation provides the following quantum-safe capabilities: \u0002 Key generation \u0002 Encryption \u0002 Key encapsulation mechanisms \u0002 Hybrid key exchange schemes \u0002 Dual digital signature schemes In addition to the quantum-safe cryptographic capabilities, tools such as IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI), Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF), and IBM Crypto Analytics Monitor (CAT) can help you discover where and what cryptography is used in applications. This can aid in developing a cryptographic inventory for migration and modernization planning. 1.2.1 Supported upgrade paths Upgrades from previous server generations are available as \u201cFrame Roll MES\u201d. Frame roll MES upgrades are disruptive. See Table 1-2. Table 1-2 Supported Frame Roll MES upgrades",
