  "content": "This comparison is based on the Large System Performance Reference (LSPR) mixed workload analysis. The range of performance ratings across the individual LSPR workloads is likely to have a large spread. More performance variation of individual logical partitions (LPARs) is available when an increased number of partitions and more PUs are available. For more information, see Chapter 12, \u201cPerformance\u201d on page 455. For more information about performance, see the LSPR website. For more information about millions of service units (MSUs) ratings, see the IBM Z Software Contracts website. 1.2.3 Supported operating systems The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are supported by a large set of software products and programs, including independent software vendor (ISV) applications.
