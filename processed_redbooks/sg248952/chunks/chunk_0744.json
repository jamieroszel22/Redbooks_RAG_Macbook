  "content": "The VSWITCH is a virtual network device that provides switching between OSA connections and the connected guest systems. QDIO data connection isolation allows disabling internal routing for each QDIO connected. It also provides a means for creating security zones and preventing network traffic between the zones. QDIO data connection isolation is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. QDIO interface isolation for z/OS Some environments require strict controls for routing data traffic between servers or nodes. In certain cases, the LPAR-to-LPAR capability of a shared OSA connection can prevent such controls from being enforced. With interface isolation, internal routing can be controlled on an LPAR basis. When interface isolation is enabled, the OSA discards any packets that are destined for a z/OS LPAR that is registered in the OSA Address Table (OAT) as",
