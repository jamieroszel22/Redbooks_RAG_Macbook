On an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, L2 cache (32 MB) is semi-private with 16 MB dedicated to the associated core, and 16 MB shared with the system (the 50/50 split is adjustable) implemented in SRAM3. Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) caches are now virtual caches and are allocated on L2. Two processor chips (up to eight active cores per PU chip) are combined in a Dual Chip Module (DCM) and up to four DCMs are assembled in a CPC drawer. An IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can have either one CPC drawer (Max5, Max16, and Max32) or two CPC drawers (Max68). Figure 3-1 on page 76 shows the new IBM Telum processor. 3 SRAM - Static Random Access Memory. Unlike eDRAM, SRAM does not require refresh. 76 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Figure 3-1 IBM Telum processor The new IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Dual Chip Module (DCM) is shown in Figure 3-2.
