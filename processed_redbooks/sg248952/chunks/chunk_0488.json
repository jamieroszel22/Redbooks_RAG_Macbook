Logical I/O - Channel Subsystem 195 Figure 5-4 CSS, LPAR, and identifier example LPAR name The LPAR name is defined as partition name parameter in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. The LPAR name must be unique across the server. MIF image ID The MIF image ID is defined as a parameter for each LPAR in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. It ranges 1 - F, and must be unique within an LCSS. However, duplicates are allowed in different LCSSs. If a MIF image ID is not defined, an arbitrary ID is assigned when the I/O configuration activated. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ support a maximum of three LCSSs, with a total of 40 LPARs that can be defined. Each LCSS of an IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ can support the following numbers of LPARs: \u0002 LCSS0 and LCSS1 support 15 LPARs each, and the MIF image ID is 1 - F. \u0002 LCSS2",
