By adding redundancy error-correction code (ECC) to the transmitted information, the receiver can detect and correct several errors without requiring retransmission. This process features improve signal reliability and bandwidth use by reducing retransmissions because of bit errors, especially for connections across long distance, such as an inter-switch link (ISL) in a GDPS Metro Mirror environment. The FICON Express32S and FICON Express16S+ are designed to support FEC coding on top of its 64b/66b data encoding for 16 and 32 Gbps connections. This design can correct up to 11 bit errors per 2112 bits transmitted. Therefore, while connected to devices that",
