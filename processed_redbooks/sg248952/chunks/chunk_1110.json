  "content": "zEnterprise Data Compression 481 Software decompression is slow and can involve considerable processor resources. Therefore, it is not recommended for production environments. A specific fix category that is named IBM.Function.zEDC identifies the fixes that enable or use the zEDC and On-Chip Compression function. z/OS guests that run under z/VM V7.R1 with PTFs and later can use the zEDC Express feature and IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ On-Chip Compression. For more information, look for the Enhancements to z/VM 7.1 presentation on the z/VM Presentations page on the IBM website. IBM 31-bit and 64-bit SDK for z/OS Java Technology Edition, Version 7 Release 1 (5655-W43 and 5655-W44) (IBM SDK 7 for z/OS Java) provides use of the zEDC Express feature and Shared Memory Communications-Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R), which is used by the 10GbE RoCE Express feature. For more information about how to implement and use the IBM Z compression features, see Reduce Storage Occupancy and Increase",
