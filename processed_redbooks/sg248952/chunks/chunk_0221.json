Because of these enhancements, the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ processor full speed z/OS single-thread performance is on average 1.14 times faster than the IBM z15 T02 at equal N-way. For more information about performance, see Chapter 12, \u201cPerformance\u201d on page 455. IBM z13 introduced architectural extensions with instructions that reduce processor quiesce effects, cache misses, and pipeline disruption, and",
