From the list, select the coprocessor numbers (in the range 0 - 15) that identify the PCIe adapters to be accessed by this partition. Chapter 6. Cryptographic features 229 \u0002 Cryptographic Online list Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor numbers that are automatically brought online during logical partition activation. The numbers that are selected in the online list must also be part of the candidate list. After they are activated, the active partition cryptographic definitions can be viewed from the HMC. Select the CPC, and click View LPAR Cryptographic Controls in the CPC Operational Customization window. The resulting window displays the definition of Usage and Control domain indexes, and PCI Cryptographic candidate and online lists, as shown in Figure 6-7.
