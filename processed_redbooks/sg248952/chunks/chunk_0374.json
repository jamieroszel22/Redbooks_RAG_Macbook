The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ CPC drawer I/O infrastructure consist of the following features: \u0002 The PCIe+ Generation 3 fanout cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to PCIe+ I/O drawers. \u0002 ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) fanout cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to other (external) CPCs. The PCIe fanout cards are installed in the rear of the CPC drawers. Each CPC drawer features 12 PCIe+ Gen3 fanout slots. The PCIe fanouts and ICA SR fanouts are installed in locations LG01 - LG12 at the rear in the CPC drawers (see Figure 2-7 on page 31). On the CPC drawer there are two BMC/OSC cards, each being a combination of BMC card and OSC card. BMC stands for Base Management and OSC for Oscillator Card. Each BMC/OSC card has one PPS port and one ETS port (RJ45 Ethernet, for both PTP and NTP). An I/O connection diagram is shown in Figure 4-3 on page 146. 4.4.1 PCIe+",
