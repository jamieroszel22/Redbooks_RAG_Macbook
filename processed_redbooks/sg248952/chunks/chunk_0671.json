Through enhanced hardware features (based on DAT table entry bit) and explicit software requests to obtain memory areas as non-executable, areas of memory can be protected from unauthorized execution. A Protection Exception occurs if an attempt is made to fetch an Chapter 7. Operating system support 275 instruction from an address in such an element or if an address in such an element is the target of an execute-type instruction. \u0002 z/OS To use IEP, Real Storage Manager (RSM) is enhanced to request non-executable memory allocation. Use new keyword EXECUTABLE=YES|NO on STORAGE OBTAIN or IARV64 to indicate whether memory to be used contains executable code. Recovery Termination Manager (RTM) writes LOGREC record of any program-check that results from IEP. IEP support is for z/OS V2.R2 and later running on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ with APARs OA51030 and OA51643",
