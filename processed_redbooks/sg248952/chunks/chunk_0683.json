Shared processor CFs can operate with different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models: Chapter 7. Operating system support 279 \u2013 DYNDISP=OFF: LPAR timeslicing completely controls the CF processor. \u2013 DYNDISP=ON: an optimization over pure LPAR timeslicing, in which the CFCC code manages timer interrupts to share processors more efficiently. \u2013 DYNDISP=THIN: An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts. Thin Interrupt support was available since zEC12/zBC12, and is proven to be efficient and well-performing in numerous different test and customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations. Therefore, IBM z15 has made",
