Because of the potential costs and overheads, most of the organizations avoid the use of host-based network encryption today. By using enhanced CPACF and SIMD on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, TLS and IPSec can use hardware performance gains while benefitting from transparent enablement. Reduced cost of",
