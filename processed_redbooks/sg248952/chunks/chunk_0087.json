Through their support of web services, XML, and Java, they allow for the modernization of assets in web-based applications. They also support the latest IBM middleware products (CICS, Db2, and IMS), which allows applications to use their latest capabilities. To fully use the capabilities of the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, you must compile it by using the minimum level of each compiler. To obtain the best performance, you must specify an architecture level of 14 by using the ARCH(14) option. For more information, see",
