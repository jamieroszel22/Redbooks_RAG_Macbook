Instructions are added in support of the Draft Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic - IEEE 754-2008, which is intended to supersede the ANSI/IEEE Standard 754-1985. \u0002 Allows COBOL programs that use zoned-decimal operations to take advantage of the z/Architecture DFP instructions. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ have two DFP accelerator units per core, which improve the decimal floating point execution bandwidth. The floating point instructions operate on newly designed vector registers (32 new 128-bit registers). IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ include decimal floating point packed conversion facility support with the following benefits: \u0002 Reduces code path length because extra instructions to format conversion are no longer",
