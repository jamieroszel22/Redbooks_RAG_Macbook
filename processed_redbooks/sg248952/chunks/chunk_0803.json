High-water mark Capacity that is purchased and owned by the client. 322 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide Installed record The LICCC record is downloaded, staged to the Support Element (SE), and is installed on the central processor complex (CPC). A maximum of eight different records can be concurrently installed. Model capacity identifier (MCI) Shows the current active capacity on the server, including all replacement and billable capacity. For IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, the model capacity identifier is in the form of A0x - Z0x, where x indicates the number of active CPs (x can have a range of 1 - 6). Model Permanent Capacity Identifier (MPCI) Keeps information about the capacity settings that are active before any temporary capacity is activated. Model Temporary Capacity Identifier (MTCI) Reflects the permanent capacity with billable capacity only, without replacement capacity. If no",
