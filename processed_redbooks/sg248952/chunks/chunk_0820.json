To order and activate the upgrade, log on to the IBM Resource Link website and start the CIU application to upgrade a system for processors or memory. You can request a client order approval to conform to your operational policies. You also can allow the definition of more IDs to be authorized to access the CIU. More IDs can be authorized to enter or approve CIU orders, or only view orders. Considerations: Client planning and operator action are required to use concurrent PU conversion. Consider the following points about PU conversion: \u0002 It is disruptive if all current PUs are converted to different types. \u0002 It might require individual LPAR outages if dedicated PUs are converted. Unassigned CP capacity is recorded by a model capacity identifier. CP feature conversions change (increase or decrease) the model capacity identifier. Chapter",
