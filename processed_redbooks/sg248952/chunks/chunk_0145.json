The characterized PUs can be used in general to run supported operating systems, such as z/OS, z/VM, and Linux on Z. They also can run specific workloads, such as Java, XML services, IPSec, and some Db2 workloads, or clustering functions, such as the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). The maximum number of characterizable PUs depends on the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ feature code: \u0002 FC 0672: Max5, two PU DCMs up to 5 characterizable PUs \u0002 FC 0673: Max16, two PU DCMs up to 16 characterizable PUs \u0002 FC 0674: Max32,",
