  "content": "IBM z16 AGZ. The new memory interface uses transparent memory encryption technology to protect all data leaving the processor chips before it's stored in the memory DIMMs. The encryption occurs post-RAIM encoding, the decryption occurs pre-RAIM decoding. That means the data is encrypted before being distributed according to the eight channel RAIM algorithm and written to the eight DIMMs forming a RAIM group, and the data is decrypted after being read from the DIMMs. 3.6.2 Main storage Main storage consist of memory space addressable by programs and storage that is not directly addressable by programs. Non-addressable storage includes the hardware system area (HSA). Main storage provides the following functions: \u0002 Data storage and retrieval for PUs and I/O \u0002 Communication with PUs and I/O \u0002 Communication with and control of optional expanded storage \u0002 Error checking and correction Main storage can be accessed by all processors, but cannot be shared between LPARs.
