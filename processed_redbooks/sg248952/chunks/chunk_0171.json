Chapter 2. Central processor complex hardware components 55 The PCIe switch card spreads the x16 PCIe bus to the PCIe I/O slots in the domain. In the PCIe+ I/O drawer, the two PCIe switch cards (LG06 and LG16, see Figure 2-23) provide a backup path (Redundant I/O Interconnect - RII) for each other through the passive connection in the PCIe+ I/O drawer backplane. Figure 2-23 PCIe+ I/O drawer locations To support Redundant I/O Interconnect (RII) between domain pair 0 and 1, the two interconnects to each pair must be driven from two different PCIe fanouts. Normally, each PCIe interconnect in a pair supports the eight features in its domain. In backup",
