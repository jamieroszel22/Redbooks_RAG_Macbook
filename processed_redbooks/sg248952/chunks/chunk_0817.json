Important: The LICCC-based PU conversions require that at least one PU (CP, ICF, or IFL), remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conversion is disruptive. The PU conversion generates a LICCC that can be installed concurrently in two steps: 1. Remove the assigned PU from the configuration. 2. Activate the newly available PU as the new PU type. 328 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide 8.2.2 Customer Initiated Upgrade facility The CIU facility is an IBM",
