Only the PUs purchased by a client are identified with a feature code. \u0002 All PU conversions can be performed concurrently. A capacity marker identifies the number of CPs that were purchased. This number of purchased CPs is higher than or equal to the number of CPs that is actively used. The capacity marker marks the availability of purchased but unused capacity that is intended to be used as CPs in the future. This status often is present for software-charging reasons. Unused CPs are not a factor when establishing the millions of service units (MSU) value that is used for charging monthly license charge (MLC) software, or when charged on a per-processor basis. 2.8.1 Upgrades Concurrent upgrades of CPs,",
