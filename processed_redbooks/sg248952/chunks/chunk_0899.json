  "content": "introduced with IBM z15 RAS designs are implemented on the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ design through the introduction of new technology, structure, and requirements. Continuous improvements in RAS are associated with new features and functions to ensure that IBM Z delivers exceptional value to clients. RAS can be accomplished with improved concurrent replace, repair, and upgrade functions for processors, memory, drawers, and I/O. RAS also extends to the nondisruptive capability for installing Licensed Internal Code (LIC) updates. In most cases, a capacity upgrade can be concurrent without a system outage. As an extension to the RAS capabilities, environmental controls are implemented in the system to help reduce power consumption and meet cooling requirements. The following overriding RAS requirements are principles as shown in Figure 9-1: \u0002 Inclusion of existing (or equivalent) RAS characteristics from previous generations. \u0002 Learn from current field issues and addressing the",
