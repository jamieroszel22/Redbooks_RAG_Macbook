  "content": "not reallocate any resources; instead, it produces only a report. The resources are not reallocated until the Perform Drawer Removal process is started. Rules during EDA During EDA, the following rules are enforced: \u0002 Processor rules All processors in any remaining drawers are available to be used during EDA. This requirement includes the two spare PUs or any available PU that is non-LICCC. The EDA process also allows conversion of one PU type to another PU type. One example is converting a zIIP to a CP during the EDA function. The preparation for the concurrent drawer replacement task indicates whether any SAPs must be moved to the remaining drawers. \u0002 Memory rules All physical memory that is installed in the system, including flexible memory, is available during the EDA function. Any physical installed memory, whether purchased or not, is available to be used by the EDA function. \u0002 Single I/O rules Alternative paths to other drawers must be available, or the I/O path must be taken",
