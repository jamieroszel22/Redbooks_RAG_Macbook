Also, a logical partition (LPAR) is now attached to a specific logical channel subsystem, which makes the extension of multiple logical channel subsystems not apparent to the operating systems and applications. The multiple image facility (MIF) in the structure enables resource sharing across LPARs within a single LCSS or across the LCSSs. The multiple LCSS structure extended the IBM Z\u2019 total number of I/O connectivity to support a balanced configuration for the growth of processor and I/O capabilities. A one-digit number ID starting from 0 (CSSID) is assigned to an LCSS, and a one-digit hexadecimal ID (MIF ID) starting from 0 is assigned to an LPAR within the LCSS. Subchannels A subchannel provides the logical appearance of a device to the program and contains the information that is required for sustaining a single I/O operation. Each device is accessible by using one subchannel in a channel subsystem to which it is assigned according to",
