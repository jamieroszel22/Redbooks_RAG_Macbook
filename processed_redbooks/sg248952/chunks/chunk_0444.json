  "content": "automatic MAC address generation to create uniqueness within and across LPARs and servers. The use of Group MAC addresses for multicast is supported, and broadcasts to all other Layer 2 devices on the same HiperSockets networks. Datagrams are delivered only between HiperSockets devices that use the same transport mode. A Layer 2 device cannot communicate directly to a Layer 3 device in another LPAR network. A HiperSockets device can filter inbound datagrams by VLAN identification, the destination MAC address, or both. Analogous to the Layer 3 functions, HiperSockets Layer 2 devices can be configured as primary or secondary connectors, or multicast routers. This configuration enables the creation of high-performance and high-availability link layer switches between the internal HiperSockets network and an external Ethernet network. It also can be used to connect to the HiperSockets Layer 2 networks of different servers. HiperSockets Layer 2 is supported by Linux on IBM Z, and by z/VM",
