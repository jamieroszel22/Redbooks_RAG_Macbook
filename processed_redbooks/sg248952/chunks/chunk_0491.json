It is installed on a PC and allows you to manage the physical and logical aspects of a mainframe\u2019s hardware configuration. \u0002 CHPID Mapping Tool (CMT) The CMT helps to map CHPIDs onto PCHIDs that are based on an IODF source file and the eConfig configuration file of a mainframe. It provides a CHPID to PCHID mapping with high availability for the targeted I/O configuration. It also features built-in mechanisms to generate a mapping according to customized I/O performance groups. More enhancements are implemented in CMT to support IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ configurations. The CMT is available for download from the IBM Resource Link website. The configuration file for a new machine or upgrade is also available from IBM Resource Link. Ask your IBM technical sales representative for the name of the file to download. Note:",
