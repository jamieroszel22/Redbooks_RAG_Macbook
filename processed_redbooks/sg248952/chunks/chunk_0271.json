Note: IFLs can be dedicated to a Linux, a z/VM, or LPAR, or can be shared by multiple Linux guests, z/VM LPARs, or SSC that are running on the same IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ. Only z/VM, Linux on Z operating systems, SSC, and designated software products can run on IFLs. IFLs are orderable by using FC 1959.

Central processor complex design 105 Unassigned ICFs New on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, an ICF that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned ICF (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present. The allowable number of ICFs and Unassigned ICFs for each feature is",
