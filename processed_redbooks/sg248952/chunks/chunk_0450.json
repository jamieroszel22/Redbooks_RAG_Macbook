I/O structure 179 Table 4-10 Coupling link options that are supported on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ The maximum number of combined external coupling links (active CE LR, ICA SR links) is 106 per IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ system. The IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ coupling link support summary is shown in Table 4-10. Consider the following points: \u0002 The maximum supported links depends on the IBM Z model or capacity feature code. \u0002 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ ICA SR maximum depends on the number of CPC drawers. A total of 12 PCIe+ fanouts are used per CPU drawer, which gives a maximum of 24 ICA SR ports. For more information about distance support for coupling links, see System z End-to-End Extended Distance Guide, SG24-8047.
