The kit provides hardware to enhance the ruggedness of the frame, the frame stiffener, and to tie down the frame to a concrete floor. The frame tie-down kit can be used on a non-raised floor where the frame is secured directly to a concrete floor, or on a raised floor where the frame is secured to the concrete floor underneath the raised floor. The kits help secure the frames and their contents from damage when they are exposed to shocks and vibrations, such as in a seismic event. Service clearance areas IBM z16 A02 requires specific service clearance to ensure the fastest possible repair in the unlikely event that a part must be replaced. Failure to provide enough clearance to open the front and rear covers results in extended service times or outages.
