  "content": "IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system. The 10GbE RoCE Express2 feature also is used by Linux on IBM Z for applications that are coded to the native RoCE verb interface or use Ethernet (such as TCP/IP). This native use does not require a peer OSA. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. Shared Memory Communication - Direct Memory Access First introduced with IBM z13 servers, the Shared Memory Communication - Direct Memory Access (SMC-D) feature maintains the socket-API transparency aspect of SMC-R so that applications that use TCPI/IP communications can benefit immediately without requiring application software to undergo IP topology changes. Similar to SMC-R, this protocol uses shared memory architectural concepts that eliminate TCP/IP",
