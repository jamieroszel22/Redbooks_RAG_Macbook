The SE code runs as a virtual guest of the Hardware Management Console code. Figure 10-14 on page 408 illustrates the HMA and relation to HMCs and SEs. Statement of Direction: IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ is planned to be the last server to support legacy CoD unique record type automation interfaces. For example, legacy command HWMCA_ACTIVATE_CBU_COMMAND has to change to HWMCA_ADD_CAPACITY_COMMAND. We suggest you to start now to change your automation scripts accordingly.
