  "content": "More CPC drawers can be installed concurrently, which allows further memory upgrades by LICCC, and enables memory capacity on the new CPC drawers. By using the previously defined reserved memory, z/OS operating system images, and z/VM partitions, you can dynamically configure more memory online. This process allows nondisruptive memory upgrades. Linux on IBM Z supports Dynamic Storage Reconfiguration. I/O I/O features can be added concurrently if all the required infrastructure (I/O slots and PCIe Fanouts) is present in the configuration. PCIe+ I/O drawers can be added concurrently without planning if free space is available in one of the frames and the configuration permits. Dynamic I/O configurations are supported by certain operating systems (z/OS and z/VM), which allows nondisruptive I/O upgrades. Dynamic I/O reconfiguration on a stand-alone coupling facility system is also possible using the Dynamic I/O activation for stand-alone CF CPCs features. Cryptographic adapters Crypto",
