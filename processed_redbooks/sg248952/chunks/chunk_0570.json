A TKE workstation is part of a customized solution for the use of the Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility for z/OS (ICSF for z/OS) or Linux for IBM Z. This program provides a basic key management system for the cryptographic keys of a IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ that has Crypto Express features installed. TKE provides compliant-level hardware-based HSM management mechanisms that clients want or must use when managing IBM Z and LinuxONE Crypto Express Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). TKE also provides mechanisms that simplify HSM management in complex IBM z Systems and LinuxONE cryptographic environments as much as regulations and policy will allow. The TKE does not have to be in the same location as the IBM Z or LinunxONE system that has the HSMs. However, the users need to have physical access to the TKE when managing IBM Z or LinuxONE HSMs. The TKE product is a Workstation with an HSM running a",
