Cryptographic features 235 6.8 Cryptographic operating system support for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ The following section gives an overview of the operating systems requirements in relation to cryptographic elements. 6.8.1 Crypto Express8S Exploitation For full exploitation of the new functions of Crypto Express8S (0908/0909) is supplied in ICFS PTFs on: \u0002 z/OS V2.5 (base, which is HCR77D2) \u0002 z/OS V2.2 to V2.4 (Web Deliverable HCR77D1) These ICSF support is required to administer a Crypto Express8S coprocessor using a TKE workstation, due to exploitation of quantum algorithms. All supported levels of ICSF automatically detect what HW cryptographic capabilities are available where it is running, then enables functions accordingly. No toleration support of new hardware is necessary. For",
