Considerations: Most of the MESs can be concurrently applied without disrupting the workload. For more information, see 8.2, \u201cPU upgrades\u201d on page 325. However, certain MES changes are non-concurrent; for example, CPC feature upgrades such as from IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Max5 or Max16 to a Max32 feature. Memory upgrades are only concurrent when the required memory capacity is already physical available and can be activated through LICCC. Prepaid OOCoD tokens: Beginning with IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, new prepaid OOCoD tokens that are purchased will not carry forward to future systems. 1 CPE is only available as carry forward on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Chapter 8.
