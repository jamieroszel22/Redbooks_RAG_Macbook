One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID). The 10GbE RoCE Express3 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector. Both point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class 10GbE switch are supported. 10GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0441 10GbE RoCE Express3 LR(FC 0441) is installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and is supported only on IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ. The 10GbE RoCE Express3 LR is a native PCIe feature. It does not use a CHPID and is defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement",
