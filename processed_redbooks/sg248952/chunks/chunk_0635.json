Operating system support is required to use this capability without an IPL; that is, nondisruptively. This support is available in z/OS for some time. The dynamic PU add function enhances this support by allowing you to dynamically define and change the number and type of reserved PUs in an LPAR profile, which removes any planning requirements. The new resources are immediately made available to the operating system and in the case of z/VM, to its guests. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. Dynamic LPAR memory upgrade An LPAR can be defined with an initial and a reserved amount of memory. At activation time, the initial amount is made available to the partition and the reserved amount can be added later, partially or totally. Although these two memory zones do not have to be contiguous in real memory, they appear as logically contiguous to",
