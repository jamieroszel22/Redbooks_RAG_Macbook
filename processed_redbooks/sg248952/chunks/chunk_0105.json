Quantum-safe cryptography refers to efforts to identify algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, to keep information assets secure even after a large-scale quantum computer has been built. Source: https://www.etsi.org/technologies/quantum-safe-cryptography.\u201d These algorithms are used to help ensure the integrity of a number of the firmware and boot processes. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are the Industry-first system protected by quantum-safe technology across multiple layers of firmware. 18 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide \u2013 OSA-Express7S 1.2 (new build only) \u2013 OSA-Express6S (carry forward only) \u2013 RoCE Express3 (new build only) \u2013 RoCE Express2.1 (carry forward only) \u2013 RoCE Express2 (carry forward only) \u0002 Cryptographic",
