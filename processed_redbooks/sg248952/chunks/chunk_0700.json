  "content": "about FICON channel performance, see the performance technical papers that are available at the IBM Z I/O connectivity page of the IBM IT infrastructure website. Modified Indirect Data Address Word facility The Modified Indirect Data Address Word (MIDAW) facility improves FICON performance. It provides a more efficient channel command word (CCW)/indirect data address word (IDAW) structure for certain categories of data-chaining I/O operations. The MIDAW facility is a system architecture and software feature that is designed to improve FICON performance. This facility was first made available on System z9 servers, and is used by the Media Manager in z/OS. The MIDAW facility provides a more efficient CCW/IDAW structure for certain categories of data-chaining I/O operations. MIDAW can improve FICON performance for extended format data sets. Non-extended data sets can also benefit from MIDAW. MIDAW can improve channel utilization and I/O response time. It also reduces FICON channel",
