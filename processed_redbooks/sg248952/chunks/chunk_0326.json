  "content": "profile. By using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task, you can add crypto adapters dynamically to an LPAR without an outage of the LPAR. Also, dynamic deletion or moving of these features does not require pre-planning. Support is provided in z/OS, z/VM, 21CS VSEn, Secure Service Container (based on appliance requirements), and Linux on Z. LPAR dynamic PU reassignment The system configuration is enhanced to optimize the PU-to-CPC drawer assignment of physical processors dynamically. The initial assignment of client-usable physical processors to physical processor drawers can change dynamically to better suit the LPAR configurations that are in use. For more information, see 3.5.9, \u201cProcessor unit assignment\u201d on page 113. Swapping of specialty engines and general processors with each other, with spare PUs, or with both, can occur as the system attempts to compact LPAR configurations into physical configurations that span the least number of processor drawers.
