The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation support allows a port group of OSA-Express features to span multiple virtual switches within a single z/VM system or between multiple z/VM systems. Sharing a Link Aggregation Port Group (LAG) with multiple virtual switches increases optimization and utilization of the OSA-Express features when handling larger traffic loads. Higher adapter utilization protects customer investments, which is increasingly important as 10 GbE deployments become more prevalent. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 255 and Table 7-9 on page 257. Large send for IPv6 packets Large send for IPv6 packets improves performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express feature by using a more",
