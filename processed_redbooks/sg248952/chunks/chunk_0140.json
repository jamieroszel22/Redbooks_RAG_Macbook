It uses the following combinations of Power Supply Units (PSUs), Point of Load (POLs), Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs), and Processor Power Control Cards (PPCs): \u0002 PSUs: Provide AC conversions to 12V DC bulk/standby power and are installed at the rear of the CPC. There are four PSUs (N+1 redundancy) connected to the PDUs. \u0002 POLs: Five N+2 redundant cards are installed next to the Memory DIMMs. \u0002 VRMs: three modules (N+2 redundancy).
