A physical MES upgrade requires an IBM SSRs for the installation. To better use the MES upgrade function, carefully plan the initial configuration to allow a concurrent upgrade to a target configuration. The availability of I/O drawers improves the flexibility to perform unplanned I/O configuration changes concurrently.
