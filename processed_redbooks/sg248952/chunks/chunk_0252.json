Cobol and PL/I compilers were updated to support the new IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ enhancements: \u0002 BCD to HFP conversions \u0002 Numeric editing operation \u0002 Zoned decimal operations Software support DFP is supported in the following programming languages and products: \u0002 Release 4 and later of the High Level Assembler \u0002 C/C++, which requires supported z/OS version \u0002 Enterprise PL/I Release 3.7 and Debug Tool Release 8.1 or later \u0002 Java Applications that use the BigDecimal Class Library \u0002 SQL support as of Db2 Version 9 and later Chapter 3.
