  "content": "ensures continued operation of the server without interruption. Depending on system configuration (number of CPC drawers and/or PCIe+ I/O drawers), the IBM z16 A02 can have two or four PDUs installed. PDUs cannot be ordered separately; instead, they are always determined by the system configuration and are factory installed. Power consumption The utility power consumption for the IBM z16 A02 depends on a number of things: \u0002 Number of installed PU DCM\u2019s / CPC drawers and installed amount of memory \u0002 Number of installed PCIe+ I/O drawers and the number of cards in those drawers \u0002 Environmental conditions in the data center The Installation Guide for Physical Planning on the Resource Link website contains several tables that give an indication of the power consumption for several generic configurations. For specific configurations the Power & weight estimation tool, also on Resource Link, can be used to estimate a more precise power consumption based on the configuration and data center",
