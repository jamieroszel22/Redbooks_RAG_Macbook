While the zEDC PCIe feature provided CPU savings by offloading the select compression and decompression operations, it had also the drawback of limited virtualization capabilities (one zEDC PCIe feature could be shared across a maximum of 15 LPARs) as well as limited bandwidth. IBM z15 introduced for the first time an on-chip accelerator (implemented in the PU chip) for compression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor\u2019s L3 cache, thus providing much higher bandwidth as well as removing the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature.
