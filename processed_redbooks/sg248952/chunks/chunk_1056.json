  "content": "rack and any cabling best practices. Power requirements The IBM z16 AGZ is designed to have a fully redundant power system, using redundant PDUs. PDUs must be installed in pairs. To make full use of the redundancy that is built into the server, the PDUs within one pair must be powered from different power distribution panels. In that case, if one PDU in a pair fails, the second PDU ensures continued operation of the server without interruption. Depending on system configuration (number of CPC drawers and/or PCIe+ I/O drawers), the IBM z16 AGZ can have two or four PDUs installed which the customer must provide. Power consumption The utility power consumption for the IBM z16 AGZ depends on a number of things: \u0002 the number of installed PU DCMs / CPC drawers and installed amount of memory \u0002 the number of installed PCIe+ I/O drawers and the number of cards in those drawers \u0002 the environmental conditions in the data center The Implementation Guide for Physical Planning on the Resource Link",
