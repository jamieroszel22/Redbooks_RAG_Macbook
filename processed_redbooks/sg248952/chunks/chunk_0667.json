All online real storage over 4 TB is part of the 2 GB LFAREA, in addition to what was specified in LFAREA. Real memory is available only for 2 GB pages. Applications that make use of 2 GB frames should be reviewed to use more frames if applicable, e.g. Java, Db2. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. AI accelerator exploitation With the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Integrated Accelerator for AI, clients can benefit from the acceleration of AI operations such as fraud detection, customer behavior predictions and, streamlining of supply chain operations - all in real time. AI accelerator is designed to deliver AI inference in real time, at large scale and rate,",
