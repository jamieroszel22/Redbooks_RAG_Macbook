  "content": "buffer areas. This process is sometimes known as scatter-read or scatter-write. However, as technology evolves and link speed increases, data chaining techniques become less efficient because of switch fabrics, control unit processing and exchanges, and other issues. 9 Exceptions are made to this statement, and many details are omitted in this description. In this section, we assume that you can merge this brief description with an understanding of I/O operations in a virtual memory environment. 286 IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ Technical Guide The MIDAW facility is a method of gathering and scattering data from and into discontinuous storage locations during an I/O operation. The MIDAW format is shown in Figure 7-3. It is 16 bytes long and aligned on a quadword. Figure 7-3 MIDAW format An example of MIDAW usage is shown in Figure 7-4. Figure 7-4 MIDAW usage The use of MIDAWs is indicated by the MIDAW bit in the CCW. If this bit is set, the skip flag cannot be set in the CCW. The skip",
