All processor types of an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can be dynamically reassigned, except IFPs. Memory allocation changed from the previous IBM Z servers. Partition memory is now allocated based on processor drawer affinity. For more information, see \u201cMemory allocation\u201d on page 116. Logical processors are dispatched by PR/SM on physical processors. The assignment topology that is used by PR/SM to dispatch logical processors on physical PUs is also based on cache usage optimization. Processor drawers assignment is more important because they optimize virtual L4 cache usage. Therefore, logical processors from a specific LPAR are packed into a processor drawer as much as possible. PR/SM optimizes chip assignments within the assigned processor drawer (or drawers) to",
