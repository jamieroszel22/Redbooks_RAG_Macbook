These instructions are known as Message-Security Assist (MSA). When enabled, the CPACF runs at processor speed for every CP, IFL, and zIIP. For more information about MSA instructions, see z/Architecture Principles of Operation, SA22-7832. For activating these functions, the CPACF must be enabled by using feature code (FC) 3863, which is available for no extra charge. Support for hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 is always enabled. 6.4.1 Cryptographic synchronous functions Because the CPACF works",
