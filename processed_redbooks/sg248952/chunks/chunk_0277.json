For more information about CFCC Level 25 enhancements, see 7.4.3, \u201cCoupling and clustering features and functions\u201d on page 276. 3.5.5 IBM Z Integrated Information Processor (FC 1961) A zIIP10 reduces the standard processor (CP) capacity requirements for z/OS Java, XML system services applications, and a portion of work of z/OS Communications Server and Db2 UDB for z/OS Version 8 or later, which frees up capacity for other workload requirements. A zIIP enables eligible z/OS workloads to have a portion of them directed for execution to a processor that is characterized as a zIIP. Because the zIIPs do not increase the MSU value of the processor, they do not affect the IBM software license changes. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are the fourth generation of IBM Z processors to support SMT. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ implement two threads per core on IFLs and",
