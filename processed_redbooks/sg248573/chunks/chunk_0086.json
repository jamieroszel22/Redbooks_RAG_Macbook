IBM watsonx.data allows users to access data in existing data warehouses and data lakes through predefined platform connectors, including Teradata, Snowflake, SingleStore, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, IBM Db2, and IBM Netezza. This solution reduces data duplication, and the costs associated with storing data in multiple locations.

In that case, it can be accessed directly if the data is in Iceberg or Delta Format. If the data is stored in other common formats like Parquet or CSV, it can be accessed in its native format, followed by running ETL jobs to convert it to the open format like Iceberg and brought into the platform.
