Existing use cases Will this foundation model allow us to execute existing use cases better/cheaper/faster? How? How much? How well does it align with our strategic imperatives? Consider the following factors, and the interplay between them: \u0002 Improve the accuracy of an existing application. \u0002 Improve legal indemnification for an existing application. \u0002 Improve the ease of governing one or more existing applications. \u0002 Reduce AI ethics risk for an existing application. \u0002 Reduce inferencing costs for an existing application. \u0002 Reduce energy consumption for an existing application. New use cases Will this foundation model allow us to enable new use cases? How? How much? How well does it align with our strategic imperatives? For example: \u0002 The new model has been tuned to handle IT optimization use cases better than",
