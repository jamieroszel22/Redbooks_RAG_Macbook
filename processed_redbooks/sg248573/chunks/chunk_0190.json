Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 71 Inventory and AI use case setup AI Inventories are used to hold AI use cases. These Inventories are agnostic to asset type - a generative AI use case can be held in the same inventory as a traditional ML/AI use case. Inventory setup This notebook from IBM's github showcases how to create an AI Inventory. This sample notebook demonstrates a variety of functionality including: \u0002 Open a new AI inventory \u0002 Add collaborators \u0002 Delete inventory \u0002 Modify existing inventories Because the AI Inventory concept is native to watsonx.governance, it is always implemented",
