Across these requests, common statistical attributes like minimum, maximum, mean, and median of the number of records are also calculated. It is also important to know how much time is taken by the system to process a record and/or a request. Similarly, watsonx.governance can also measure throughput of the system by looking at the number of records and requests processed in a second. For generative AI-based deployments, the input and output token counts processed across the scoring requests can be visualized as well. If there are multiple users registered on the system and using the deployments, watsonx.governance can also present the real-time view to see the total number of users and the aggregated views to see the average number of users. 6.2.4 Generative AI quality To assess the quality of the content generated by a prompt,",
