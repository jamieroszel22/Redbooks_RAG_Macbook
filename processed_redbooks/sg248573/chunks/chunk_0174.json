  "content": "watsonx.governance has many Generative AI Quality metrics. Some of these metrics work in the presence of a reference input and hence work off the feedback data. However, there are reference free metrics as well, that do not require any reference input and can be calculated on the production data. IBM watsonx.governance also allows the use of widely available LLM models to evaluate the performance of the user prompts through the LLM-as-a-judge feature. 6.2.5 RAG quality metrics By adding external sources of context to the prompt of an LLM, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance the quality of the content generated by the model. With this perspective in place, watsonx.governance can monitor both the phases of a RAG-based system. The retrieval phase can be assessed by looking at the context pulled and seeing how relevant it is to the question asked by the user (context relevance). By looking at retrieval precision, one can tell if the retrieved information is directly",
