With generative AI and foundation models, this is typically no longer the case as these models are now pre-trained to handle a large variety of use cases. Not only does this mean a one-to-many relationship, but the relationship is also reversed: the model is already there before any specific use cases are considered. One result of this is that the use case has become more important as a governed item in its own right, separate from the (foundation) models applied to deliver a use case. Chapter 5 describes the governance considerations around use cases 10 Ensuring Trustworthy AI with IBM watsonx.governance More AI assets In machine learning and deep learning projects, typically the asset created was a trained model. Depending on the use case and the data, these can take many forms but they're generally all referred to as models. With generative AI and",
