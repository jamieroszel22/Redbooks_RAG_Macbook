There are many ways to explain these models and systems, the appropriate choice depends on the usage context and type of explanation that is needed by the consumer of the explanation. 4.3.5 Robustness An AI system is considered robust if it can continue to perform well and reliably even when faced with difficult or unexpected situations.
