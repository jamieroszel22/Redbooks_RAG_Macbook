Lifecycle governance of third-party ML models deployed on other platforms can be implemented through python code. IBM watsonx.governance provides all of the tools and methods necessary to achieve lifecycle governance regardless of where the asset exists. Section 6.4.2, \u201cConsiderations for lifecycle governance for traditional ML hosted on watsonx.ai\u201d on page 70 introduces the tools which will be used to achieve these goals. Many of the same steps apply when implementing lifecycle governance for ML assets deployed on other platforms.
