The pre-trained nature of foundation models allows us to create a more focused view on the lifecycle of AI assets being used in use cases. This lifecycle can be generally depicted with three chronological stages: Develop stage, Validate stage, and Operate stage. Figure 6-2 on page 63 highlights the general lifecycle stages in a red box. Chapter 6. Governing the end-to-end lifecycle of an AI asset 63 Figure 6-2 A Sample Lifecycle Diagram Within each stage of this AI lifecycle, actions should be taken by users to progress the AI asset through its lifecycle. The following section covers the high-level activities that take place within each of the three stages. Development stage In the development stage, users must work to stand up the initial AI use",
