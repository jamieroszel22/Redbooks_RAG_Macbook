Disconnect from MONWRITE: ===> #cp disc The CLOSE 480 statement tells MONWRITE to close the output file every 8 hours (480 minutes), starting from midnight. It means, regardless of when it starts recording, that it will close the file at 08:00, at 16:00, and at 24:00. The file name will clearly show the date and time when the recording started. To collect MONWRITE data automatically, start the MONWRITE virtual machine when you IPL z/VM. Add a line to the PROFILE EXEC of the AUTOLOG1 191 disk (or AUTOLOG2 191 if an external security manager, such as RACF, is running): ===> x profile exec ... \"CP XAUTOLOG MONWRITE\" /* Start the MONWRITE VM */ ... The MONWRITE\u2019s A-disk is shipped as 300 cylinders, which is small. Depending on the monitor interval activity of the system and the number of samples/events, it can fill quickly.
