The audit records must be managed through the RACFSMF virtual machine. To create a PROFILE EXEC for the RACFSMF virtual machine, complete the following steps: 1. Link the RACFSMF 191 disk read/write and access it as file mode H: ===> link racfsmf 191 2191 mr ===> acc 2191 h 2. Copy the sample profile SMFPROF EXEC to the RACFSMF 191 disk (H) as the file PROFILE EXEC: ===> copy smfprof exec g profile = h 3. Edit the PROFILE EXEC and change the value",
