In user-based mode, a guest is permitted or denied to connect to a VSWITCH, and all ports that are connected to a VSWITCH feature the same access characteristics (such as ACCESS or TRUNK mode, and VLAN memberships). In port-based mode, a guest is granted access to connect to specific port numbers on a VSWITCH, and those ports might include different configured access characteristics. When DNA is enabled, all VSWITCHes operate like the previous port-based mode. A port definition that corresponds to the access that us implied through the NICDEF directory entry is automatically defined for a guest when that virtual NIC connects to the VSWITCH. DNA is the default operation mode for VSWITCHes on a system where the APAR is installed. Therefore, setting up an interconnect network can now be done by creating: \u0002 A VSWITCH (the old way) \u0002 A VLAN on an existing VSWITCH (the new \u201cDNA-enabled\u201d way) 14.1.2 Creating a VSWITCH for interconnect An",
