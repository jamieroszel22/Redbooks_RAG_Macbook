  "content": "2.9.3 Network attachment options and considerations The use of z/VM Virtual Network Switches (VSWITCH) is the IBM recommended practice. It features less computational expense than the other alternatives. When it is correctly configured, it provides built-in fail-over. It also supports 802.1q VLAN by port, 802.1q VLAN by user, port isolation, and 802.3ad link aggregation. VSWITCH interfaces The VSWITCH type of network is provided to z/VM VM systems by z/VM. During the installation phase, a basic VSWITCH is configured. VSWITCHES are software switches that offer many of the capabilities that are provided by a real switch. The IBM recommended configuration for z/VM VSWITCHES is ETHERNET mode, which is also frequently referred to as Layer 2. Ethernet-based networks are currently used for most z/VM installations that run Linux as a VM operating system. Under virtually all circumstances, z/VM VSWITCHES must be configured as ETHERNET/Layer 2. Characteristics of VSWITCH interfaces VSWITCH",
