Therefore, more HYPERPAV alias devices can be set up than are physically configured in the environment. \u0002 When you use HYPERPAV, only full-pack minidisks, including cylinder 0, can be used. To prevent abuse, you can attach the real DASD with the DEVNO statement at the MDISK definition instead of using a volume ID (volid). To further improve system security with this specific type of minidisks, do not enable minidisks for users in SYSTEM",
