The error reason \u201cLACP not enabled on partner\u201d is shown against both of the OSA ports in the group. Only an exclusive-mode port group can operate without LACP, and in that configuration, traffic for the group is distributed between the ports in the group without being managed by a control protocol. Depending on the operating characteristics of the network switch, this configuration might result in traffic not being handled optimally. Some modern network equipment can operate poorly and even experience traffic loss when traffic appears across different ports unexpectedly. Red Hat",
