  "content": "same device (HyperPAV), it is possible to use a real volume\u2019s alias devices to run more than one virtual machine I/O at a time on the volume. This capability helps to prevent I/O operations from blocking one another, which can result in virtual machine I/O operations with reduced response time, which in turn allows the workload on virtual machines to run more quickly. For more information about HyperPAV, see 11.2.5, \u201cHyperPAV\u201d on page 358.

The actual Model-54 size is debated, but it helps to know that Model-54 came with DS8000. Model-54 is configured with DS8000 as 3390-A. Model-27 is considered half of the size of a Model-54. 348 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 11.2.2 Direct-attached Fibre Channel Storage area networks (SANs) are specialized networks that are dedicated",
