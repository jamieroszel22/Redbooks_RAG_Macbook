  "content": "important that you can measure performance data from within the Linux guest itself. To monitor Linux performance data at this level, a data gatherer process must be running within each Linux guest that you want to monitor. Different ways of gathering this data are available. Many commercial and non-commercial solutions exist for long-term monitoring, also. This book cannot cover all of the requirements for long-term monitoring (low CPU consumption, data storage, and so on). This chapter shows how to monitor Linux performance for short periods, especially when you are troubleshooting performance problems.
