This process shows that the HiperSockets device is working. 14.3 Configuring a port group by using Link Aggregation Control Protocol To aggregate multiple OSA-Express ports, port groups can be defined on z/VM and attached to a virtual switch. Traffic is distributed over the multiple ports automatically. The initial support for VSwitch Link Aggregation required that the OSA ports were used only by a single z/VM VSWITCH and were not shared with another system (even a Linux guest in the same LPAR attaching to the OSA directly). Later, the Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation capability was introduced. This support, also known as Global VSwitch, allows a port group to be",
