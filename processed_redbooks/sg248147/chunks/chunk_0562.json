This capability is known as live guest relocation (LGR). While Linux systems continue to run, they can be moved across logical partitions (LPARs) on the same central processor complex (CPC), or cross-CPC, if the SSI is set up that way. This new function allows for few or even no planned outages. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of LGR and information about how to relocate a Linux guest.
