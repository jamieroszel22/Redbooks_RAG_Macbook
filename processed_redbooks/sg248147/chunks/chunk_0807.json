Virtual processors that are running in the snapshot period are marked with an RNN where NN is the processor number they are on. An R without a number means that the virtual processor is ready to run, but no processor is available. Other states are documented in the help for IND Q EXP. You do not need to be concerned about the other columns unless detailed analysis is required or if IBM support requests it. Also, always remember that this output is only a snapshot in time. Repeating this command over time gives you a more accurate picture of your z/VM system. A single snapshot cannot be regarded as indicative. Note: The virtual machine that issues the INDICATE command will always be one of the running machines. 374 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 CP INDICATE ACTIVE Use INDICATE ACTIVE to display: \u0002 The total amount of active users in a specific time \u0002 The number of users in",
