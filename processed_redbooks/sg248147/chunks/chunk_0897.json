This example uses four-port OSA express cards, which use two ports for each CHPID (see Figure 14-1 on page 422). 422 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 Figure 14-1 Port group Priv01 connectivity ITSOZVM1 port group priv1 has the following details: CHPID 00 portnumber 1 OSA device 2106 CHPID 01 portnumber 1 OSA device 2126 ITSOZVM2 port group priv1 has the following details: CHPID 00 portnumber 1 OSA device 2046 CHPID 01 portnumber 1 OSA device 2066 Use the following steps to accomplish this task: 1. Create the port group on the first SSI member (ITSOZVM1 in this example): ===> set port group priv01 join 2106.p01 2126.p01 2. Create the port group on the second SSI member (ITSOZVM2 in this example): ===> set port group priv01 join 2046.p01 2066.p01 3. Define the",
