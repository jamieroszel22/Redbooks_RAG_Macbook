Volume 1 starts with a solution orientation, discusses planning and security, and then, describes z/VM installation methods, configuration, hardening, automation, servicing, networking, optional features, and more. It adopts a \u201ccookbook-style\u201d format that provides a concise, repeatable set of procedures for installing, configuring, administering, and maintaining z/VM. This volume also includes a chapter on monitoring z/VM and the Linux virtual servers that are hosted. Volumes 2, 3, and 4 assume that you completed all of the steps that are described in Volume 1. From that common foundation, these volumes describe how to create your own Linux virtual servers on IBM Z hardware under IBM z/VM. The cookbook",
