Configuring dual adapters with multipathing by using dual fabrics is considered mandatory by the authors of this book. \u0002 The setup of the disks in the disk storage subsystem and the zoning of the adapters involve many worldwide port numbers (WWPNs). Meticulous attention to detail is critical to a successful outcome and special care must be taken. \u0002 For IBM Z, any supported FCP adapter, such as FICON Express or FICON",
