  "content": "Planning and Administration, SC24-6178, includes the following information: \u201cIn A VMSSI cluster, system-defined locally administered MAC addresses are created by using the prefix value that is specified on the MACPREFIX operand. The MACPREFIX value must be different for each member of the cluster. The default value is 02xxxx, where xxxx is the member\u2019s slot number on the SSI statement. If the MACPREFIX value is explicitly defined, the VMLAN statement must be qualified for the member to which it applies. Therefore, if a VMLAN statement with the MACPREFIX operand is retained from the non-SSI system or created in this step, it must be qualified for member VMSYS01.\u201d Chapter 2.
