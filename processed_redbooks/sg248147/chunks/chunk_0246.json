Even virtual machines on the same hardware offer EAL4 certification. 4.2.3 Typical RHOCP deployments and Topologies Based on the use case, you can have different deployment and topologies with RHOCP: \u0002 Deploying RHOCP as the only cloud environment on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE. \u0002 Deploying RHOCP with another, non-containerized workload that you also run as back-end in a z/VM environment with Linux servers on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE hardware. \u0002 Deploying RHOCP in colocation with a traditional operating and transactional environment and services, such as z/OS, z/VSE, or z/TPF on IBM Z hardware. 4.2.4 Production environment Because of a design with High Availability in mind, an RHOCP cluster must be deployed",
