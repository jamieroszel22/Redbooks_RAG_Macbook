Determining processors or CPUs To see how many processors (central processors (CPs), Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFLs), and CPUs) are allocated at system level, use the QUERY PROCESSORS command, for example: ===> q proc PROCESSOR 00 MASTER CP PROCESSOR 01 ALTERNATE CP PROCESSOR 02 ALTERNATE CP Note: The results of this command are based on the CP Class your user ID has based on the role. If you are a System Admin, you might have classes A, B, and C and see the z/VM amount of storage (memory). However, if you have only class G, it shows the user ID",
