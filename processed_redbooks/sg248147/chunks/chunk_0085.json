With nearly six decades of continual optimization, enhancement, and refinement of the hardware and z/VM, the result is a premium, high-performance solution: the ultimate virtualization platform. The following most notable qualities are features: \u0002 Incredible I/O capabilities Throughput speeds approach 1 terabyte per second. Unlike other virtualization platforms, z/VM guest systems commonly use real hardware access without another software layer. The platform is referred to by many in the industry as \u201can I/O monster\u201d because of this superior quality. \u0002 Engineered for availability The hardware components in the systems are double, sometimes even triple redundant, with a mean time to failure of over 50 years. If a component problem occurs, often you do not know about it until an IBM service",
