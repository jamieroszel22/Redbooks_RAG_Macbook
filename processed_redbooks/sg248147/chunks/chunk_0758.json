Although it is not possible to attach the same FCP adapter to two different z/VM virtual machine systems, it is important to maintain accurate records that show the adapter that is dedicated to each virtual machine. Configuring z/VM to use direct-attached Fibre Channel To be able to relocate a running Linux virtual machine with FCP devices from one LPAR to another, FCP device numbers on each LPAR must be the same and the equivalency identifier (EQID) must be set up. To create an EQID dynamically, run the SET RDEVICE command on each single system image (SSI) LPAR where Linux needs to relocate. Complete the following steps: 1. Log on as MAINT. 2.
