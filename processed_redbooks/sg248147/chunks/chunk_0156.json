Therefore, we are choosing to correctly segment the file systems in a way that provides stability, easier recovery from potential mistakes or accidents, and affords easy expansion when necessary \u0002 One of the single most prevalent bad practices is to deploy a Linux system with everything in one file system. Frequently, we hear LVM used as a justification for having done so. Consider the following points: \u2013 A false belief exists that deploying in one file system that uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM) mitigates the future trap this creates. This belief is not true. \u2013 When the root (/) file system becomes full, Linux kernel panics and crashes. An LVM saves you only from this situation if good monitoring is used and",
