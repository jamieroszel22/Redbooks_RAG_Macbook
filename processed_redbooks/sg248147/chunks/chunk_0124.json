  "content": "work hard. 1.9 Critical differences of LOGOFF versus DISCONNECT This topic might seem like a simple topic that does not require mentioning, but a critical difference exists between these two commands that you must understand: \u0002 LOGOFF If you log off, the session is ended, but not in the way you might expect. When the ID or VM is running CMS, issuing the LOGOFF command is analogous to cleanly shutting down and powering off a desktop or notebook computer. When the ID or VM is running Linux, issuing the LOGOFF command is analogous to pulling the electrical cord out of the outlet from a desktop computer, or ripping the battery out of a notebook that is not plugged in. The Linux file system journal is then left in an inconsistent state and the risk of file system corruption or loss of data is introduced.
