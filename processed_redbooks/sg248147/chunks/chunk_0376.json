Copying the RACFVM 200 and 300 minidisks To copy the RACFVM 200 and 300 minidisks to the volumes that will be shared, complete the following steps: 1. Log on to the first SSI member as MAINT: ===> logon maint by ibmvm1 2. Attach the DASD volumes that will be shared: ===> q 103B 113B DASD 103B NW103B , DASD 113B NW113B ===> att 103B 113B * 0200 0300 ATTACHED TO MAINT 3. Change the label with the CPFMTXA command so that the second character is \u201cR\u201d to signify RACF. The second character must not be \u201cM\u201d for minidisk or it will be attached to SYSTEM at z/VM IPL time: ===> cpfmtxa 103b jr103b label ... VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER IS NOW = JR103B ICK00001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, HIGHEST CONDITION CODE WAS 0 ... ===> cpfmtxa 113b jr113b label ... VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER IS NOW",
