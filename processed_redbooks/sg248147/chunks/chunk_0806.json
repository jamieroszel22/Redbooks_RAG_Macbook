Do not worry about the values in parentheses. INDICATE QUEUES EXP Another useful command to help you understand the state of the system is the INDICATE QUEUES EXP command, for example: ===> ind q exp MAINT Q1 R00 00001623/00001552 .I.. .0004 TCPIP Q0 PS 00003496/00003178 .I.. 99999 This class E command displays the virtual processors that are associated with a specific virtual machine (that can have multiple virtual processors), the queue (dispatch list, eligible list, or limit list) that they are in, and their states. This view is a snapshot in time. Again, you want to check this output to ensure that no virtual machines are in the eligible list.
