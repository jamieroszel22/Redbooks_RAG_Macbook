Therefore, dasdfmt overwrites the volume serial with 0xyyyy where yyyy is the virtual device number. To solve this issue, use minidisk assignment by device number. \u0002 The number of virtual HyperPAV aliases that is defined in one virtual machine for one logical control unit cannot be higher that the number of real aliases in that logical control unit\u2019s pool of aliases. It does not matter whether all virtual HyperPAV aliases in the virtual machine are defined to one base device or whether they are spread among several devices, they all act as one pool of aliases for a specific logical control unit. For example, assume that a logical control unit exists with 20 real devices and 20 aliases in a HyperPAV pool. We want to define four Linux images (each image with five real devices). To configure each Linux for the maximum",
