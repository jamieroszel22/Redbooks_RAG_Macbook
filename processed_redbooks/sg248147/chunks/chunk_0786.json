This mapping results in the physical OSA ports 2104-2013 being dedicated specifically to the user LINUX3 and appearing as virtual OSA ports 0AD0-0AD3.

DEDICATE 0AD0 2104 DEDICATE 0AD1 2105 DEDICATE 0AD2 2103 This mapping also can be accomplished by using the following DirMaint commands: DIRMAINT FOR LINUX3 DEDICATE 0AD0 2104 DIRMAINT FOR LINUX3 DEDICATE 0AD1 2105 DIRMAINT FOR LINUX3 DEDICATE 0AD2 2103 11.3.4 Configuring z/VM to provide HiperSockets network interfaces The rules for numbering devices for HiperSockets are the same as the rules for numbering devices for OSA. However, ensure that each triplet is used only one time within a CSS. Example 11-9 shows an entry in the user directory for the triple 5500, 5501, and 5502 that maps to only the same device addresses. Example 11-9 User directory entry for numbering devices for",
