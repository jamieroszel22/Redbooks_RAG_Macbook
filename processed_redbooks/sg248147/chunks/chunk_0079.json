IBM z/VM supports the Linux operating systems on IBM Z and LinuxONE servers. In this section, we describe the concepts of virtualization and cloud computing. Virtualization Virtualization is the ability of a computer system to share resources so that one physical server machine can act as many virtual servers. Unlike other hardware platforms, IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE operate on virtualized hardware by default, which results in incredible performance and efficiency. Virtualization is the way to consolidate the amount of hardware, floor space, and energy consumption in the data center. It also simplifies the procedures to provide reliable, highly available, and seamless",
