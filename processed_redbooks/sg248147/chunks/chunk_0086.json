Reductions in software licensing costs, power usage, cooling, and a fraction of the floor space versus distributed platforms. \u0002 Ultra-low TCO When workloads are evaluated from a total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective especially, workloads that are hosted under z/VM on the IBM Z or LinuxONE hardware mainframe have such a dramatic savings benefit to a bottom line that many customers consider this solution to be a competitive secret. 1.2.3 Optimized for Linux When Linux came to the previous generation of IBM Z in 2000, it was a natural fit to run under z/VM. You can run hundreds of Linux VMs (servers) in the same logical partition (LPAR) under z/VM, restricted only by the",
