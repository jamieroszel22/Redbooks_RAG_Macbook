It is likely that not only are such resources often not available, but also that over-provisioning results in needless rework or potential performance problems for you in the future. For more information about memory planning, see the following resources: \u0002 Linux on IBM System z: Performance Measurement and Tuning, SG24-6926 \u0002 IBM z/VM Performance Resources \u0002 For z/VM 6.3 and newer Releases After you determine the INITIAL value that you plan to use for each LPAR, also always define RESERVED storage, even if you think that you will not require it immediately. By defining RESERVED storage, you can dynamically increase the amount of memory that",
