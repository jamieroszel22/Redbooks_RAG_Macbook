Note: Consider the following points: \u0002 Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is set as active, by default. To use LACP, the network switch needs LACP to be active on the ports to which the CHPIDs connect. If LACP is not active in the switch, the port group does not activate when it is defined to a VSWITCH. \u0002 If you receive message HCPSWU2832E, the LPAR does not have exclusive use of the device. Another LPAR has the device online. However, exclusive use does not require that only one LPAR in the I/O configuration data set (IOCDS) has the CHPID defined and the devices dedicated.
