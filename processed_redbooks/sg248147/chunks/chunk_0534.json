Disaster-level backup and recovery is available for z/VM and the Linux guests. The Linux virtual machines are backed up as part of the z/VM system on which they are hosted. Equally, the TSM client code is backed up with the Linux virtual machines, which allows the TSM solution to perform its needed functions when the Linux virtual machine is again operational. In addition, file level backup and recovery also is available for z/VM and the Linux guests, which provides easier recovery from operational errors. IBM offers different and sometimes complementary strategies, such as IBM Backup and Restore Manager for z/VM and IBM Tivoli\u00ae Storage Manager (TSM) for Linux (see Figure 6-19) that can be part of your backup and restore master plan.",
