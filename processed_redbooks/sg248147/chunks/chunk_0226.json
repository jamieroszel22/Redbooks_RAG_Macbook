  "content": "such an ID became compromised, a significant risk to the system can result. One of the simplest areas where risk can be reduced is by removing security administration access from the system administration IDs. Security administration is not likely to be a daily task because a system that is established does not need frequent security changes. Also, changes that are needed can often be done automatically by using tools (such as the DirMaint-RACF connector as described in \u201cDirMaint-RACF Connector\u201d on page 321) to mirror directory changes into RACF. Important: It is vital to ensure that IBMVM1 is used only as a modeling template for the setup of administration IDs on your system. IBMVM1 must never be used for someone to log on to the system. Note: Some tasks are sufficiently complex that they must be done by using the supplied ID; for example, z/VM service by using VMSES/E that uses the MAINT720 ID. Other tasks, such as System SSL certificate maintenance by using the GSKADMIN ID, are",
