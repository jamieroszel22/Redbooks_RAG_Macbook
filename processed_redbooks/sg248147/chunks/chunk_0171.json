  "content": "multiple CHPIDs to each DASD controller that holds paging volumes. Consider two, four, or eight CHPIDs per controller, even if IBM Fibre Channel connection (FICON) is used because this approach can substantially increase throughput. \u0002 If Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) CHPIDs exist and SCSI DASD controllers are installed, you might consider them for paging. A SCSI logical unit number (LUN) that is defined to the z/VM system as an EDEV and is attached by using ATTACH to SYSTEM for paging allows the z/VM control program to overlap I/Os to it. You can achieve paging I/O concurrency without the need for multiple volumes. However, this approach includes a penalty of increased processor cycles. If you are CPU-constrained, do not take this route. The number of physical unit (PU) cycles that are required for each I/O to perform EDEV versus traditional ECKD is not a trivial number. \u0002 Avoid Enterprise Systems Connection (ESCON) CHPIDs: An ESCON CHPID can carry only one I/O at a time.
