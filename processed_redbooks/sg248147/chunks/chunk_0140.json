For z/VM members that are running as a second-level z/VM system, they must not be waiting for CPU more than 10% of the time. For more information, see the \u201cResource Limit Conditions\u201d section of Chapter 27 of IBM z/VM CP Planning and Administration, SC24-6178. \u0002 Paging and other system resources: To prepare for LGR, the target system must have enough system resources during and after the relocation. You must ensure that your paging space is adequate. z/VM 7.2 changed the capabilities and effects of the CP SET RESERVED command and you must consider new information during your planning. \u0002 To be safe, you need twice as much available space as the total virtual memory that can be defined on the system. The easiest way to check this aspect of system resources is to issue the CP QUERY ALLOC PAGE command, which shows the percent that is used, the slots that are available,",
