Conceptual overview 29 1.6 Single system image design With the introduction of z/VM 6.2 in December 2011, the architecture of Linux solutions on this platform changed dramatically. It is true that Cross Systems Extensions (CSE) allowed for a type of clustering environment for Linux on z before z/VM 6.2. However, CSE was not widely used nor was the architecture completely enabled for clusters. z/VM 6.2 introduced VMSSI with LGR and brought about major changes. No longer is it true that a z/VM system is the most important \u201cobject\u201d in the hierarchy. With z/VM 6.1 and earlier, the system identifier of each z/VM system was the most important. With z/VM 6.2 and later, the VMSSI name is the highest level identifier. A block diagram of a four member VMSSI, with default volume labels, is shown in Figure 1-2. The recommend scenario for full",
