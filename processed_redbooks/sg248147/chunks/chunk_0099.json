  "content": "servers to be relocated from one z/VM system to another within the same VMSSI cluster. The VMSSI feature provides this mobility through what is called live guest relocation (LGR). You might need to relocate a running VM for several reasons, for example, workload rebalancing, software configuration management, or hardware maintenance. Before you relocate a guest, you must understand the architectural, disk, memory, and networking requirements. Within this book, hints are provided to help with the installation of the VMSSI feature, and tips are provided to relocate a Linux guest. Note: Multics, which inspired UNIX, shares a common background with the z/VM Conversational Monitor System and some components of the CP. Note: For clarity and consistency, virtual server is the preferred term that is used in this book wherever possible to refer to a Linux VM or server. For more information, a description of VM types, and the USER and IDENTITY statements, see z/VM Getting Started with Linux on",
