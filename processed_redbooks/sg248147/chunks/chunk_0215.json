A strong security configuration at the hypervisor layer allows for full protection of resources across the environment, reduced management overhead from a reduction in hypervisor instances, and improved resource allocation. Chapter 3. Security considerations 73 3.2.2 z/VM built-in security The z/VM Control Program (CP) provides a basic level of security. CP enforces the definitions that are specified in the system directory for resources, such as minidisks. However, the default security includes the following weaknesses: \u0002 The source for the directory is stored on a CMS minidisk and contains passwords (for users and minidisks) that are stored in clear text \u0002 The default location of the directory source file is somewhat well-known, which leads to the possibility of the passwords becoming known \u0002 Poor granularity of resource management control \u0002 No delegation",
