For migrating a RACF database, see the Program Directory for RACF Security Server for z/VM. To configure RACF on a new z/VM 7.2 system, complete the following steps. The first five steps are performed before RACF is started. Steps 6 and 7 put RACF into production: 1. Creating the RACF RPIDIRCT command file. 2. Customizing SMF. 3. Copying the RACF databases. 4.
