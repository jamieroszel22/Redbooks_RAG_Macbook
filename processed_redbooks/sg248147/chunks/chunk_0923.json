  "content": "bottom of the display that the status of RDBKZVMC is Inactive as a result of being disconnected from the group. We can also see that at the time the disconnection of RDBKZVMC occurred, RDBKZVMF performed a load balance of the LACP protocol. Also, the MAC addresses in the ACTOR fields did not change, even though RDBKZVMC is no longer attached to the VSwitch. Instead of changing the MAC addresses, which is disruptive to LACP, the new controlling system (in this case RDBKZVMF) takes over the MAC addresses of RDBKZVMC\u2019s VSwitch to allow LACP to continue. This process happens internally in the port group because the MAC addresses do not appear in a QUERY VSWITCH DETAILS listing. 14.3.4 Link Aggregation Control Protocol When setting up VSwitch Link Aggregation, it is highly recommended that the network switch definition is set up for Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) operation. As defined in IEEE 802.1AX (formerly 802.3ad), LACP is the default operating mode of a z/VM port group.",
