The use of IBMVM1 for anything other than a modeling template represents a significant security exposure for the following reasons: \u0002 The password for IBMVM1 is treated as another shared ID password (for example, as the MAINT password was treated in the past) \u0002 Through surrogate logon, IBMVM1 gives access to many IDs on the system. Therefore, a poorly-secured IBMVM1 password can give access to almost every administration ID that is on a z/VM system. After your local system administrator IDs are defined and thoroughly tested to ensure that they function as expected, we recommend that the IBMVM1 ID is disabled by setting the password to NOLOG, as described",
