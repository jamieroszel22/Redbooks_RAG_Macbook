RHOCP provides powerful orchestration capabilities for the container workload that you are deploying. For orchestration to occur seamlessly, it is essential to provide sufficient resources to your cluster. Chapter 4. Optional extra features of z/VM 87 For a production environment, it is highly recommended to provide at least the preferred or recommended hardware and system requirements that are shown in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-2 Production like RHOCP Cluster in z/VM (hypervisor) environment Minimum requirements The following minimum requirements must be met: \u0002 Hardware: \u2013 Three LPARs with six IFLs each that support SMT2 \u2013 OSA or RoCE network adapters in HA configuration \u2013 HiperSockets, which are attached to a node \u2013 In a z/VM environment, the HiperSockets network can use the z/VM VSWITCH bridge to enable the communication to a z/VM",
