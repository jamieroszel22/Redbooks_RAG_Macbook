Check the devices on your system with the lsdasd command. 2. The pvcreate command initializes partitions for use by LVM. Initialize the two new DASD partitions: # pvcreate /dev/dasde1 /dev/dasdf1 Physical volume \"/dev/dasde1\" successfully created Physical volume \"/dev/dasdf1\" successfully created 3. Verify that the physical volumes were created with the pvdisplay command: # pvdisplay /dev/dasde1 /dev/dasdf1 \"/dev/dasde1\" is a new physical volume of \"3.44 GiB\" --- NEW Physical volume --- PV Name /dev/dasde1 VG Name PV Size 3.44 GiB Allocatable NO PE Size 0 Total PE 0 Free PE 0 Allocated PE 0 PV UUID s0ugfl-hlV3-fYnf-1adW-4mOI-4HTJ-HdA0TU \"/dev/dasdf1\" is a new physical volume of \"3.44 GiB\" --- NEW Physical volume --- PV Name /dev/dasdf1 Volume Group - homevg Physical Extent (PE) Physical Extent (PE) Physical",
