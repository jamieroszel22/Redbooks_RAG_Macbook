Disk storage administration 411 13.4 Moving a physical volume In addition to file systems that grow larger, you might need to move data off one or more volumes on to another or a target set of volumes. If your data is in LVM, the pvmove and vgreduce commands were designed for this process, and they can be used with the file system online. In this example, two physical volumes, /dev/dasde1 and /dev/dasdf1, exist. Data is populated on the first volume, and later moved to the second volume. This movement is performed while the file system is online. To complete this test, perform the following steps: 1. Create a volume group from the first logical volume. In this example, it is named homelv: # vgcreate homevg /dev/dasde1 Volume group \"homevg\" successfully created 2. Observe the number of physical extents: # vgdisplay homevg | grep \"Total PE\" Total PE 1760 3. Create a logical volume from the volume",
