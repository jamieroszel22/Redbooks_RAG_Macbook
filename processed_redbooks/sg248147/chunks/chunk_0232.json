  "content": "unencrypted TN3270 can be easily decoded. We used the popular Wireshark tool to trace traffic during a log on to a non-TLS z/VM system, and can easily locate the user ID and password in the stream. 3.5.2 Enabling TLS for z/VM TN3270 server In this section, we provide an example of how to configure TLS to protect TN3270 communications with z/VM. For this example, we demonstrate how the Ansible system management tool and its OpenSSL modules (running on Linux) can be used to create and manage certificates that secure z/VM communication. Ansible provides the following modules that use OpenSSL to create and manage certificates: openssl_privatekey This module is used to create a private key file that can be used in subsequent certificate operations. openssl_csr This module creates Certificate Signing Request (CSR) files, which are sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) to generate a certificate. openssl_certificate This module performs various operations on certificates, including signing",
