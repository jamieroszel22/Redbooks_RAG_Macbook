This output shows that SMAPI is running, LNXADMIN is correctly authorized to call SMAPI, and the Linux interface smaclient is working. 10.6 Adding a z/VM user ID To add a user to z/VM, you must create a directory entry for each new virtual machine. The default method is through a manual process where you update a file that is called USER DIRECT, which is the z/VM system directory. After installing DirMaint, it will be doing the user ID and resource management on z/VM directory. A virtual machine definition is a grouping of directory statements that begin with the term USER or IDENTITY as shown in Example 10-13. For more information, a description of virtual machine types, and the USER and IDENTITY statements, see Chapter 1 of z/VM Getting Started with Linux on System z, SC24-6194. Example 10-13 z/VM",
