Figure 4-1 IBM Cloud Infrastructure Center Architecture on z/VM Consider the following points regarding the architecture that is shown in Figure 4-1: \u0002 For one cloud, only one management node must be set up that manages all of the compute nodes. \u0002 For each to-be-managed z/VM, one compute node is required. \u0002 The management node can be installed at the same z/VM with one of the compute nodes, but they must be on different Linux virtual machines of that z/VM. 4.1.2 Automation By using a library of predefined images, it is possible to quickly change the environment to better fit any situation. The workloads also can be better fit by starting new web servers, or shutting down unused back-end servers. The API can be used to check key metrics from the environment, and not only from the deployed guests. With those interfaces, it is possible to verify resource usage, software versions,",
