Because the traffic requirement of the IVL Network is modest, OSA-Express 1000BaseT or Gigabit Ethernet cards can be used (even if the Global VSwitch uses 10 Gigabit cards). Defining the IVL VSwitch on each system The IVL VSwitch is defined by using the DEFINE VSWITCH command, as with a normal VSwitch, but the type of IVL must be used. Example 14-1 shows the result of creating the IVL VSwitch on the first of our systems.
