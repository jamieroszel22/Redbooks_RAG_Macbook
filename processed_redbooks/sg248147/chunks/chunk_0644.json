If this issue occurs, it is important to not just log off from the ID at the managed system. If service actions were underway on the to-be-managed system, those actions might bring the system to a state that is inconsistent with the maintenance to be managed by using VMCSM. 292 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 We verified that no service activities were occurring on the to-be-managed system; then, retried the command. Example 9-18 shows the result of our successful SERVMGR SYSTEM ADD command. Example 9-18 SERVMGR SYStem ADD command output servmgr system add 720 rdbkzvmc rsu1 nonesm hostname 9.76.61.239 commtype ftp VMFCMG2195I SERVMGR SYSTEM ADD 720",
