However, it is important to ensure that administrator access and other connections to z/VM are protected from accidental or malicious interception. TN3270 is the main access method to a z/VM system. Because it is based on the Telnet protocol, it provides no security by default. Therefore, passwords and other information can be retrieved from an intercepted network session. Such an exposure might occur for entirely innocent reasons. At some point, your organization\u2019s network team might be conducting problem identification on the network. As a result, they might be required to capture network traffic. During that traffic capture, you happen to log on to your z/VM system, so your z/VM login details are captured.
