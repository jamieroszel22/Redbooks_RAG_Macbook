HCPSWU3165I Device 1910.P00 for VSWITCH VSWGLBL is now the Active LAG Port Contr oller for shared port group GRPGLBL. HCPSWU2830I DTCVSW3 is VSWITCH controller for device 1910.P00. HCPSWU2855I Device 1910.P00 for VSWITCH VSWGLBL is enabled for port group GRPGLB L by LACP. Over the course of a few seconds, the LACP negotiation starts with the network switch over the first port in the port group. This process is indicated by the first pair of HCPSWU2830I and HCPSWU2855I messages, followed by HCPSWU3165I when the LACP negotiation completes. Later (in our case it was about 20 - 30 seconds) the second port in the group is added and the second pair of HCPSWU2830I and HCPSWU2855I messages appears. We performed a display of the new VSwitch by using QUERY VSWITCH DETAILS. Example 14-9 shows the output of this command. Example 14-9 QUERY VSWITCH DETAILS on the Global VSwitch q vswitch vswglbl details",
