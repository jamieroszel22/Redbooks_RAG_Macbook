Using BTRFS for /home, /opt, /srv, /usr, or /var quickly becomes a severe performance bottleneck that often results in a system failure to adequately process workload. 48 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 2.5 HiperDispatch planning In z/VM 6.3, IBM introduced new virtual server dispatching technology into z/VM this is called HiperDispatch. The z/VM HiperDispatch enhancement is meant to help the workload realize good performance from the CPC\u2019s memory subsystem, especially from its caches. To achieve this performance, z/VM HiperDispatch runs the partition in vertical mode, dispatches virtual servers in a topologically aware way, and uses logical CPUs in accordance with the availability of physical CPU power. Workloads that are likely to benefit from z/VM HiperDispatch are those workloads for which cache performance is likely to",
