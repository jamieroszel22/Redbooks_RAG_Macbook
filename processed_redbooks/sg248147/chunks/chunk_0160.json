  "content": "However, the z/VM and Linux community agrees that one or two small swap spaces on a VDisk that also can be backed up by a larger swap space on real disk are best. Real-world experience from IBM ATS and Lab Services teams that work with customers indicates that correctly sized Linux guests seldom, if ever, swaps. This book describes how to set up two VDisk swap spaces, but not the additional physical disk because it is seldom required. To create the swap spaces, the SWAPGEN EXEC created by Sine Nomine Associates, Inc. is used. It creates and formats a Linux swap disk from Conversational Monitor System (CMS). For more information about the current version, and instructions for downloading and installing SWAPGEN are in the swapgen-readme.txt file that is available on this Sine Nomine web page. Important: Never use BTRFS for application or work data. Although the subvolume and snapshotting features that are included with BTRFS are excellent for recovery of accidental changes or mistakes",
