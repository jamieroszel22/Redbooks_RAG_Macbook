You also can see all of the standard VMSES/E aliases, such as APPLY, DELTA, LOCALMOD, and BUILDx. This result shows part of how VMCSM works: it creates an \u201cimage\u201d of what an installed system looks like within directories in VMPSFS, and then applies service to that image in the same way that service is applied to a live system. However, before the service level can be used for a system, we also must include the VMCSM PTF to the service level by using following command: servmgr srvlvl service 720 rsu1 all vmcsm Chapter 9. z/VM Centralized Service Management 289 We found that the PTF did not complete in a single run and required a restart (just as it did on the live systems).
