Figure 1-2 A four-member VMSSI cluster architectural diagram 30 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 Four z/VM systems and four system identifiers are in this cluster. However, only one VMSSI name is in this cluster. In this book, a two member VMSSI that is installed onto one CPC is described, as shown in Figure 1-3. Figure 1-3 The z/VM environment used in this book 1.7 Infrastructure design To install and configure z/VM, and to install, configure, and provision virtual servers, a specific infrastructure design must be in place. A CPC with associated resources and the z/VM operating system define much of this infrastructure. z/VM includes many predefined virtual servers. The VMs that are described in this book have the following functions: LNXMAINT A VM that is used to own and manage the Shared File System (SFS) file pool to be used by Linux virtual servers.",
