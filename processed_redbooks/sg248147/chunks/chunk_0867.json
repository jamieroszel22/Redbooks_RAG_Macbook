Ensure that the multipath-tools RPM is installed with the following zypper command: # zypper in multipath-tools b. Run the multipath daemon: # systemctl enable multipathd # systemctl start multipathd c. Create a partition on the disk by using the parted command: # parted -s /dev/mapper/mpatha mklabel msdos mkpart primary 0% 100% d. Use YaST to set up the partitioning for the multipath device. In this case, the FCP disk will become a LUN in a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) group for the /srv/ directory: Run yast -> System -> Partitioner. Click Yes if you are asked if you really want to use this tool. Select System View -> Hard Disks and press [+]. There is a new device available that represents the multipathed FCP disks. Add a partition that covers the full disk. Use Raw Volume and Do not format partition and Do not mount partition.",
