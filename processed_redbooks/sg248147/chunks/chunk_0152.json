  "content": "IBM z/VM 7.2 DASD versus SCSI-FCP This book describes how to use conventional ECKD DASD and to access SCSI-FCP and emulated DASD (EDEV) disks. SCSI/FCP disks require worldwide port name/logical unit number (WWPN/LUN) identifiers and the correct zoning setup. Frequently, a combination of these types of disk storage is used. When a combination is used, the ECKD or EDEV DASD are often used for the root file system and SCSI/FCP disks are used for large data storage areas. 3390-09s, or larger Emulated 3390-09s format to approximately 6.8 GB, about three times larger are 3390-27s (20.1 GB), and 3390-54s format to about 42.1 GB. z/VM 7.2 can be installed on to 3390-09s or larger. However, for the z/VM system volumes that are used for version, residence, release, and so forth, we recommend the use of 3390-09. For PAGE and SPOOL areas, DASDs larger than 3390-09 can be used; however, all of the involved page and spool disks must be of identical size and not serve mixed purposes. If you have",
