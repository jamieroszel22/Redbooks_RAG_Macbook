  "content": "configure either of the physical ports. \u0002 All OSA ports can be reused if they are shared over different LPARs. \u0002 The OSA ports within an LPAR can be used only once, which also holds true for z/VM configurations, such as Port Groups. \u0002 Linux does not use PORTNAMES. They can be omitted or set as an empty string. \u0002 If the separation between several ports of an OSA is important, do not use direct-attached OSA devices. 2.9.4 Maximum transmission unit size matters In this section, we describe sizing the maximum transmission unit (MTU). An MTU is the size of the largest single unit of information transmitted along a network. Sizing the MTU correctly can improve bulk protocol throughput. MTU sizes for QDIO Open Systems Adapters MTU sizing is different from traditional distributed systems. Set MTUs to the maximum size that is supported by all hops on the path to the final destination to avoid fragmentation. A simplified way to help determine the correct MTU size to use is to run tracepath",
