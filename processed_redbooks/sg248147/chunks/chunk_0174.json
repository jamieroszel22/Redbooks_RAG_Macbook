  "content": "book means that the Linux administrator can access all z/VM passwords, unless RACF/VM or another external security manager (ESM) is in place to provide password encryption. As described in 1.5, \u201cChoices and decisions for this book\u201d on page 27, the use of an ESM must not be seen as optional. H 10% of real storage that is defined for the LPAR to allow for system-owned virtual pages. I minimum Add E + G + H to obtain I, which is your bare minimum paging space amount. When you calculate this value, you determine the bare minimum paging space amount that is ordinarily considered safe. J recommended Multiply I by a reserve margin value to obtain J, which is the final value you use. Reserve is added because your calculation might be uncertain and your system grows over time. Multiply your value that is calculated for I by a reserve safety margin to help to protect yourself against abends that are caused by paging space filling up. IBM offers no rule for the reserve safety factor multiplier",
