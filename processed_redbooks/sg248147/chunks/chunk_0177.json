On IBM Z or LinuxONE systems, different networking methods are available, which are provided by the I/O subsystem that controls the LPARs, such as IBM PR/SM (possibly with IBM Dynamic Partition Manager [DPM]), or the z/VM hypervisor. Several other networking methods are available that are not described in this book because they are impractical, complex, or limited. The virtual Open Systems Adapter (OSA) and Virtual Switch (VSWITCH) TCP/IP devices that are used in z/VM are equivalent to high-end enterprise class networking devices. You need at least a fundamental understanding of TCP/IP networking, routing, and switching to plan your network configuration more easily. If you have a new installation, we recommend that you use one of the options that are described in this section. 2.9.1 Involvement of stakeholders For the scope of this book,",
