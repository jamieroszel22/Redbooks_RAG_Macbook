In this case, z/VM can use HyperPAV on behalf of a non-exploiting virtual machine when several virtual machines share the full-pack minidisk by using multiple LINKs. \u0002 HyperPAV minidisks with operating system exploitation An exploiting operating system in a virtual machine can control HyperPAV features. This operating system understands how to control and use virtual HyperPAV aliases. Base devices must be defined as full-pack minidisks to the virtual machine. Virtual alias devices are then defined by using the DEFINE HYPERPAVALIAS command. Configuring z/VM to use HyperPAV Example 11-7 shows how to define HyperPAV to a Linux operating system that uses dedicated DASD. The example dedicates a DASD at virtual device 100 and adds two HyperPAV alias devices from the pool of available HyperPAV alias devices. Example 11-7 Directory entry for using HyperPAV with dedicated DASD ===> dirmaint foruser linux2 dedicate 01FE",
