  "content": "the VSWITCH. No definition is needed on the VSWITCH. To attach the guests to the interconnect VLAN, they must have more virtual NICs defined. The extra NIC must have the VLAN keyword added, which specifies the VLAN ID of the interconnect VLAN. For example, the following example shows two NICs on a guest, one for normal network traffic and one for interconnect: NICDEF 600 TYPE QDIO LAN SYSTEM MAINVSW NICDEF 620 TYPE QDIO LAN SYSTEM MAINVSW VLAN 120 In this example, the VSWITCH was defined with VLAN DEFAULT 100, which assigns all network interfaces that are not specified with a VLAN ID to VLAN 100. The second interface specifies VLAN 120, which is the interconnect VLAN. 418 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 14.2 Creating a HiperSockets device between logical partitions IBM HiperSockets devices can be used within a CEC to enable fast and secure connectivity between a Linux server and z/OS.
