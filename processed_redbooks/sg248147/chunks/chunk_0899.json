Working with networks 423 14.3.2 Multiple VSWITCH Link Aggregation As you can see from the previous example, exclusive-mode link aggregation does not scale over many z/VM systems. The Global VSwitch capability relieved this limitation by allowing link aggregation OSA ports to be shared between z/VM LPARs. To allow exclusive-mode link aggregation to scale over many z/VM systems, an IVL Domain is a group of up to 16 z/VM systems that can share link aggregation ports. Connectivity for IVL Domains is implemented over an Ethernet-based IVL Network, which is defined by using IVL VSwitches and OSA ports. Up to 16 z/VM systems can be part of an IVL Domain, and an IVL Network can support many IVL Domains. Up to eight Domains are supported without the use of VLANs on the IVL Network; up to eight Domains per IVL VLAN are supported with VLANs on the IVL Network). The ports used for the IVL Network must be separate from the link",
