  "content": "all 3390-54s (as we did for this book), all of the paging volumes must then be 3390-54s. This rule applies to whatever type of volumes you ultimately choose. When the volumes are unequally sized, any smaller volumes fill up and become ineligible as targets for future page-outs. This situation results in an unnecessary bottleneck that negatively affects system performance by restricting the z/VM opportunity for paging I/O concurrency. \u0002 Use HyperPAV paging or spread out if not: If you are planning to deploy workloads that are frequently paged, ensure your paging strategy is up to par. If your paging volumes are HyperPAV capable, ensure they have sufficient HPAV Aliases associated. For a 3390-54, a minimum of eight aliases is recommended. If you are not using HyperPAV-capable DASD, it is imperative that you instead spread your paging space over as many smaller volumes as possible. Get many little paging volumes instead of one or two large paging volumes. The more paging volumes that you",
