Pass phrases (as implemented in RACF) support up to 100 characters from a wider character set. The use of pass phrases instead of passwords is an important consideration that allows z/VM to integrate into a wider enterprise security environment. Note: In the past, some ESMs (including RACF) did not use strong encryption methods to protect passwords; instead, they used \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d. RACF now provides the KDFAES password encryption method, which uses much stronger encryption (backed by the hardware CPACF) to protect passwords and pass phrases. Enabling KDFAES also avoids a previous RACF restriction around pass phrase length. Pass phrases 9 - 13 characters were not supported in RACF without writing an exit to allow them. This restriction is removed when KDFAES is enabled, and pass phrases 9 - 100 characters are",
