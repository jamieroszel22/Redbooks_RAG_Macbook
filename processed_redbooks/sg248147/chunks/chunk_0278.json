All of the files and utilities that are used throughout this book are ready to be downloaded to your z/VM system, as described in 6.7, \u201cEnabling and configuring RACF\u201d. Note: In the past, z/VM came with two compressed files. The first file contained the GA level of z/VM and the second file contained the first Recommended Service Upgrade (RSU). z/VM V7R2 is only one compressed file that contains the GA installation code and RSU together. Further, the RSU is now applied automatically during installation. After z/VM is installed, it is strongly recommended that you check the RSU level of the installed system and compare it to the latest available RSU as extra service (updates and fixes) might need to be applied. Note: Previously, this book used an example value of /ftp/zvm/sg248147/",
