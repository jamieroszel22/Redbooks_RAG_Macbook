  "content": "method is simple to implement by using REXX. 2.11.5 Command retrieve convention The ability to retrieve past commands is a common tool. Often, it is helpful to retrieve in both directions if you overlook the command for which you are looking. The default Linux shell, bash, performs this task by default by using the up arrow and down arrow keys. A convention in z/VM is to use the F12 function key (labeled PF12 on physical 3270 devices) to retrieve the last command, although it is not defined to all VMs. No convention exists to retrieve commands in the other direction, but it is possible to set another key to that function. Therefore, the F11 key is used to retrieve forward because it is next to the F12 key. Also, the same function is useful in the editor, XEDIT. The ? subcommand retrieves past commands,; therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to F12. For more information about implementing this concept, see \u201cPROFILE EXEC for Linux virtual machines\u201d on page 497. 62",
