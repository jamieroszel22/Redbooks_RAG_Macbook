  "content": "depending on which type of disks the cluster was installed onto. One spool volume for each member is probably adequate for Linux needs. However, more paging volumes are recommended, especially if you plan to use the z/VM memory overcommitment feature for your Linux virtual machines. Although certain volumes are shared, the page and temporary disk volumes are not. If you used 3390-9, it is recommended that you add at least one additional 3390-9 paging volume so that you will have a total of two. If you used 3390-3, add at least four additional 3390-3 paging volumes for a total of five. Adequate paging space will give you room to add more Linux virtual machines. Guidelines for planning paging were covered in 2.7, \u201cPaging\u201d on page 50. 6.11.1 Formatting volumes for page space Before you add paging volumes to the SSI cluster members, you must format the DASD volumes to be used for minidisk space (PERM) and paging space (PAGE). Normally, you format the DASD volumes one at a time by using",
