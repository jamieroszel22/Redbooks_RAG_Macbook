  "content": "the CKD DASD. \u0002 Compared to direct-attached Fibre Channel, the performance is limited. \u0002 EDEV disks are configured as emulated 9336 Model 20. The maximum disk size for CMS disks is 45 GB. The maximum size for FBA disks is 381 GB. \u0002 IBM suggests that clients that are defining disks for use by CMS need to set a practical limit of about 22 GB. Configuring z/VM to use emulated DASD Perform the persistent configuration of EDEV in System Configuration (SYSTEM CONFIG). The following example shows how to configure one EDEV with the following components: \u0002 NPIV adapters B800 and B900 \u0002 DS8000 I/O ports that are reachable from B800 with WWPNs: \u2013 500507630500C74C \u2013 50050763050BC74C \u0002 DS8000 I/O ports that are reachable from B900 with WWPNs: \u2013 50050763051BC74C \u2013 500507630510C74C \u0002 The LUN number is 4010401100000000. \u0002 The rdev of the EDEV is 3000. \u0002 You are using a DS8000 Model 2107. \u0002 The EDEV is on the SSI with the nodes ITSOZVM1 and ITSOZVM2.
