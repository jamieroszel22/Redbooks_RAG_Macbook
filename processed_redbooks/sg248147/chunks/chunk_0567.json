  "content": "system resources. Link and resource contention might negatively affect performance and therefore increase quiesce time during relocation. Therefore, it is recommended that only one relocation is performed at a time. If a set of relocations is to be initiated from a single script or EXEC, you can use the SYNC option (the default) on the VMRELOCATE command. 7.2 Relocate a Linux system You can use the VMRELOCATE command to move a Linux system from the SSI member on which it is running to another member in the cluster. To accomplish this task, perform the following steps: 1. Log on as MAINT on the member where the Linux system is running. In this example, the Linux system LINUX1 is running on member 1, ITSOZVM1. 2. Choose a sample Linux system to relocate and verify that it is running on the member. In this example, the target is LINUX1: ===> q LINUX1 LINUX1 - DSC The output shows that LINUX1 as disconnected, which means that it is running on this member. Note: The maximum memory size",
