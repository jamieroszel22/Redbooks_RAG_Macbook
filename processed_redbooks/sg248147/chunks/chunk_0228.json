Multifactor authentication (MFA) enhances standard security by providing an alternative log on flow that can use multiple authentication factors. The IBM Z Multifactor Authentication V2.1 product (5655-MA1) supports z/VM and z/OS (although a separate installation of the MFA server is needed for z/VM and z/OS systems). The extra factors can be various out-of-band techniques, including RSA SecurID, LDAP, Radius, and one-time password (OTP) systems, such as Google Authenticator. An example MFA log in to CMS might resemble the following process: 1. Access the MFA server by using a web browser. 2.
