  "content": "configuration is performed from the HMC. It eliminates the need to build a stand-alone IOCP input deck for I/O devices. It also eliminates the need for the second power-on reset (POR) to enable dynamic I/O, which is required in non-DPM configurations. DPM provides for fully dynamic reconfiguration of CPU, memory, and I/O resources. Adding and dynamically reconfiguring I/O devices is greatly simplified with DPM. Simplified vision of DPM DPM provides the following advantages: \u0002 Fast. Much faster than managing with HCD and HCM. From hours to minutes. \u0002 Easy. Intuitive user interface. No need for multiple administrators with different skills or tools. Do not expect First In Enterprise Linux customers to adopt the previous way. \u0002 Powerful. The same efficient PR/SM hardware virtualization without the complexity. It supports dynamic configuration changes with a few mouse clicks. It also provides a foundation for \u201cbare metal\u201d cloud. 2.2 Choosing a z/VM installation method As you proceed",
