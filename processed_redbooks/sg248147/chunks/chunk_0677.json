If you are in z/VM SSI cluster, you need to log on member1. 7. Log on to the next member in the SSI cluster as MAINT720 and put DirMaint into production on that node by issuing the PUT2PROD DIRM command. Repeat this action for each SSI member in the cluster. DirMaint is now enabled across all members of the SSI cluster. Important: If VMLINK returns HCPLNM103E DASD 051D forced R/O, another user has the link as R/W and must change its access to R/O. Do not use MW mode for any MDisk at all, you can destroy the MDisk content. Tip: You can also perform this step in only one command instead of three commands. Note that the parenthesis part of the command and must be included: ===> vmlink pmaint cf0 (invoke type system config z 310 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 10.2 Tailoring DirMaint This section describes the DirMaint tailoring in an SSI cluster",
