  "content": "Query the time when a virtual image was activated. Consider the following points when SMAPI is used: \u0002 VSMGUARD must always be used to start SMAPI, regardless of whether the system is running in a Unified Resource Manager environment. \u0002 A Directory Manager license is not required. If a Directory Manager is not purchased and installed, a \"SMAPI USE ONLY\" instance of DirMaint is installed and configured. \u0002 A Performance Toolkit license is not required. SMAPI installs and configures a \"SMAPI USE ONLY\" instance of the Performance Toolkit to obtain performance data for use in provided SMAPI APIs. 10.5.1 Who needs SMAPI SMAPI is ideal for the following user types: \u0002 Cloud solutions, such as IBM Cloud Infrastructure Center, IBM Wave, and IBM Cloud Connector \u0002 Any Business Partner or customer who wants to provide alternative methods or access to z/VM SMAPI functions \u0002 Primarily for those that are running a IBM Z, but without IBM Z z/VM skills, which mostly are customers that are running Linux",
