This result shows that although the Global VSwitch functions like a logical single VSwitch that is present in both systems, it is two separate VSwitches that share the global port group. For this reason, the VSwitch must be defined on each system, while the port group did not need to be defined. \u0002 Now that the Global VSwtich is defined on our second system, RDBKZVMF now appears as Synchronized at the end of the QUERY VSWITCH DETAILS output. For completeness, we repeated the Q PORT GROUP DETAILS display on RDBKZVMF to compare the output (see Example 14-13). Example 14-13 QUERY",
