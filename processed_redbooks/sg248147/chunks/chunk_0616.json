  "content": "The configuration file for the VMCSM FTP server is supplied as a sample, which must be copied. The sample is CSMSERVE SCONFIG, on TCPMAINT 591, and it must be copied to CSMSERVE CONFIG on TCPMAINT 198. If needed, modify CSMSERVE CONFIG to include parameters that are required for your site (such as encryption). If changes are made to CSMSERVE CONFIG, it is recommended not to change the KEEPALIVE and INACTIVE statements. These settings were made to support the operation of VMCSM, and are changed only after consulting with IBM Support Center. FTP DATA update on principal system The default value of DataCtTime must be changed on the system that is the VMCSM principal system. Copy the IBM supplied FTP SDATA file from TCPMAINT 592 to MAINTCSM 191 as FTP DATA. Then, in the copied file, set the DataCtTime value to 720 seconds: DataCtTime 720 For each software release that is maintained by VMCSM, this file must be copied to the CSM root directory for that release.
