This section describes several standardized conventions. 2.11.1 DASD volume labeling convention You must adopt a standardized convention for labeling DASD. If one or more IBM Z or LinuxONE systems exist, your IT department might use a labeling standard that determines the labels to be given to the DASD that is used by your z/VM LPARs. Each DASD includes a real device address that consists of four hexadecimal digits, and each DASD has a six character label. When assigning DASD labels, include the four-digit address in the label so that you can easily tell the address of each DASD from its label. As your workload expands and you begin to work on disk administration tasks, this information proves to be invaluable because it saves time. When followed thoroughly, this naming convention ensures that no two DASDs have the same label, which can be important, especially when an IBM z/OS LPAR can access the DASD. Sometimes, DASD is shared",
