For example, if you want a shared /home/ directory, it must be a sufficient size for many users to write data to. You can use the LVM to combine multiple DASD volumes into one logical volume. This example does not create a large logical volume, but it shows all of the necessary steps. The following sections describe a logical volume with additional DASD on a Linux guest. Use the following overall steps in adding a logical volume. 13.2.1 Creating a logical volume and file system The following overall steps are involved in creating a logical volume: 1.
