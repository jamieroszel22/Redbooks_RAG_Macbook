However, the use of conventional 3390 DASD is still considered to be the fastest and simplest choice. \u0002 To avoid unnecessary risk, the authors chose not to cover cloning. As an alternative to cloning, automated installation or imaging is now considered the preferred practice and is covered in this publication. Attention: It is bad practice to run a z/VM system without an ESM in place to correctly encrypt passwords and ensure sufficient controls on commands and system functions. It is widely regarded as good practice for any non-production systems (such as those systems for development and testing) to be administered to a production-level standard. As such, z/VM always must be configured to use an ESM, regardless of any functional readiness or status labels. Important: The practice of cloning is no longer considered a good practice and is deprecated. Changes in modern",
