For maximum throughput, when you are setting up your network, follow the section, \u201cGuidelines for planning your network in an SSI cluster\u201d, in Chapter 2 of z/VM Getting Started with Linux on System z, SC24-6194. Faster CTC speeds increase throughput and result in shorter relocations. \u0002 As a preferred practice, define the same real device numbers to reference the same devices on all members of the VMSSI cluster. Discuss this practice with your hardware administrator to ensure that this naming is reflected by the I/O configuration data set (IOCDS). Chapter 2. Planning 39 Factors that can affect relocation, system performance, or both Consider the following factors in planning for Linux LGR: \u0002 VM memory: The size and use of the VM\u2019s memory can affect relocation performance. Parts of the processing for relocation are proportional to the size of",
