  "content": "physical I/O avoidance can be high. Avoidance can be as high as 50% in certain cases. However, do not assume that a high HIT RATIO with a low value for the reads rate is good. (A 100% hit ratio with only 1 I/O per second is meaningless.) \u0002 Line 3 describes more storage (memory) management. The PAGING rate is important. Higher values often affect performance. PAGING can be at least partially offset by increasing the number of page volumes, but a more thorough examination of this problem is advisable whenever it arises. \u0002 On lines 4 - 7, you see a series of counters that represent the users in various queues. The z/VM scheduler classifies work into three classes (1 - 3) and a special extra class that is labeled zero. So the column of Qx values and Ex represent the virtual machines in the dispatch list and the eligible list. The most important value to validate is to ensure that no virtual machines are in the Eligible list: E1, E2, or E3, which implies that z/VM stopped dispatching",
