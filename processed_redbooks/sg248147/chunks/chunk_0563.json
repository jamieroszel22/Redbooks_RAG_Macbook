Single-configuration virtual machines are eligible for guest relocation. \u0002 Multi-configuration virtual machine A virtual machine that is defined by the IDENTITY and SUBCONFIG statements can be logged on concurrently to multiple members of the SSI cluster. The virtual machines have common attributes but they can also be configured to access different resources. Multi-configuration virtual machines are not eligible for guest relocation.
