Dynamic SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections are supported by the following z/VM TCP/IP application servers and clients, which are updated to accommodate this support: \u0002 TCP/IP server \u0002 SSL server \u0002 FTP server \u0002 FTP client \u0002 Telnet server (Internal to the TCP/IP server) \u0002 Telnet client \u0002 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server Server certificates and certificate authority (CA) certificates are stored in a certificate (key) database, which is in the z/VM Byte File System (BFS) and managed independently of the SSL server.
