From these real device addresses, determine the channel paths that they are on by using the following commands: \u0002 Display the channel paths that are used by the CTCs on ITSOZVM1: ===> q path to 47e0 Device 47E0, Status ONLINE CHPIDs to Device 4120 (PIM) : 4C ===> q path to 57e0 Device 57E0, Status ONLINE CHPIDs to Device 57E0 (PIM) : 4D \u0002 Display the channel paths that are used by the CTCs on ITSOZVM2: ===> q path to 4120 Device 4120, Status ONLINE CHPIDs to Device 4120 (PIM) : 4C ===> q path to 5120 Device 5120, Status ONLINE CHPIDs to Device 5120 (PIM) : 4D The previous two commands show the channel-path identifiers (CHPIDs) that the CTCs are on. In this example, they are 4C and 4D. From these CHPIDs, determine the other available CTC devices by completing the following steps:",
