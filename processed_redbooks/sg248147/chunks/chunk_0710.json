The z/VM SMAPI is the access point for any external tool to manage the z/VM running on IBMZ platform. It supports management of lifecycle and configuration of various platform resources, such as Guest, CPU, memory, virtual switches, storage, and more. Some IBM products use the SMAPI to perform various tasks on the z/VM system. Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that SMAPI is configured and running before you configure any cloud piece that interacts with z/VM. The exact configuration steps for SMAPI might differ from the following section based on the version and release level of z/VM. z/VM ships a set of servers that provide local system management APIs (see Figure 10-3).
