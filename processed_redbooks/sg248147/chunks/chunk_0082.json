In those days, enormous mainframe systems were beginning to appear at businesses and universities as the world began to adopt computerization on a large scale. Early mainframe systems were not the compact and affordable systems they are today. Because of cost and physical size, it was exceptionally rare for any organization to have more than one. To maximize the utility and return on investment, it became standard practice to provide shared access through physical terminals. Was there a better way? Engineers at IBM\u2019s Glendale development laboratory in Endicott, New York began to ponder this question and prototype methods. In 1971, IBM released a product that is considered the genesis of cloud computing; an operating system called virtual machine (VM). For",
