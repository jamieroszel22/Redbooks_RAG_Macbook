If any of these tests fail, the relocation is terminated. The error message that is displayed indicates the size of the guest with the available capacity on the destination system. If you are certain that these three checks do not apply to your installation (for instance, because you have an overabundance of central memory and a less than recommended amount of paging space), you can choose for CP to skip these three checks by specifying FORCE STORAGE on the VMRELOCATE command. 7.1.4 Minimizing link and resource contention The relocation process monitors system resources and might determine that a relocation needs to be slowed down temporarily to avoid exhausting",
