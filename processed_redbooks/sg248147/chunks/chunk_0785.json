  "content": "connection to the external network. As 10-gigabit Ethernet (10 GiE) becomes more prevalent, the small number of possible use cases for this scenario dwindled even further. An exceptionally small number of cases exist in which a direct-attached OSA is necessary when the VSWITCH uses 10 GiE uplinks. Important: The direct-attached OSA configuration is not a recommended configuration. Use it with extreme caution. It is a single point of failure in an otherwise highly available environment. It can also become packed and stall, which triggers rollbacks or failures in fault-intolerant consumers. The VSWITCH does not exhibit this weakness and remains the recommended method. 362 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 11.3.3 Configuring z/VM to provide direct-attached OSA interfaces The configuration that is needed to provide OSA interfaces to a virtual machine is basically the same as dedicating three suitable OSA device addresses to the virtual machine.
