This feature greatly improves the security of shared IDs because the credential of the shared ID is no longer used to access the ID. Some shared user IDs are provided as part of a z/VM system (including MAINT, MAINTvrm, TCPMAINT, product owning IDs, and service VMs). In addition, Linux guest VMs can be considered shared. Without surrogate logon, the passwords for these users must be recorded in a way that is accessible by those with an authorized need to access them. A secure way of managing this process is to add complexity, which also might affect recovery time in the case of a problem that required the shared ID to resolve. Done insecurely (such as the \u201cpassword-on-the-noticeboard\u201d), the shared ID presents a significant risk to the security and integrity of the",
