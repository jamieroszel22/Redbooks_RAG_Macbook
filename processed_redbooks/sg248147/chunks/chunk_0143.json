  "content": "VMSSI cluster, it is increasingly important to identify the level of Linux on IBM Z that is running within each member. The latest level of a distribution release is considered to be the supported level by the Linux Distribution Partners. The preferred practice for setting up VMSSI is to ensure that you are running on the latest level and that your distribution is supported by your Linux distributor. Why ECKD DASD is required If z/VM 7.2 is installed into a VMSSI, at least one extended count key data (ECKD) volume is necessary for the Persistent Data Record (PDR). If you plan to implement RACF, the database must be configured as being shared and at least two ECKD DASD volumes are necessary. Concurrent virtual and real reserve/release must always be used for the RACF database DASD when RACF is installed in A VMSSI. For more information about sharing a RACF database, see z/VM RACF Security Server System Programmer\u2019s Guide, SC24-6212. For information about DASD sharing, see IBM z/VM CP",
