When IBM delivers the system, the PUs are characterized as different types based on the workloads they process. For IBM Z, these PUs can be General Processors (GP or CP), Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL), Integrated Coupling Facility (ICF) for IBM Parallel Sysplex\u00ae configurations, and so on. For LinuxONE, the system is equipped with only Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) processing units. \u0002 Logical partitions From the perspective of system use and management, LPARs are equivalent to separate physical systems. Each LPAR has its own operating system, which can be any mainframe operating system. LPARs optionally also can be configured to share I/O devices, but this decision is a local decision that is made during hardware planning. Important: You might hear some system programmers use the antiquated term central electronic complex, which is abbreviated as CEC and sometimes even pronounced \u201ck\u2018ehk\u201d (as if",
