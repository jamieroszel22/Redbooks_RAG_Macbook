Regardless of which method you choose, remember that IFLs are never assigned to an PR/SM LPAR or DPM partition. Rather, the weights are set to move the entitlements to the LPARs or partitions that are deemed to be higher priority. For more information, see \u201cz/VM configuration and performance information from Dr. Brian Wade:\u201d on page 476. 2.1.1 Processor Resource/Systems Manager Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM) enables logical partitioning of the central processor complex (CPC) in IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE servers. Each LPAR runs its own operating system, such as z/VM, and include resources that are dedicated or shared among multiple LPARs. It allows the definition and control of the logical partitions and their resources, including the following examples: \u0002 Processors \u0002 Memory \u0002 Channel",
