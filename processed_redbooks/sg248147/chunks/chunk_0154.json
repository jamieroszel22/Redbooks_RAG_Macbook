In addition, overhead exists that is associated with the translation that must occur, which results in CPU consumption. However, depending on your workload, it is possible that either one of these factors can be a negligible or trivial amount. \u0002 It is recommended to use dedicated FCP subchannels for Linux virtual servers unless a requirement exists for any one or more of the benefits of sharing, deployment, and maintenance simplification, and minidisk caching that come with z/VM minidisk usage. Chapter 2. Planning 45 \u0002 Use traditional ECKD DASD for paging and spooling, except when little paging or spooling activity exists, or sufficient processor resources are available to",
