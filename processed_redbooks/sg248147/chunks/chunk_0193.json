This idea can be thought of as installing a tall fence around a parcel of land you own so that a clear boundary exists. Configuring the IODEF in this manner helps eliminate risk. Configure your IODEF in a way that all LPARs can see. Note: Previous iterations of this book recommended the use of 0600 as the default virtual device number for a virtual network adapter. We recommend against this default because it can become confusing. 60 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 \u2192 Device: 0AD0 Unit: 000 Role:",
