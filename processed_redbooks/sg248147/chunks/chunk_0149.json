  "content": "assigning a Locally Administered address range to use with your SSI cluster: \u2013 The address range must be unique. Ideally, it must be unique across your entire enterprise. If not possible, at a minimum it must be unique within the LAN segment to which your OSA cards are cabled. If you are deploying your new z/VM infrastructure onto a network segment that shares a Server Access or Server Distribution switch with any existing production systems, it is important that you ensure the uniqueness of your MAC address range. If it is not unique, severe negative consequences can occur to the other network-attached devices or systems. Chapter 2. Planning 43 \u2013 Each MAC address consists of a 12-digit hexadecimal number, which must begin with 02 as the first octet; for example: \u201c020C46005501\u201d. \u2013 Do not assign \u201c0000 0000 0000\u201d or \u201cFFFF FFFF FFFF.\u201d \u2013 The range is 0200 0000 0000 - 02FF FFFF FFFF. The MAC address range must be unique within the LAN segment to which you connect. For more information, see",
