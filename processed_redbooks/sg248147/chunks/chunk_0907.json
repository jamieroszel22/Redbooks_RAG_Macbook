When running the QUERY PORT GROUP command without parameters, we saw the response No active groups found. This message is expected because the port group does not become active until it is connected to a VSwitch. Displaying inactive port groups can be done by using the ALL INActive parameter on the QUERY PORT GROUP command, or by displaying the group by name. We used the display-by-name method to show the group. As shown in Example 14-7, we saw that the group was defined on the second system automatically through the IVL. Example 14-7 QUERY PORT GROUP command q port group grpglbl Group: GRPGLBL.0 Inactive LACP Mode: Active Shared VSWITCH <none> ifIndex: 2112 Load Balancing: Collaborative Interval: 300 RDEV: 1930.P00 Adapter ID: 3907000BB4B7.010C RDEV: 1910.P00",
