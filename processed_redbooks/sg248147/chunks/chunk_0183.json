  "content": "destination from a Linux system on the same network segment that your OSAs use. It traces the path to destination and discovers MTU along this path by using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is similar to traceroute, but it does not require superuser (root) privileges. Follow these guidelines: \u0002 If the application data is less than or equal to 1400 bytes, use an MTU size of 1492. \u0002 If the application is able to send larger chunks of data, use an MTU size of 8992. Important: The direct-attached OSA configuration is not a recommended configuration. Use it with extreme caution. It is a single point of failure in an otherwise highly available environment. It can also become packed and stall, triggering rollbacks or failures in fault-intolerant consumers. The VSWITCH does not exhibit this weakness and remains the recommended method. Important: These MTU sizes are all-inclusive. They apply to z/VM and Linux virtual servers running under z/VM. 56 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2",
