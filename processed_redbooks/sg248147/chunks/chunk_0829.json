If you are adding details to a statement, such as PORT or GATEWAY that spans multiple lines, you must include the entire existing statement not just the new details you want to add. After you create the file, you can use the OBEYFILE command to tell TCP/IP to process the file by using the following command: OBEYFILE fn ft Where fn is the name of the file you created, and ft is the file type (if you used the file type TCPIP for your obey file, you do not need to specify it). If you did not set up RACF on your system, you must provide the read password of the TCPMAINT 198 disk as an option to this command. When you run the OBEYFILE command, you receive a response. If TCP/IP encountered any errors in processing your obey file, you receive a message saying that a file that includes more messages was sent to your reader. You must review this file to see whether your TCP/IP statements were processed correctly.",
