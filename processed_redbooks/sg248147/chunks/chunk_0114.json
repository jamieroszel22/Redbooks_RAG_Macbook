  "content": "Considerably more VMs can be consolidated into a single LPAR, depending on workload characteristics \u2013 Reduced administrative expense through managing a smaller number of large-capacity z/VM host servers \u0002 Improved performance with z/VM HiperDispatch. \u0002 More efficient use of CPU hardware resources for dispatched work. \u0002 IBM adopted OpenStack as part of its cloud strategy. IBM is making contributions to the OpenStack project that are designed to enable z/VM 6.3 to be the first IBM System z\u00ae operating environment to be managed by these open cloud architecture-based interfaces. \u0002 Simplified migration to z/VM V6.3 with upgrade in place, which reduces the effect of an upgrade on active workloads. \u0002 Highly secure industry-standard support that is required for banking and financial-industry applications. \u0002 Support for the new IBM zEnterprise\u00ae EC12 (zEC12) and IBM zEnterprise BC12 (zBC12) servers. \u0002 The use of expanded memory is now deprecated. z/VM 6.2 z/VM 6.2 (December 2011 - June 2017)",
