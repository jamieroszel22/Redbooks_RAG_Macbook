This system is used to build service packages that are delivered to a set of defined managed systems. The z/VM CSM principal system builds service levels by using VMSES/E commands. When a system is participating in z/VM CSM, a dedicated FTP server is set up specifically for transporting service levels and the communication between principal and managed systems. A new command, SERVMGR, is used to manage z/VM CSM. SERVMGR uses VMSES/E commands to apply service and local modifications, build serviced content, and drive the transport of z/VM CSM packaged service to managed systems. z/VM CSM uses Shared File System (SFS) directories to manage service levels for the managed systems. Management of these directories is handled by SERVMGR. 9.1.1 z/VM CSM",
