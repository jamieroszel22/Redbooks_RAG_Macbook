Before live relocation, it was sufficient to merely set up a VSWITCH without an external interface to accomplish these tasks. However, when you try to run this interconnect between hosts that run on a cross-central processor complex (CPC) SSI cluster, the private interconnect must be able to connect the network on the guests regardless of which CPC the guest is running on. 14.1.1 Directory Network Authorization APAR VM65925 for z/VM 6.4, included in the base of z/VM 7.1 and later, provides a new and simplified process for defining and connecting guests to VSWITCHes called Directory Network Authorization (DNA).
