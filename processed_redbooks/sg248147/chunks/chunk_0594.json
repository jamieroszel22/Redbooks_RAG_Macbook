To use them, you must first rename them to a file type of SERVLINK and decompress them by using the DETERSE command. Therefore, it is recommended to leave the file name of the SES envelope unchanged and change the prefix letter of the documentation envelope to D. First, rename them, and then, use the DETERSE command with the (REPLACE parameter to decompress them in place and save disk space: ==> rename s1041690 shiptfss c = servlink = ==> rename s1041690 shipdocs c d1041690 servlink = ==> deterse s1041690 servlink c = = = (replace ==> deterse d1041690 servlink c = = = (replace Ensure that all commands complete successfully. 8.4.4",
