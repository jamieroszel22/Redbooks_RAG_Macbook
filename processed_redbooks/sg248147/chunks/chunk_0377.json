Link to the RACFVM 200 and RACFVM 300 disks read-only with the VMLINK command: ===> vmlink racfvm 200 DMSVML2060I RACFVM 200 linked as 0120 file mode Z ===> vmlink racfvm 300 DMSVML2060I RACFVM 300 linked as 0121 file mode X Note: When RACF is installed in a single-member or multiple-member z/VM single system image (SSI) environment, the RACF database must be configured as being shared. Important: If your SSI is on LPARs at the first level, you must use real volumes for the 200 and 300 RACF database, they cannot be minidisks. Use the smallest volumes that you can get because the RACF database does not need many cylinders, even mod-3 is more than enough in most cases. It is not recommended to use volumes with more than 32,760 cylinders. Chapter 6. Configuring z/VM 161 The virtual device addresses of the linked disks are 120 (for RACFVM 200) and 121 (for RACFVM 300). 5. Copy the RACFVM 200 disk (120) to the 103B",
