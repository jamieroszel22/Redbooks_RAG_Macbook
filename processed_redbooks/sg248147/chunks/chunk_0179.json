  "content": "inadvertently create any possible problems. 2.9.2 Open Systems Adapters For use with z/VM and Linux in the ways described in this book, Open Systems Adapters (OSAs) are needed, which are a type of OSD. An OSA in OSD mode is operating in queued direct input/output (QDIO). IBM developed the QDIO mode to enhance high-speed OSA Express adapters. It brings with it many features, such as fast-path I/O, direct memory addressing, LPAR-to-LPAR capabilities, and configuration-from-host options. The following rules apply to configuring OSA OSD adapters for use: \u0002 READ/WRITE must be an even/odd pair: \u2013 READ is set to an even device number. \u2013 WRITE is set to the device number after READ. \u0002 DATA can be another device number on the same device, it is nearly always the device number following the WRITE device. A good method to provide this type of device is the read, write, data method: \u0002 The first device gets 0AD0, 0AD1, and 0AD2. \u0002 The second device gets 0AD4, 0AD5, 0AD6 or 0AD6, 0AD7, and 0AD8.",
