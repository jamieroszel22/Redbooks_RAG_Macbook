Reference your planning worksheet and attach all DASDs that are part of the VMSSI cluster to your virtual machine by using the ATTACH command. The * that is used in the ATTACH command means \u201cself\u201d (the ID that is running the command). In this example, we used the following command: ===> attach 923e 92be 933e 93be 943e to * 15:40:57 DASD 923E ATTACHED TO MAINT 923E WITH DEVCTL HYPERPAV BASE 15:40:57 DASD 92BE ATTACHED TO MAINT 92BE WITH DEVCTL HYPERPAV BASE 15:40:57 DASD 933E ATTACHED TO MAINT 933E WITH DEVCTL HYPERPAV BASE 15:40:57 DASD 93BE ATTACHED TO MAINT 93BE WITH DEVCTL HYPERPAV BASE 15:40:57 DASD 943E ATTACHED TO MAINT 943E WITH DEVCTL HYPERPAV BASE 10.Run the INSTALL command. The DASD is formatted and the z/VM system disks are copied, as shown in Figure 5-3. This step usually takes more than one hour: ===> install Example 5-3",
