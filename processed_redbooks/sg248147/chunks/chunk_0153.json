Specific larger IBM Z or LinuxONE system customer environments are choosing to use volumes that are larger than 3390-27s to avoid reaching the 64 K limit of real device addresses (four-character hexadecimal). EDEVICEs SCSI Disks are emulated as 9336 Model 20 FBA DASD. FBA Emulation allows any operating system or application that supports a 9336 to use SCSI disks without change. The following Emulated 9336 disk sizes are supported: \u0002 1 TB for CP with the exception that PAGE, SPOL, and DRCT allocations must remain below the 64 GB (minus a 4 K page) mark on a CP-formatted volume because internal addressing of these slots is limited to 224 4-K pages. \u0002 381 GB for CMS/GCS including software functions that depend on CMS functions, such as DIRMAINT MOVE, COPY, ERASE and DFSMS MOVE, COPY, and CHECK. z/VM officially supports the following IBM hardware",
