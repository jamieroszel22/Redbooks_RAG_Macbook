Credentials are not shared, and only an administrator who is authorized to log on to the shared ID is permitted to do so. Also, when managed by using an ESM, audit records are generated for every successful (or failed) attempt to log on as a shared ID. IBMVM1 ID With z/VM 7.1, IBM delivered the IBMVM1 user ID to demonstrate the correct use of the surrogate logon capability. In the default directory that is installed with z/VM 7.1, IBMVM1 is used to access most of the shared IDs on the system. Note: Configuring SEVER YES in the SMF CONTROL file affects system availability if the SMF data disks fills and SMF data cannot be recorded. The workload continues to operate, but no users can log on nor are any connections to RACF-controlled resources permitted. Although SEVER YES is the recommended configuration, it must not be set",
