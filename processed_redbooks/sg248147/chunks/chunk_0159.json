  "content": "of Linux, but it is important to realize that Linux does not \u201cswap\u201d process spaces in the traditional sense. The Linux behavior that is commonly referred to as swapping is the paging of data out of system memory to a block device based on least recently used (LRU) algorithms. For historical reasons, the term swap is still shown and used, but it refers to paging in Linux. Swap is also used to help delineate paging at the Linux level (swap disk), in contrast to paging at the z/VM level. z/VM includes a feature that is called virtual disks (VDisks). VDisks exist in memory but are presented to guest operating systems as disks. IBM Z memory is fast (many times faster than disk especially); therefore, the use of VDisks for swap spaces makes sense because they are so fast. Ideally, your Linux systems never have to swap, but workloads cannot be predicted so easily. Therefore, all Linux VMs must have an adequate set of swap spaces. What defines \u201can adequate set of swap space\u201d is debatable.",
