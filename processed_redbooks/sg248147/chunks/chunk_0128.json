However, non-VMSSI installations are still in use, mostly at installations where ECKD DASD, as described in Part 1.4.1, \u201cHardware\u201d on page 18, is not present. When z/VM is installed to SCSI-over-FCP disk, the use of VMSSI is not possible. In addition, a new service mode was introduced with z/VM 7.2. Called VM Centralized Service Management (VMCSM). This capability allows a single non-VMSSI system to generate service updates for other non-VMSSI systems. If you are just getting started with z/VM and were not planning to use the VMSSI feature immediately, we still encourage you to install z/VM as a VMSSI cluster with only one member node to facilitate expansion in the future. Adding nodes to an existing cluster is much easier than having to start from square one. 2 34 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 This chapter includes the",
