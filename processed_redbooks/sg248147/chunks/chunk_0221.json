Security considerations 75 3.3 Separation of authority No single individual (or group) should have sole responsibility for establishing, maintaining, configuring, and enforcing the security policy. However, many hypervisor systems are configured in that way; that is, a single ID or privilege level provides universal authority over all aspects of system management. A single focus of administration makes it far too easy for a system to be compromised through the actions of a small number of people, or even an individual. z/VM can help to separate administrative roles into separate IDs, which makes it difficult for the actions of an individual (accidental or malicious) to create a security event.
