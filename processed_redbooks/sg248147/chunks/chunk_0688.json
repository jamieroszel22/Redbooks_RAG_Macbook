DirMaint provides the capability to clone a SUBCONFIG entry by using an existing SUBCONFIG entry. By using the :SSI_VOLUMES section, you can define the DASD volumes that DirMaint will use when it allocates the new minidisks that are associated with the new cloned SUBCONFIG entry. Entries within the :SSI_VOLUMES section define the DASD volume that corresponds to the user-defined set of volumes across each member of the SSI cluster.
