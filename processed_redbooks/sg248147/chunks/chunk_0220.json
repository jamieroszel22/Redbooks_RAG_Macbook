On RACF, auditing is provided by using SMF. To ensure that the audit trail is reliable, it is important to configure SMF to write the audit data out to persistent storage when the SMF data disk fills. SMF on z/VM RACF provides two data disks for this purpose, and by default switches from one recording disk to the other when one fills. To ensure that it can switch back again when the second disk fills, some processing is required to clean up the data disk and prepare it for its next use. RACF also allows the system administrator to configure how the system is to respond if both audit data disks ever fills or otherwise become unusable.
