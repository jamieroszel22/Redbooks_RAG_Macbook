It is still recommended that you proceed by using the VMSSI path. The installation of a single-member VMSSI cluster provides you with an easy path for future expansion to add member nodes later. If you are installing to SCSI disk, you cannot install with VMSSI enabled. However, non-SSI installations can use the z/VM Centralized Service Management (VMCSM) capability that was introduced with z/VM 7.2.
