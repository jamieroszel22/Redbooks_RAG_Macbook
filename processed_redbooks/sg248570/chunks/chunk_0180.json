IBM watsonx.data bridges this gap by allowing users to treat these open-format files as if they were relational tables. A virtualized Chapter 5. Querying and manipulating data and leveraging persona-specific engines 83 metadata layer provides logical schemas for these files, allowing familiar SQL constructs like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and WINDOW functions to operate seamlessly across them. By providing a uniform SQL layer over both structured warehouse data and",
