To implement these groups, assign roles to them: Storage Admin: Granted to the Admin group. Storage Reader: Granted to the Analyst group. Storage Writer: Granted to the Data Engineer group. If a specific analyst, such as Tom, needs temporary write access to a file, a policy-based ACL can be created to grant him that permission for a specific period. This approach allows for flexibility without compromising overall security. Importantly, Tom retains his usual read-only access to other files in the storage. Using role hierarchies for simplified management IBM watsonx.data uses RBAC with role hierarchies. This approach simplifies permission management by enabling higher-level roles to inherit permissions from lower-level roles, which reduce redundancy. Here is the role hierarchy: \u0002 Storage Reader: The lowest level, which grants read-only access. \u0002 Storage Writer: Inherits Storage Reader",
