  "content": "low-cost object storage; extract more value from the data in ineffective data lakes. Some of the key capabilities of watsonx.data are: \u0002 Scaling for BI across all data with multiple high-performance query engines optimized for different workloads (for example: Presto, Spark, Db2, Netezza, and so forth. \u0002 Enabling data-sharing between these different engines. \u0002 Using shared common data storage across data lake and data warehouse functions, avoiding unnecessary time-consuming ETL/ELT jobs. \u0002 Eradicating unnecessary data duplication and replication. \u0002 Providing consistent governance, security, and user experience across hybrid multi-clouds. \u0002 Leveraging an open and flexible architecture built on open source without vendor lock-in. \u0002 The ability to be deployed across hybrid-cloud environments (on-premises, private, public clouds) on multiple hyperscalers. \u0002 Offering a wide range of prebuilt integration capabilities incorporating IBM data-fabric capabilities. \u0002 Providing global governance",
