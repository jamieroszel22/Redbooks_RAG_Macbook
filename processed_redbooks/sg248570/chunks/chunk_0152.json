Coordinators communicate with workers and clients using a REST API. Worker After ensuring that an appropriate number of resources are available, the coordinator delegates these tasks to the worker nodes. Worker nodes process their tasks in parallel, using the relevant connector to access the underlying data source. The connector used can vary across workers, depending on how the query was optimized and what data sources need to be accessed. As the worker nodes process their tasks, the coordinator continually monitors them using heartbeat signals. Once workers are done, the result of the tasks is sent back to the coordinator. The coordinator can then assign workers new tasks from any remaining query stages. Once all stages are complete, the coordinator compiles the results from each stage into the final form required by the",
