Because communication with the Java coordinator and across workers is only done using the REST endpoints, Presto C++ does not use JNI and does not require a JVM on worker nodes. Presto aims to be the top performing system for data lakes. To achieve this goal, the Presto community is moving the Presto evaluation engine from the",
