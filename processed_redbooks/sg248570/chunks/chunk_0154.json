  "content": "access to built-in system tables, a Hive connector, and a TPCH connector designed to serve TPC-H benchmark data. Many third-party developers have contributed connectors so that Presto can access data in a variety of data sources. Every catalog is associated with a specific connector. If you examine a catalog configuration file, you will see that each contains a mandatory property connector.name which is used by the catalog manager to create a connector for a given catalog. It is possible to have more than one catalog use the same connector to access two different instances of a similar database. For example, if you have two Hive clusters, you can configure two catalogs in a single Presto cluster that both use the Hive connector, allowing you to query data from both Hive clusters (even within the same SQL query). Catalog A Presto catalog includes schemas and refers to a data source using a connector. For example, you can configure a JMX catalog to provide access to JMX information via",
