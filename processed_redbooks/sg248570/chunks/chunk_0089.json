Data unification and accessibility The following benefits for data unification and accessibility can be achieved: \u0002 watsonx.data leverages open formats (for example, Parquet, Delta Lake) to store and process data, making it accessible to all three tools (Spark, DataStage, StreamSets). \u0002 It provides a single source of truth for AI and analytics workloads. Scalability and performance There are several scalability and performance benefits, such as: \u0002 Apache Spark ensures scalable compute for large-scale analytics. 26 Simplify Your AI Journey: Hybrid, Open Data Lakehouse with IBM watsonx.data \u0002 DataStage efficiently manages ETL workflows to prepare high-quality data. \u0002 StreamSets delivers real-time data with low latency, keeping watsonx.data pipelines dynamic and up-to-date. Governance and compliance Key governance and compliance features include: \u0002",
