  "content": "analytics remain safe, compliant, and trustworthy, while still allowing analysts to work effectively with the data. Performance enhancements for analytical queries A central tenet of the lakehouse philosophy is delivering data warehouse-like performance on top of flexible, open storage. This balance demands more than just fast hardware: it requires a deep integration between query engines, metadata systems, and the underlying file formats to deliver sub-second or interactive query speeds over massive, ever-growing datasets. IBM watsonx.data fully embraces the performance-oriented features available in lakehouse architectures, including: Chapter 5. Querying and manipulating data and leveraging persona-specific engines 85 \u0002 Partitioning and clustering: By logically grouping related data-such as by date, region, product category, or other attributes-organizations can localize queries to specific partitions, reducing the volume of data scanned. Clustering similar data together further",
