  "content": "challenges. Figure 1-2 On-premises, cloud-native warehouses, and custom data lakes are commonly found in enterprise architectures Most lakehouse solutions offer a high-performance query engine over low-cost storage with a metadata governance layer. Intelligent metadata layers enable users to categorize and classify unstructured data (such as video and voice) and semi-structured data (such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and emails). In an ideal world, a lakehouse offers open-source technologies that reduce data duplication and simplify complex Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines. Some first-generation lakehouses have key constraints that limit their ability to address the challenges of cost and complexity. For example, a single-query engine that is designed for BI or ML workloads might be ineffective when it is used for another workload type. Different workloads should be optimized with the best-suited environment to keep costs at a minimum",
