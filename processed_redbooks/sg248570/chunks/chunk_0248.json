This approach helps improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated content by grounding it in external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or other types of structured and unstructured data. RAG enables enterprises to transform resources such as policy manuals, training documents, or logs into a structured knowledge base that enhances LLMs. This approach benefits applications in",
