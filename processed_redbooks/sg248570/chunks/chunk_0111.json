StreamSets provides real-time data ingestion at scale so that you can deploy reliable, smart streaming data pipelines across hybrid cloud environments at scale. StreamSets pipelines stream structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from any source. StreamSets also automatically detects changes in data structures and schemas and sends alerts about them, so you can seamlessly adapt to changing business requirements with zero downtime. These intelligent data pipelines also adapt to unexpected data structural shifts with drag-and-drop, pre-built processors to automatically identify and adapt to data drift. The net effect is to",
