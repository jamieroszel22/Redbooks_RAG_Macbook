Stages are what the coordinator uses to model a distributed query plan, but stages themselves do not run on Presto workers. Task As mentioned in \u201cStage\u201d on page 65, stages model a particular section of a distributed query plan, but stages themselves do not execute on Presto workers. To understand how a stage is executed, you'll need to understand that a stage is implemented as a series of tasks distributed over a network of Presto workers. Tasks are the work horse in the Presto architecture. A distributed query plan is deconstructed into a series of stages which are then translated to tasks which then act upon or process splits. A Presto task has inputs and outputs, and just as a stage can be executed in parallel by a series of tasks, a task is executing in parallel with a series of drivers. Split Tasks operate on splits which are sections of a larger data set. Stages at the lowest level of a distributed",
