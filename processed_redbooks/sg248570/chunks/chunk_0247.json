Adopting Milvus for RAG using IBM watsonx By combining the generative power of large language models (LLMs) with the precision of information retrieval, Retrieval-Augmented (RAG) systems can deliver more accurate, relevant, and contextually rich outputs. This integration becomes even more powerful when leveraging robust vector databases like Milvus alongside comprehensive AI platforms such as IBM watsonx. This approach allows developers to build sophisticated RAG pipelines that efficiently manage and query massive datasets, enriching the capabilities of",
