  "content": "the open lakehouse framework. 4.1.1 Overview of user and group management in open lakehouses User and group management in a lakehouse environment involves defining roles, policies, and permissions that dictate who can access data and under what conditions. Effective user and group management allows organizations to accomplish the following goals: \u0002 Control data access: Ensure that users access only the data that they are permitted to see. \u0002 Simplify permission assignments: Use groups and roles to efficiently assign permissions to multiple users. \u0002 Maintain auditability: Track and monitor data access for regulatory and compliance requirements. \u0002 Enable scalability: Implement access controls that support large and diverse teams without manual overhead. With lakehouses, where data might be semi-structured or unstructured and stored across distributed systems, maintaining this level of control and visibility requires advanced strategies, which include the use of attribute-based access",
