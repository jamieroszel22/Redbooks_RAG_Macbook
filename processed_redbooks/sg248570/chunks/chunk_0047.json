Enterprises can also complement their data warehouses to support some of these new types of AI- and ML-driven workloads. A lakehouse, as shown in Figure 1-1, attempts to bridge data warehouses and data lakes by combining the best of both into one architecture. That said, these first-generation lakehouses have constraints that limit their ability to address cost and complexity challenges: \u0002 Single-query engines are set up to support limited workloads, typically just for BI and ML. \u0002 Lakehouses are typically deployed only over the cloud, with no support for hybrid multi-cloud deployments. \u0002 Lakehouses offer minimal governance and metadata capabilities to deploy across an entire",
