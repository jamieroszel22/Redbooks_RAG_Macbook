The integration of tools like Apache Spark, ETL tools like DataStage\u00ae, and StreamSets plays a crucial role in shaping the pipeline's functionality. 2.4.1 Apache Spark: The computational engine Apache Spark serves as a distributed data processing engine, capable of handling large-scale data with its in-memory computation capabilities. In an open lakehouse, Spark is often the go-to engine for data transformation, analytics, and machine learning workloads. 1 This cost reduction was calculated by comparing published 2023 list prices normalized for virtual private cloud (VPC) hours of IBM",
