It can handle large-scale datasets with Milvus\u2019s distributed vector database for fast querying. The Milvus service can be added in watsonx.data with multiple sizings based on user\u2019s need. The Starter size can support 1 million vectors and the Large size can support 100 million vectors. If a user requires more vectors, they can work with IBM to customize their watsonx.data instance to support them. Security IBM watsonx.data provides enterprise-grade fine-grained access control to protect the data. Chapter 4 describes",
