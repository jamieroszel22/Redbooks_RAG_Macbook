A governance and metadata layer integrates existing Netezza and Db2 services to achieve metadata sharing using open-data formats such as Parquet, ORC, and Avro (a serialization format for record data and for streaming data pipelines) and leverages the Apache Iceberg table format. It uses multiple engines, such as Presto and Spark, which provide fast, reliable, efficient processing of big data at scale. Let us take a look at each layer in more detail.
