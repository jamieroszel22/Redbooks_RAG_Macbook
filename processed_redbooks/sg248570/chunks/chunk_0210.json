Unlike basic search engines that rely on simple keyword matching, the IBM watsonx.data search engine incorporates advanced Boolean operators, filters, and facets to help users create highly specific queries by combining multiple search parameters to narrow down results with precision. With Boolean operators, users can include or exclude data sets based on criteria such as tags, metadata fields, or data set attributes.
