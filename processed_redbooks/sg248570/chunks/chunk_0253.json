  "content": "vectors, or \u201cembeddings\u201d are essential for efficient information retrieval and are a foundational component in RAG. Embeddings transform textual data into a format that captures its meaning in a way that computers can understand and compare. Similar pieces of text (based on meaning, not just words) have embeddings that are closer together in vector space. For example, sentences like \u201cThe cat is sleeping on the mat\u201d and \u201cA cat is napping on a rug\u201d would be represented by embeddings that are close to each other in that high-dimensional space. When a user query is issued, it\u2019s also transformed into an embedding. The retrieval system then finds the stored document embeddings that are closest to the query embedding in vector space, using similarity measures like cosine similarity, etc. Embeddings are typically generated by pre-trained models like BERT, or IBM embedding models in watsonx.ai.
