The AI studio provides a range of foundation models, training and tuning tools, and a cost-effective infrastructure that facilitates the entire data and AI lifecycle, from data preparation through model development, deployment, and monitoring. Additionally, a foundation model library that gives users easy access to IBM-curated and -trained foundation models. Foundation models use a large, curated set of enterprise data, backed by a robust filtering and cleansing process and with an auditable data lineage. These models are being trained not only on language, but on a variety of modalities, including code, time-series data, tabular data, geospatial",
