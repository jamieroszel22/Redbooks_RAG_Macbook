  "content": "query plan retrieve data via splits from connectors, and intermediate stages at a higher level of a distributed query plan retrieve data from other stages. When Presto is scheduling a query, the coordinator will query a connector for a list of all splits that are available for a table. The coordinator keeps track of which machines are running which tasks and what splits are being processed by which tasks. Driver Tasks contain one or more parallel drivers. Drivers act upon data and combine operators to produce output that is then aggregated by a task and delivered to another task in another stage. A driver is a sequence of operator instances. You can think of a driver as a physical set of operators in memory. It is the lowest level of parallelism in the Presto architecture. A driver has one input and one output. 66 Simplify Your AI Journey: Hybrid, Open Data Lakehouse with IBM watsonx.data Operator An operator consumes, transforms, and produces data.
