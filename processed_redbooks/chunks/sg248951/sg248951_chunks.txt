 The IBM z16 is no exception. It has a new processor chip design with each processor unit (PU) running at 5.2 GHz. IBM 16 provides 17% more processor capacity per CPC drawer compared to the IBM z15.

The new processor chip design has a new cache hierarchy, on-chip AI accelerator that is shared by the PU cores, transparent memory encryption, and increased uniprocessor capacity (single thread and SMT similar).

The on-chip AI scoring logic provides submicrosecond AI inferencing for deep learning and complex neural network models.

The redesigned cache structure features the following cache sizes:

- /SM590000 256 KB L1 per PU core
- /SM590000 32 MB semi-private L2 per PU core
- /SM590000 256 MB (logical) shared victim virtual L3 per chip
- /SM590000 2 GB (logical) shared victim virtual L4 per CPC drawer

The result is improved system performance and scalability with 1.5x more cache capacity per core over the IBM z15 and reduced average access latency through a flatter topology.



--- Chunk 155 ---
al L4 per CPC drawer

The result is improved system performance and scalability with 1.5x more cache capacity per core over the IBM z15 and reduced average access latency through a flatter topology.

The IBM z16 (machine type 3931) has one model: the A01. The maximum number of characterizable processor units (PUs) with the IBM z16 is represented by feature names: Max39, Max82, Max125, Max168, and Max200.

The number of characterizable PUs, spare PUs, System Assist Processors (SAPs), and Integrated Firmware Processors (IFP) are included with each IBM z16 feature (see Table 1-1).

With Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency, you can remotely shift capacity and production workloads between IBM z16 systems at different sites on demand with no onsite personnel or IBM intervention. This capability is designed to help you proactively avoid disruptions from unplanned events and planned scenarios, such as site facility maintenance.
- /SM590000 IBM z16 System Recovery Boost enhancements provide boosted processor capacity and parallelism for specific events. Client-selected middleware starts and restarts to expedite recovery for middleware regions and restore steady-state operations as soon as possible.

- /SM590000 On IBM z16, the enhanced ICA-SR coupling link protocol provides up to 10% improvement for read requests and lock requests, and up to 25% for write requests and duplexed write requests, compared to CF service times on IBM z15 systems. The improved CF service times for CF requests can translate into better Parallel Sysplex coupling efficiency; therefore, the software costs can be reduced for the attached z/OS images in the Parallel Sysplex.
- /SM590000 IBM z16 provides improved CF processor scalability for CF images. Compared to IBM z15, the relative scaling of a CF image beyond a 9-way is significantly improved; that is, that the effective capacity of IBM z16 CF images continues to increase meaningfully all the way up to the maximum of 16 processors in a CF image.

e beyond a 9-way is significantly improved; that is, that the effective capacity of IBM z16 CF images continues to increase meaningfully all the way up to the maximum of 16 processors in a CF image.

The IBM z16 also added functions to protect today's data now, and from future cyberattacks that can be initiated by quantum computers. The IBM z16 provides the following quantum-safe capabilities:

- /SM590000 Key generation
- /SM590000 Encryption
- /SM590000 Key encapsulation mechanisms
- /SM590000 Hybrid key exchange schemes
- /SM590000 Dual digital signature schemes

In addition to these quantum-safe cryptographic capabilities, tools (such as IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence [ADDI], Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility [ICSF], and IBM Crypto Analytics Monitor [CAT]) can help you discover where and what cryptography is used in applications. This knowledge can aid in developing a cryptographic inventory for migration and modernization planning.

1.1.2  Capacity and performance

The IBM z16 A01 offers 317 capacity levels. In all, 200 capacity levels are based on the number of physically used CPs, plus up to 117 extra subcapacity models for the first 39 CPs.

The IBM z16 provides increased processing and enhanced I/O capabilities over its predecessor, the IBM z15 T01. This capacity is achieved by increasing the number of PUs per system, redesigning the system cache, and introducing new I/O technologies.

nced I/O capabilities over its predecessor, the IBM z15 T01. This capacity is achieved by increasing the number of PUs per system, redesigning the system cache, and introducing new I/O technologies.

The IBM z16 feature Max200 is estimated to provide up to 17% more total system capacity than the IBM z15 Model Max190, with the same amount of memory and power requirements. With up to 40 TB of main storage and enhanced SMT, the performance of the IBM z16 A01 processors deliver considerable improvement. Uniprocessor performance also increased significantly. An IBM z16 Model 701 offers average performance improvements of up to 11% over the IBM z15 Model 701. 2

ssors deliver considerable improvement. Uniprocessor performance also increased significantly. An IBM z16 Model 701 offers average performance improvements of up to 11% over the IBM z15 Model 701. 2

The Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and IBM Z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) processor units on the IBM z16 can be configured to run two simultaneous threads in a single processor (SMT). This feature increases the capacity of these processors with 25% in average 2  over processors that are running single thread. SMT is also enabled by default on System Assist Processors (SAPs).

Within each single drawer, IBM z16 provides 25% greater capacity than IBM z15 for standard models and 40% greater capacity on the maximum configured model, which enables efficient partition scaling.



--- Chunk 363 ---
Within each single drawer, IBM z16 provides 25% greater capacity than IBM z15 for standard models and 40% greater capacity on the maximum configured model, which enables efficient partition scaling.

This comparison is based on the Large System Performance Reference (LSPR) mixed workload analysis. The range of performance ratings across the individual LSPR workloads is likely to feature a large spread. More performance variation of individual logical partitions (LPARs) is available when an increased number of partitions and more PUs are available. For more information, see Chapter 12, 'Performance and capacity planning' on page 473.

With the IBM z16, Virtual Flash Memory (VFM) feature is offered from the main memory capacity in 0.5 TB units to increase granularity for the feature. VFM can provide much simpler management and better performance by eliminating the I/O to the adapters in the PCIe+ I/O drawers.

1.2.3  I/O subsystem and I/O drawers

The IBM z16 supports a PCIe I/O infrastructure. PCIe features are installed in PCIe+ I/O drawers. Up to 12 I/O drawers per IBM z16 can be ordered, which allows for up to 192 PCIe I/O and special purpose features.

For a four CPC drawer system, up to 48 PCIe+ fan-out slots can be populated with fan-out cards for data communications between the CPC drawers and the I/O infrastructure, and for coupling. The multiple channel subsystem (CSS) architecture allows up to six CSSs, each with 256 channels.

The IBM z16 implements PCIe Generation 4, which is used to connect the PCIe+ Gen3 dual port fan-out features in the CPC drawers. The I/O infrastructure is designed to reduce processor usage and I/O latency, and provide increased throughput and availability.

Together with the PCIe features, the PCIe+ I/O drawer offers finer granularity and capacity over previous I/O infrastructures. It can be concurrently added and removed in the field, which eases planning. Only PCIe cards (features) are supported, in any combination.

1.2.4  Storage connectivity

Storage connectivity is provided on the IBM z16 by FICON Express and the IBM zHyperLink Express features.

FICON Express

FICON Express features follow the established Fibre Channel (FC) standards to support data storage and access requirements, along with the latest FC technology in storage and access devices. FICON Express features support the following protocols:

- /SM590000 FICON



--- Chunk 574 ---
andards to support data storage and access requirements, along with the latest FC technology in storage and access devices. FICON Express features support the following protocols:

- /SM590000 FICON

This enhanced protocol (as compared to FC) provides for communication across channels, channel-to-channel (CTC) connectivity, and with FICON devices, such as disks, tapes, and printers. It is used in z/OS, z/VM, IBM z/VSEfi (Virtual Storage Extended), z/TPF (Transaction Processing Facility), and Linux on IBM Z environments.

- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)

This standard protocol is used for communicating with disk and tape devices through FC switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z environments.



--- Chunk 575 ---
disk and tape devices through FC switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z environments.

FICON Express32S features are implemented by using PCIe cards, and offer better port granularity and improved capabilities over the previous FICON Express features. FICON Express32S features support a link data rate of 32 gigabytes per second (Gbps) (8, 16, or 32 Gbps auto-negotiate), and it is the preferred technology for new systems.

zHyperLink Express

d it is the preferred technology for new systems.

zHyperLink Express

zHyperLink was created to provide fast access to data by way of low-latency connections between the IBM Z platform and storage.

The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature allows you to make synchronous requests for data that is in the storage cache of the IBM DS8900F. This process is done by directly connecting the zHyperLink Express1.1 port in the IBM z16 to an I/O Bay port of the IBM DS8000. This short distance (up to 150 m [492 feet), direct connection is designed for low-latency reads and writes, such as with IBM DB2fi for z/OS synchronous I/O reads and log writes.

Working with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve application response time, which cuts I/O-sensitive workload response time in half without requiring application changes. 3

Working with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve application response time, which cuts I/O-sensitive workload response time in half without requiring application changes. 3

Note: The zHyperLink channels complement FICON channels, but they do not replace FICON channels. FICON remains the main data driver and is mandatory for zHyperLink usage.

1.2.5  Network connectivity

The IBM z16 is a fully virtualized platform that can support many system images at once. Therefore, network connectivity covers not only the connections between the platform and external networks with Open Systems Adapter-Express (OSA-Express) and RoCE Express features, it supports specialized internal connections for intra-system communication through IBM HiperSockets and Internal Shared Memory (ISM).

OSA-Express



--- Chunk 578 ---
r-Express (OSA-Express) and RoCE Express features, it supports specialized internal connections for intra-system communication through IBM HiperSockets and Internal Shared Memory (ISM).

OSA-Express

The OSA-Express features provide local area network (LAN) connectivity and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, OSA-Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.

OSA-Express7S 1.2 features continue to support copper and fiber optic (single-mode and multimode) environments.

HiperSockets

IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the IBM Z platforms that supplies attachments to up to 32 high-speed virtual LANs, with minimal system and network overhead.

nvironments.

HiperSockets

IBM HiperSockets is an integrated function of the IBM Z platforms that supplies attachments to up to 32 high-speed virtual LANs, with minimal system and network overhead.

HiperSockets is a function of the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). It provides LAN connectivity across multiple system images on the same IBM Z platform by performing memory-to-memory data transfers in a secure way.

The HiperSockets function eliminates the use of I/O subsystem operations. It also eliminates having to traverse an external network connection to communicate between LPARs in the same IBM Z platform. In this way, HiperSockets can help with server consolidation by connecting virtual servers and simplifying the enterprise network.

RoCE Express

The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3 features 4  use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory communications between two IBM Z platforms.

The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3 features 4  use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) to provide fast memory-to-memory communications between two IBM Z platforms.

These features help reduce consumption of CPU resources for applications that use the TCP/IP stack (such as IBM WebSpherefi that accesses an IBM Db2fi database). They also can help reduce network latency with memory-to-memory transfers by using Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R).

With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly and at low latency. SMC-R is transparent to the application and requires no code changes, which enables rapid time to value.

With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly and at low latency. SMC-R is transparent to the application and requires no code changes, which enables rapid time to value.

The RoCE Express3 features also can provide LAN connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.

Internal Shared Memory

ISM is a virtual Peripheral Component Express (PCI) network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory. It provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z platform intra-communications.

l Peripheral Component Express (PCI) network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory. It provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z platform intra-communications.

Shared Memory Communications-Direct Memory Access (SMC-D) uses ISM. SMC-D optimizes operating systems communications in a way that is transparent to socket applications. It also reduces the CPU cost of TCP/IP processing in the data path, which enables highly efficient and application-transparent communications.

SMC-D requires no extra physical resources (such as RoCE Express features, PCIe bandwidth, ports, I/O slots, network resources, or Ethernet switches). Instead, SMC-D uses LPAR-to-LPAR communication through HiperSockets or an OSA-Express feature for establishing the initial connection.

z/OS and Linux on IBM Z support SMC-R and SMC-D. Now, data can be shared by way of memory-to-memory transfer between z/OS and Linux on IBM Z.

1.2.6  Clustering connectivity

A Parallel Sysplex is an IBM Z clustering technology that is used to make applications that are running on logical and physical IBM Z platforms highly reliable and available. The IBM Z platforms in a Parallel Sysplex are interconnected by way of coupling links.

Coupling connectivity on the IBM z16 use Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR) and Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) features. The ICA SR feature supports distances up to 150 meters (492 feet); the CE2 LR feature supports unrepeated distances of up to 10 km (6.21 miles) between IBM Z platforms. ICA SR features provide sysplex and timing connectivity direct to the CPC drawer, while Coupling Express2 LR features connect into the PCIe+ I/O Drawer.

o 10 km (6.21 miles) between IBM Z platforms. ICA SR features provide sysplex and timing connectivity direct to the CPC drawer, while Coupling Express2 LR features connect into the PCIe+ I/O Drawer.

Coupling links also can carry timing information (such as Server Time Protocol [STP]) for synchronizing time across multiple IBM Z CPCs in a Coordinated Time Network (CTN).

1.2.9  Special-purpose features and functions

When it comes to designing and developing the IBM Z platform, IBM takes a total systems view. The IBM Z stack is built around digital services, agile application development, connectivity, and system management. This design approach creates an integrated, diverse platform with specialized hardware and dedicated computing capabilities.

The IBM z16 delivers a range of features and functions that allows PUs to concentrate on computational tasks, while distinct, specialized features take care of the rest. For more information about these features and other IBM z16 features, see in 3.5, 'Processor unit functions' on page 98.

1.3  Hardware management

The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and Support Elements (SEs) are appliances that together provide platform management for IBM Z.

1.3  Hardware management

The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and Support Elements (SEs) are appliances that together provide platform management for IBM Z.

The HMC is an appliance that provides a single point of control for managing local or remote hardware elements.

For IBM z16 new built systems, IBM Z Hardware Management Appliance (FC 0129) is the only available HMC. The HMC Appliance and SE Appliance run virtualized on the SE hardware.

Older stand-alone HMCs (rack-mounted or tower) can be carried forward during an MES upgrade to IBM z16.

For more information, see Chapter 10, 'Hardware Management Console and Support Element' on page 407.

1.4  Reliability, availability, and serviceability

System reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) is an area of continuous IBM focus and a defining IBM Z platform characteristic. The RAS objective is to reduce (or eliminate, if possible) all sources of planned and unplanned outages while providing adequate service information if an issue occurs. Adequate service information is required to determine the cause of an issue without the need to reproduce the context of an event.

IBM Z platforms are designed to enable highest availability and lowest downtime. These facts are recognized by various IT analysts, such as ITIC 9 and IDC 10 . A comprehensive, multi-layered strategy includes the following features:

able highest availability and lowest downtime. These facts are recognized by various IT analysts, such as ITIC 9 and IDC 10 . A comprehensive, multi-layered strategy includes the following features:

- /SM590000 Error Prevention
- /SM590000 Error Detection and Correction
- /SM590000 Error Recovery
- /SM590000 System Recovery Boost

With a suitably configured IBM z16, further reduction of outages can be attained through First Failure Data Capture (FFDC), which is designed to reduce service times and avoid subsequent errors. It also improves nondisruptive replace, repair, and upgrade functions for memory, drawers, and I/O adapters. IBM z16 supports the nondisruptive download and installation of LIC updates.

IBM z16 RAS features provide unique high-availability and nondisruptive operational capabilities that differentiate IBM Z in the marketplace. IBM z16 RAS enhancements are made on many components of the CPC (processor chip, memory subsystem, I/O, and service) in areas, such as error checking, error protection, failure handling, error checking, faster repair capabilities, sparing, and cooling.

The ability to cluster multiple systems in a Parallel Sysplex takes the commercial strengths of the z/OS platform to higher levels of system management, scalable growth, and continuous availability.

The IBM z16 builds on the RAS of the IBM z15™ family with the following RAS improvements:

- /SM590000 System Recovery Boost
- -System Recovery Boost was introduced with IBM z15. It offers customers more Central Processor (CP) capacity during system recovery operations to accelerate the startup (IPL), shutdown, or stand-alone memory dump operations (at image level - LPAR 11 ). System Recovery Boost requires operating system support. No other IBM software charges are made during the boost period.

System Recovery Boost can be used during LPAR shutdown or start to make the running operating system and services available in a shorter period.

The System Recovery Boost provides the following options for the capacity increase:

- /SM590000 System Recovery Boost enhancements that are delivered with the IBM z16 maximize service availability by using tailored short-duration boosts to mitigate the effect of the following recovery processes:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; IBM SAN Volume Controller memory dump boost boosts the system on which the IBM SAN Volume Controller memory dump is taken to reduce system affect and expedite diagnostic capture. It is possible to enable, disable, or set thresholds for this option.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Middleware restart/recycle boost boosts the system on which a middleware instance is being restarted to expedite resource recovery processing, release retained locks, and so on. It is applicable to planned restarts, or restarts after failure, automated, or ARM-driven restarts. System Recovery Boost do not boost any system address spaces by default and must be configured by the WLM policy specification.

wap Configuration Load boost is enabled by default. No thresholds or criteria are applied to the boost request based on the size or number of devices that are present in the HyperSwap configuration.

Through System Recovery Boost, the IBM z16 continues to offer more CP capacity during specific system recovery operations to accelerate system (operating system and services) start when the system is being started or shutdown. System Recovery Boost is operating system-dependent. No other hardware, software, or maintenance charges are required during the boost period for the base functions of System Recovery Boost.

- -ICA SR 1.1 and ICA SR PCIe fan-out for coupling (two ports per feature)
- /SM590000 Management elements: Two dual function base management controllers (BMC) and oscillator cards (OSC) for system control and to provide system clock (N+1 redundancy).
- /SM590000 CPC drawer power infrastructure consists of the following components:
- -Three or four Power Supply Units (PSUs) that provide power to the CPC drawer. The loss of one power supply leaves enough power to satisfy the drawer's power requirements (N+1 redundancy). The power supplies can be concurrently removed and replaced individually.
- -5x 12v distribution point-of-load (POL) that plug in slots that divide the memory banks.

Memory is connected to the DCMs through memory control units (MCUs). Up to six MCUs are available in a CPC drawer (one or two per DCM) and provide the interface to the DIMM controller. A memory controller uses eight DIMM slots.

The buses are organized in the following configurations:

- /SM590000 The M-bus provides interconnects between PU chips in the same DCM
- /SM590000 The X-bus provides interconnects between PU chips to each other, in the same drawer
- /SM590000 The A-bus provides interconnects between different drawers by using SMP9 cables

The point-to-point SMP9 connection topology for CPC drawers is shown in Figure 2-10. Each CPC drawer communicates directly to all of the other CPC drawers DCMs by using point-to-point links.

The CPC drawers that are installed in Frame A and Frame B are populated from bottom to top.

The order of CPC drawer installation is listed in Table 2-4.

CPC drawer installation in the A frame is concurrent. Non-disruptive addition of CPC1 or CPC2 drawers is possible in the field (MES upgrade) if the reserve features (FC 2981 or FC 2982) are included with the initial system order.

Concurrent drawer repair requires a minimum of two CPC drawers.

Concurrent drawer repair requires a minimum of two CPC drawers.

2.2.2  Oscillator card

With IBM z16 Model A01, the oscillator card design and signal distribution scheme are improved; however, the RAS strategy for redundant clock signal and dynamic switchover is unchanged. One primary OSC card and one backup are used. If the primary OSC card fails, the secondary detects the failure, takes over transparently, and continues to provide the clock signal to the CPC.

HMC level 2.16.0 (Driver 51) is required to manage system time for IBM z16 Model A01.

Manage System Time

HMC level 2.16.0 (Driver 51) is required to manage system time for IBM z16 Model A01.

Network Time Protocol

The SEs provide the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client function. When Server Time Protocol (STP) is used, the time of an STP-only Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) can be synchronized to the time that is provided by a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. This configuration allows time-of-day (TOD) synchronization in a heterogeneous platform environment and throughout the LPARs running on the CPC.

Precision Time Protocol

For IBM z16 Model A01, Precision Time Protocol (PTP, IEEE 1588) also can be used as an external time source for IBM Z Server Time Protocol (STP) for an IBM Z Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). The initial implementation for PTP connectivity is provided by using the IBM Z Support Element (SE).

l time source for IBM Z Server Time Protocol (STP) for an IBM Z Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). The initial implementation for PTP connectivity is provided by using the IBM Z Support Element (SE).

On IBM z16, the external time source (PTP or NTP) is connected directly to the CPC and bypasses the SE connection. This IBM z16 feature allows more accurate sync with the external time source.

The accuracy of an STP-only CTN is improved by using an NTP or PTP server with the PPS output signal as the External Time Source (ETS). Devices with PPS output are available from several vendors that offer network timing solutions.

2.2.3  System control

The various system elements are managed through the base management cards (BMCs). The BMC is the replacement for the previous Flexible Support Processors (FSPs) that were used in previous systems.

With IBM z16 Model A01, the CPC drawer BMC is combined with the Oscillator card in a single Field Replaceable Unit (FRU). Two combined BMC/OSC cards are used per CPC drawer.

Also, the PCIe+ I/O drawer has an improved BMC. Each BMC card has one Ethernet port that connects to the internal Ethernet LANs through the internal network switches (SW1, SW2, and SW3, SW4, if configured). The BMCs communicate with the SEs and provide a subsystem interface (SSI) for controlling components.

nal Ethernet LANs through the internal network switches (SW1, SW2, and SW3, SW4, if configured). The BMCs communicate with the SEs and provide a subsystem interface (SSI) for controlling components.

An overview of the system control design is shown in Figure 2-12.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: The maximum IBM z16 A01 system configuration features four GbE switches, four CPC drawers, and up to 12 PCIe I/O drawers.

A typical BMC operation is to control a power supply. An SE sends a command to the BMC to start the power supply. The BMC cycles the various components of the power supply, monitors the success of each step and the resulting voltages, and reports this status to the SE.

SEs are duplexed ( N +1), and each element has at least one BMC. Two internal Ethernet LAN switches and two SEs, for redundancy, and crossover connectivity between the LANs, are configured so that both SEs can operate on both LANs.



--- Chunk 1424 ---
h element has at least one BMC. Two internal Ethernet LAN switches and two SEs, for redundancy, and crossover connectivity between the LANs, are configured so that both SEs can operate on both LANs.

The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and SEs are connected directly to one or two Ethernet Customer LANs. One or more HMCs can be used.

With IBM z16 current ordered systems, the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA, FC 0129) is the only HMC-orderable feature. The HMA is running on the same hardware (virtual appliance) with the Support Elements (the SE code runs as a guest of the HMA).

The power for the CPC drawer is a new design. It uses the following combinations of PSUs, Points of Load (POLs), Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs), and Processor Power Control Cards:

- /SM590000 PSUs: Provide AC to 12 V DC bulk or standby power and are installed at the rear of the CPC. The quantity that is installed depends on the following configurations:
- -Three PSUs for configurations that use BPA power
- -Four PSUs for configurations that use PDU power
- /SM590000 POLs: Seven Point of Load N+2 Redundant cards are installed next to the Memory DIMMs.

- /SM590000 VRMs: seven Voltage Regulator Modules (N+2 redundancy).
- /SM590000 Processor Power Control Card (PPC): Redundant processor power and control cards connect to the CPC trail board. The control function is powered from 12 V standby that is provided by the PSU. The PPC card also includes pressure, temperature, and humidity sensors.

2.3  Dual chip modules

The DCM is a multi-layer metal substrate module that holds two PU chips. The PU chip size is 530 mm 2  and has 22.5 billion transistors. Each CPC drawer has four PU DCMs.

The PU DCM is shown in Figure 2-13. The DCM features a thermal cap that is placed over the chips. Each DCM is water-cooled by way of a cold plate manifold assembly.

<!-- missing-text -->

PU chips use 7 nm FinFET process, each DCM socket contains 4753 pins, and the module size is 71.5 mm x 79 mm.

The DCMs are each plugged into a socket that is part of the CPC drawer packaging. Each DCM is cooled by water flowing through a manifold assembly where cold plates are attached and used to help remove the heat from the processor chips.

2.3.3  PU characterization

The PUs are characterized for client use. The characterized PUs can be used in general to run supported operating systems, such as z/OS, z/VM, and Linux on IBM Z. They also can run specific workloads, such as Java, XML services, IPsec, and some Db2 workloads, or clustering functions, such as the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC).

z/VM, and Linux on IBM Z. They also can run specific workloads, such as Java, XML services, IPsec, and some Db2 workloads, or clustering functions, such as the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC).

The maximum number of characterizable PUs depends on the IBM z16 Model A01 CPC drawer feature code. Some PUs are characterized for system use; some are characterized for client workload use.

By default, one spare PU is available to assume the function of a failed PU. The maximum number of PUs that can be characterized for client use are listed in Table 2-5.

The rule for the CP to zIIP purchase ratio, that for every CP purchased, up to two zIIPs can be purchased has been removed on z16.

Converting a PU from one type to any other type is possible by using the Dynamic Processor Unit Reassignment process. These conversions occur concurrently with the system operation.

removed on z16.

Converting a PU from one type to any other type is possible by using the Dynamic Processor Unit Reassignment process. These conversions occur concurrently with the system operation.

Note: The addition of ICFs, IFLs, zIIPs, and SAPs to the IBM z16 Model A01 does not change the system capacity setting or its million service units (MSU) rating.

2.3.4  Cache level structure

The cache structure comparison between CPC drawers on IBM z16 A01 and IBM z15 T01 is shown in Figure 2-16.

- -With IBM z16 Model A01, the numbering of the PCHIDs is not related to a fixed location in a frame as with previous generations of IBM Z. Instead, the first configured I/O location starts with PCHID 100 and continues the incremental sequence to the next configured PCIe I/O drawer.
- For more information about examples of the various configurations, see Appendix E, 'Frame configurations Power Distribution Units and Bulk Power Assembly-based systems' on page 529.

The following configuration examples and how the configurations are different from the power selection (PDU or BPA), number of CPC drawers and I/O features ordered, the layout of the PCIe+ I/O drawers, and PCHID numbering are shown in Figure 2-18:

Consideration for PCHID identification:

In previous PCIe I/O drawers (introduced with zEC12), the orientation of the I/O features were vertical. For IBM z16 Model A01, the orientation of the PCIe features is horizontal. The top of the card is now closest to the center of the drawer for the left and right side of the drawer.

The vertical card collapsed horizontal and the awareness of the port and PCHID layout where the top of the adapter (port D1) is closest to the location panel on both sides of the drawer are shown in Figure 2-19.

2.5  Memory

The maximum physical memory size is directly related to the number of CPC drawers in the system. Each CPC drawer can contain up to 10 TB of customer memory, for a total of 40 TB of memory per system.

Note: IBM z16 with Bulk Power Adapter option can be configured with only 5 TB of memory per CPC drawer (BPA systems maximum memory is 20 TB).

The following memory types are available:

- /SM590000 Purchased: Memory that is available for assignment to LPARs.
- /SM590000 Hardware System Area (HSA): Standard 256 GB of addressable memory for system use outside of customer memory.
- /SM590000 Standard: Provides minimum physical memory that is required to hold customer purchase memory plus 256 GB HSA.
- /SM590000 Flexible: Provides more physical memory that is needed to support that activation of base customer memory and HSA on a multiple CPC drawer IBM z16 with one drawer out of service (concurrent drawer replacement; not available on Max39 feature).

The IBM z16 Model A01 server uses the enhanced RAIM design. Installed Physical Memory (DIMM capacity) in configuration reports is addressable memory size. Memory is protected by RAIM. DIMM size includes RAIM overhead.

Servers are configured with the most efficient configuration of memory DIMMs that can support Addressable Memory that is required for Customer Ordered Memory plus HSA. In some cases, Available Addressable Memory might be available to support one or more concurrent LIC CC Customer Memory upgrades with no DIMM changes.

- /SM590000 A CPC drawer can have available unused memory, which can be ordered as a memory upgrade and enabled by LIC-CC concurrently without DIMM changes.
- /SM590000 DIMM changes require a disruptive power-on reset (POR) on IBM z16 A01 with a single CPC drawer. DIMM changes can be done concurrently on IBM z16 models with multiple CPC drawers using Enhanced Drawer Availability (EDA).
- /SM590000 CFG numbers from 32 to 35 are used on PDU machines only.
- /SM590000 BPA machines have an upper limit of CFG number 31.

DIMM plugging for the configurations in each CPC drawer do not have to be similar. Each memory 8-slot DIMM bank must have the same DIMM size; however, a drawer can have a mix of DIMM banks.

The support element View Hardware Configuration task can be used to determine the size and quantity of the memory plugged in each drawer. Figure 2-21 on page 41 shows an example of configuration number 27 from the previous tables, and displays the location and description of the installed memory modules.

- /SM590000 Dial Max indicates the maximum memory that can be enabled by way of the LICC concurrent upgrade.

If more storage is ordered by using other feature codes, such as Virtual Flash Memory or Flexible Memory, the extra storage is installed and plugged as necessary.

For example, a customer orders FC 2857 that features 9472 GB customer memory and FC 0669 Max125 (3 CPC drawers). The drawer configurations include the following components:

2.5.4  Memory upgrades

Memory upgrades can be ordered and enabled by LIC, upgrading the DIMM cards, adding DIMM cards, or adding a CPC drawer.

For a model upgrade that results in the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum memory increment is added to the system. Each CPC drawer has a minimum physical memory size of 1024 GB.

Memory allowed upgrades for Max200 models

Once a model Max200 is shipped, then the memory upgrades via MES are limited dependent on what configuration exists in the installed CPC drawers.

Once a model Max200 is shipped, then the memory upgrades via MES are limited dependent on what configuration exists in the installed CPC drawers.

- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG numbers 22 to 33 (see Table 2-8 on page 39) then the max memory configuration for that CPC drawer is 33
- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG number 34, then the max memory configuration for that CPC drawer is 34
- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG number 35, then it's maxed out anyway.

awer is plugged with CFG number 34, then the max memory configuration for that CPC drawer is 34
- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG number 35, then it's maxed out anyway.

Model Upgrades

During a model upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation 4 . Adding physical memory to the added drawer is also concurrent. If all or part of the added memory is enabled for use, it might become available to an active LPAR if the partition includes defined reserved storage. (For more information, see 3.7.3, 'Reserved storage' on page 126.) Alternatively, the added memory can be used by a defined LPAR that is activated after the memory is added.

Note: Memory downgrades within an IBM z16 are not supported. Feature downgrades (removal of a CPC quantity feature) are not supported.

2.5.5  Drawer replacement and memory

ter the memory is added.

Note: Memory downgrades within an IBM z16 are not supported. Feature downgrades (removal of a CPC quantity feature) are not supported.

2.5.5  Drawer replacement and memory

With EDA, which is supported for IBM z16 A01, sufficient resources must be available to accommodate resources that are rendered unavailable when a CPC drawer is removed for upgrade or repair.

For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.

Removing a CPC drawer often results in removing active memory. With the flexible memory option, removing the affected memory and reallocating its use elsewhere in the system is possible. (For more information, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.) This process requires more available memory to compensate for the memory that becomes unavailable with the removal of the drawer.

2.5.6  Virtual Flash Memory



--- Chunk 1991 ---
, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.) This process requires more available memory to compensate for the memory that becomes unavailable with the removal of the drawer.

2.5.6  Virtual Flash Memory

IBM Virtual Flash Memory (VFM) FC 0644 offers up to 6.0 TB of virtual flash memory in 512 GB (0.5 TB) increments (a maximum of 12 features for IBM z16 A01) for improved application availability and to handle paging workload spikes.

No application changes are required to change from IBM Flash Express to VFM. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM = total hardware plugged
- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM + Flex memory option = total hardware plugged



--- Chunk 1992 ---
 from IBM Flash Express to VFM. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM = total hardware plugged
- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM + Flex memory option = total hardware plugged

VFM helps improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when z/OS V2.1, V2.2, V2.3, V2.4, or V2.5 is run. With this support, z/OS helps improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM across transitional workload events, such as market openings and diagnostic data collection. z/OS also helps improve processor performance by supporting middleware use of pageable large (1 MB) pages and to help eliminate delays that can occur when collecting diagnostic data.

VFM also can be used by coupling facility images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.



--- Chunk 1993 ---
cur when collecting diagnostic data.

VFM also can be used by coupling facility images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.

VFM can help organizations meet their most demanding service level agreements and compete more effectively. VFM is easy to configure in the LPAR Image Profile and provides rapid time to value.

2.5.7  Flexible Memory Option

With the Flexible Memory Option, more physical memory is supplied to support the activation of the purchased memory entitlement in a single CPC drawer that is out of service during activation (POR), or in a scheduled concurrent drawer upgrade (memory add) or drawer maintenance (n+1 repair) with the use of enhanced drawer availability.

When you order memory, you can request extra flexible memory. The extra physical memory, (if required) is calculated by the configuration and priced accordingly.

se of enhanced drawer availability.

When you order memory, you can request extra flexible memory. The extra physical memory, (if required) is calculated by the configuration and priced accordingly.

The required memory DIMMs are installed before shipping and are based on a target capacity that is specified by the customer. These memory DIMMs are enabled by using a Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) order that is placed by the customer when they determine more memory capacity is needed.

The flexible memory sizes that are available for the IBM z16 A01 are listed in Table 2-10.

2.6  Reliability, availability, and serviceability

IBM Z servers continue to deliver enterprise class RAS with IBM z16. The main philosophy behind RAS is about preventing or tolerating (masking) outages. It is also about providing the necessary instrumentation (in hardware, LIC and microcode, and software) to capture or collect the relevant failure information to help identify an issue without requiring a re-creation of the event. These outages can be planned or unplanned, as shown in the following examples:

- /SM590000 An unplanned outage because of loss of cache coherency
- /SM590000 An unplanned outage because of a firmware problem
- /SM590000 A planned outage for a disruptive firmware upgrade
- /SM590000 A planned outage to add physical memory to a single CPC drawer configuration



--- Chunk 1996 ---
unplanned outage because of a firmware problem
- /SM590000 A planned outage for a disruptive firmware upgrade
- /SM590000 A planned outage to add physical memory to a single CPC drawer configuration

The IBM Z hardware has decades of intense engineering behind it, which results in a robust and reliable platform. The hardware has many RAS features that are built into it.

For more information, see Chapter 9, 'Reliability, availability, and serviceability' on page 379.

System Recovery Boost

With IBM z16, System Recovery Boost feature (first introduced with IBM z15) enables the restoration of service from, and catch up after, planned and unplanned outages faster than on any previous IBM Z with no extra software cost. It also provides faster site switching changeover between systems active in different sites (in a GDPS configured environment).

outages faster than on any previous IBM Z with no extra software cost. It also provides faster site switching changeover between systems active in different sites (in a GDPS configured environment).

Service restoration involves speeding up IPL and shutdown operations of an image (LPAR), and short-duration recovery process boosts for specific sysplex and operating system events. For more information see Introducing IBM Z System Recovery Boost , REDP-5563.

Important: The base System Recovery Boost capability is built into IBM z16 firmware and does not require ordering of extra features. For IBM z16 A01, System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 9930 + FC 6804) is an optional, orderable feature that provides more temporary zIIP capacity for use during boost periods. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 AND FC 6804 are needed only if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.

IBM z16 servers continue to deliver robust server designs through new technologies, hardening innovative and classic redundancy. For more information, see Chapter 9, 'Reliability, availability, and serviceability' on page 379.

2.7  Connectivity

Connections to PCIe+ I/O drawers and Integrated Coupling Adapters are driven from the CPC drawer fan-out cards. These fan-outs are installed in the rear of the CPC drawer.

Figure 2-22 shows the location of the fan-out slots. Each slot is identified with a location code (label) of LGxx.

<!-- missing-text -->

Up to 12 PCIe fan-outs (LG01 - LG12) can be installed in each CPC drawer.

A fan-out can be repaired concurrently with the use of redundant I/O interconnect. For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.

A fan-out can be repaired concurrently with the use of redundant I/O interconnect. For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.

The following types of fan-outs are available:

- /SM590000 PCIe+ Generation 3 dual port fan-out card: This fan-out provides connectivity to the PCIe switch cards in the PCIe+ I/O drawer.
- /SM590000 Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR1.1 and ICA SR): These adapters provide coupling connectivity to IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 servers.

- /SM590000 One, two, or three pairs of redundant SMP9 connectors provide connectivity to the other one, two, or three CPC drawers in the configuration.

ty to IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 servers.

- /SM590000 One, two, or three pairs of redundant SMP9 connectors provide connectivity to the other one, two, or three CPC drawers in the configuration.

When configured for availability, the channels and coupling links are balanced across CPC drawers. In a system that is configured for maximum availability, alternative paths maintain access to critical I/O devices, such as disks and networks. The CHPID Mapping Tool can be used to assist with configuring a system for high availability.

mum availability, alternative paths maintain access to critical I/O devices, such as disks and networks. The CHPID Mapping Tool can be used to assist with configuring a system for high availability.

EDA allows a single CPC drawer in a multidrawer CPC to be removed and reinstalled (serviced) concurrently for an upgrade or a repair. Removing a CPC drawer means that the connectivity to the I/O devices that are connected to that CPC drawer is lost. To prevent connectivity loss, the redundant I/O interconnect feature allows you to maintain connection to critical I/O devices installed in PCIe+I/O Drawers when a CPC drawer is removed. ICA SR1.1 (and ICA SR) can also be installed for coupling and timing links redundancy.

Redundancy is provided for PCIe I/O interconnects.

The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports up to 16 PCIe features, which are organized in two hardware domains (for each drawer). The infrastructure for the fan-out to I/O drawers and external coupling is shown in Figure 2-23.

The PCIe switch card spreads the x16 PCIe bus to the PCIe I/O slots in the domain.

In the PCIe+ I/O drawer, the two PCIe switch cards (LG06 and LG16, see Figure 2-24) provide a backup path (Redundant I/O Interconnect [RII]) for each other through the passive connection in the PCIe+ I/O drawer backplane.

<!-- missing-text -->

During a CPC Drawer PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out or cable failure, all 16 PCIe cards in the two domains can be driven through a single PCIe switch card (see Figure 2-25).

<!-- missing-text -->

To support RII between domain pair 0 and 1, the two interconnects to each pair must be driven from two different PCIe fan-outs. Normally, each PCIe interconnect in a pair supports the eight features in its domain. In backup operation mode, one PCIe interconnect supports all 16 features in the domain pair.

rent PCIe fan-outs. Normally, each PCIe interconnect in a pair supports the eight features in its domain. In backup operation mode, one PCIe interconnect supports all 16 features in the domain pair.

Note: The PCIe Interconnect (switch) adapter must be installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer to maintain the interconnect across I/O domains. If the adapter is removed (for a service operation), the I/O cards in that domain (up to eight) become unavailable.

2.7.2  Enhanced drawer availability

With EDA, the effect of CPC drawer replacement is minimized. In a multiple CPC drawer system, a single CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for an upgrade or repair. Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer.



--- Chunk 2277 ---
ingle CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for an upgrade or repair. Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer.

Before removing the CPC drawer, the contents of the PUs and memory of the drawer must be relocated. PUs must be available on the remaining CPC drawers to replace the deactivated drawer. Also, sufficient redundant memory must be available if no degradation of applications is allowed.

To ensure that the CPC configuration supports removal of a CPC drawer with minimal effect on the workload, consider the flexible memory option. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA.



--- Chunk 2278 ---
orts removal of a CPC drawer with minimal effect on the workload, consider the flexible memory option. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA.

Removal of a CPC drawer also removes the CPC drawer connectivity to the PCIe I/O drawers, and coupling links. The effect of the removal of the CPC drawer on the system is limited by the use of redundant I/O interconnect. (For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.) However, all ICA SR1.1 links that are installed in the removed CPC drawer must be configured offline.

If the enhanced drawer availability and flexible memory options are not used when a CPC drawer must be replaced, the memory in the failing drawer also is removed. This process might be necessary during an upgrade or a repair action.



--- Chunk 2279 ---
y and flexible memory options are not used when a CPC drawer must be replaced, the memory in the failing drawer also is removed. This process might be necessary during an upgrade or a repair action.

Until the removed CPC drawer is replaced, a power-on reset of the system with the remaining CPC drawers is supported. The CPC drawer then can be replaced and added back into the configuration concurrently.

2.7.3  CPC drawer upgrade

All fan-outs that are used for I/O and coupling links are rebalanced concurrently as part of a CPC drawer addition to support better RAS characteristics.

2.8.1  Upgrades

Concurrent upgrades of CPs, IFLs, ICFs, zIIPs, or SAPs are available for the IBM z16. However, concurrent PU upgrades require that more PUs are installed but not activated.

Spare PUs are used to replace defective PUs. Two spare PUs always are on an IBM z16 A01 server. In the rare event of a PU failure, a spare PU is activated concurrently and transparently and is assigned the characteristics of the failing PU.

2.8.2  Model capacity identifier

To recognize how many PUs are characterized as CPs, the Store System Information (STSI) instruction returns a Model Capacity Identifier (MCI). The MCI determines the number and speed of characterized CPs.

Characterization of a PU as an IFL, ICF, or zIIP is not reflected in the output of the STSI instruction because characterization has no effect on software charging. For more information about STSI output, see 'Processor identification' on page 374.

The following distinct model capacity identifier ranges are recognized (one for full capacity and three for granular capacity):

These three subcapacity settings are applied to up to 39 CPs, which combined offer 117 more capacity settings, as described next.

Granular capacity

The IBM z16 A01 server offers 117 capacity settings (granular capacity) for up to 39 CPs. When subcapacity settings are used, PUs beyond 39 can be characterized only as specialty engines. For models with more that 39 CPs, all CPs are running at full capacity (7xx).

2.9.1  PDU-based configurations

The IBM Z operate with redundant power infrastructure. The IBM z16 A01 is designed with a new power infrastructure that is based on intelligent PDUs that are mounted vertically on the rear side of the 19-inch racks and Power Supply Units for the internal components. The PDU configuration supports radiator-cooled systems only.

The PDUs are controlled by using an Ethernet port and support the following input:

- /SM590000 3-phase 200 - 240 V AC (4-wire 'Delta')
- /SM590000 3-phase 380 - 415 V AC (5-wire 'Wye')

The power supply units convert the AC power to DC power that is used as input for the Point of Loads (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers.



--- Chunk 2465 ---
590000 3-phase 380 - 415 V AC (5-wire 'Wye')

The power supply units convert the AC power to DC power that is used as input for the Point of Loads (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers.

The power requirements depend on the number of CPC drawers (1 - 4), number of PCIe I/O drawers (0 - 12) and I/O features that are installed in the PCIe I/O drawers.

PDUs are installed and serviced from the rear of the frame. Unused power ports never should be used by any external device.

A schematic view of a maximum that is configured system with PDU-based power is shown in Figure 2-27.

<!-- missing-text -->

Each PDU installed requires a customer-supplied power feed. The number of power cords that are required depends on the system configuration.

Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully.



--- Chunk 2466 ---
 The number of power cords that are required depends on the system configuration.

Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully.

PDUs are installed in pairs. A system can have 2, 4, 6, or 8 PDUs, depending on the configuration. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Paired PDUs are A1/A2, A3/A4, B1/B2, and C1/C2.
- /SM590000 From the rear of the system, the odd-numbered PDUs are on the left side of the rack; the even-numbered PDUs are on the right side of the rack.
- /SM590000 The total loss of one PDU in a pair does not affect the system operation.

Components that plug into the PDUs for redundancy (by using two power cords) include the following features:

- /SM590000 CPC Drawers, PCIe+ I/O drawers, Radiators, and Support Elements
- /SM590000 The redundancy for each component is achieved by plugging the power cables into the paired PDUs.

ng features:

- /SM590000 CPC Drawers, PCIe+ I/O drawers, Radiators, and Support Elements
- /SM590000 The redundancy for each component is achieved by plugging the power cables into the paired PDUs.

For example, the top Support Element (1), has one power supply plugged into PDU A1 and the second power supply plugged into the paired PDU A2 for redundancy.

Note: Customer power sources should always maintain redundancy across PDU pairs; that is, one power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A1 and the separate power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A2.

As a best practice, connect the odd-numbered PDUs (A1, B1, C1, and D1) to one power source or distribution panel, and the even-numbered PDUs (A2, B2, C2, and D2) to a separate power source or distribution panel.

2.9.2  Bulk Power Assembly-based configurations

The BPA configuration is the feature that allows customers to have truly redundant power cords with phase loss protection. Characteristics are similar to previous IBM Z, but BPA was redesigned to fit into the 19-inch frame.

No PDUs are installed in this configuration; instead, 1 or 2 pairs of BPAs are installed that house the bulk power distribution to all the components, and the Bulk Power Regulators (BPR).

With BPA-based configurations, 3-phase balanced power feature is supported. BPA-based systems support radiator-cooled systems.

The BPAs support 2- or 4-line cords with a single universal type of 3-phase 200 - 480 V AC.

The power supply units convert the regulated high-voltage DC power (supplied by BPA) to DC power that is used as input for the Points of Load (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers.

The power requirements depend on the number of CPC drawers (1 -4), number of PCIe I/O drawers (0 - 10), and I/O features that are installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawers.

A schematic view of a maximum configured system with BPA power is shown in Figure 2-28.

- /SM590000 From the rear of the system, the odd-numbered BPAs are above the even-numbered BPAs in both frames.

The power estimation tool for the IBM z16 allows you to enter your precise server configuration to obtain an estimate of power consumption by using the following process:

- 1. Log in to the Resource link with your user ID.
- 2. Click Planning → Tools → Power Estimation Tools .
- 3. Specify the quantity for the features that are installed in your system.

This tool estimates the power consumption for the specified configuration. The tool does not verify that the specified configuration can be physically built.

Tip: The exact power consumption for your system varies. The object of the tool is to estimate the power requirements to aid you in planning for your system installation. Actual power consumption after installation can be confirmed by using the HMC Monitors Dashboard task.

2.9.4  Cooling

The PU DCMs for IBM z16 A01 are cooled by a cold plate that is connected to the internal water-cooling loop. In an air-cooled system, the radiator unit dissipates the heat from the internal water loop with air. The radiator unit provides improved availability with N+ 1 pumps and blowers.

For all IBM z16 A01 servers, the CPC drawer components (except for PU DCMs) and the PCIe+ I/O drawers are air cooled by redundant fans. Airflow of the system is directed from front (cool air) to the back of the system (hot air).

The IBM z16 A01 PU DCMs in the CPC drawers are cooled by closed loop water. The internal closed water loop removes heat from PU DCMs by circulating water between the radiator heat exchanger and the cold plate that is mounted on the PU DCMs.

For more information, see 2.9.5, 'Radiator Cooling Unit' on page 64.

Although the PU DCMs are cooled by water, the heat is exhausted into the room from the radiator heat exchanger by forced air with blowers. At the system level, these IBM z16 A01 are still air-cooled systems.

r, the heat is exhausted into the room from the radiator heat exchanger by forced air with blowers. At the system level, these IBM z16 A01 are still air-cooled systems.

2.9.5  Radiator Cooling Unit

A total of 1 - 2 Radiator Cooling Units (RCUs) are used in the system: One in Frame A and one in Frame B in support of water cooling of the PU DCMs within the CPC drawers. The unit includes N+1 pumps and N+1 fans. Water loops to each drawer are directly delivered by way of hoses to each drawer from manifolds.

The RCU discharges heat from the internal frame water loop to the customer's data center.

Each RCU provides cooling to PU DCMs with closed loop water within the respective frame. No connection to an external chilled water supply is required. For the IBM z16 A01 server, the internal circulating water is conditioned water (BTA) that is added to the radiator unit during system installation with the Fill and Drain Tool (FC 3393).

M z16 A01 server, the internal circulating water is conditioned water (BTA) that is added to the radiator unit during system installation with the Fill and Drain Tool (FC 3393).

Fill and Drain Tool

The Fill and Drain Tool (FDT) is a new design and is included with new IBM z16 servers. The FDT (FC 3393) is not compatible with IBM z14 and previous systems. The FDT is used to provide the internal water at the installation and for maintenance, and to remove it at discontinuance.

The new design uses a pump for filling the system and FRUs, and a compressor for draining FRUs and discontinuance. The process is faster and more effective. The FDT is shown in Figure 2-29.

<!-- missing-text -->

The RCU contains two independent pump FRUs. Because the cooling capability is a redundant N+1 design, a single working pump and blower can support the entire load. The replacement of one pump or blower can be done concurrently and does not affect performance.

ng capability is a redundant N+1 design, a single working pump and blower can support the entire load. The replacement of one pump or blower can be done concurrently and does not affect performance.

Each RCU contains up to four independent fan assemblies that can be concurrently serviced. The number of fans present depends on the number of CPC drawers that are installed in the frame.

The water pumps, manifold assembly, radiator assembly (which includes the heat exchanger), and fan assemblies are the main components of the IBM z16 RCU, as shown in Figure 2-30.

The closed water loop in the radiator unit is shown in Figure 2-31. The warm water that is exiting from the PU DCMs cold plates enters pumps through a common manifold and is pumped through a heat exchanger where heat is extracted by the air flowing across the heat exchanger fins. The cooled water is then recirculated back into the PU DCMs cold plates.

3.3  CPC drawer design

An IBM z16 A01 system can have up to four CPC drawers in a full configuration, with up to 200 PUs that can be characterized for customer use, and up to 40 TB of customer usable memory.

rawer design

An IBM z16 A01 system can have up to four CPC drawers in a full configuration, with up to 200 PUs that can be characterized for customer use, and up to 40 TB of customer usable memory.

Note: An IBM z16 server with Bulk Power Assembly (BPA) power option is limited to 5 TB per processor drawer (up to 20 TB maximum in a full configuration with four CPC drawers).

The following types of CPC drawer configurations are available for IBM z16 A01:

- /SM590000 One drawer: Max39
- /SM590000 Two drawers: Max82
- /SM590000 Three drawers: Max125
- /SM590000 Four drawers: Max168
- /SM590000 Four drawers: Max200

Note: Max168 and Max200 are factory-build only. It is not possible to upgrade in the field to Max168 or Max200.

The IBM z16 A01 has up to 24 memory controller units (MCUs) for a Max200 feature (one MCU per PU chip, and up to six MCUs populated per CPC drawer). The MCU configuration uses eight channels Reed-Solomon redundant array of independent memory (RAIM).



--- Chunk 2737 ---
s (MCUs) for a Max200 feature (one MCU per PU chip, and up to six MCUs populated per CPC drawer). The MCU configuration uses eight channels Reed-Solomon redundant array of independent memory (RAIM).

The RAIM design is new compared to the IBM z15 T01, moving from a 4+1 DIMM structure that is based on 5-channel RAIM design on IBM z15 to an 8-channel R-S RAIM design on the IBM z16. The new memory architecture provides approximately 15% DRAM reduction for a similar RAS, but a higher memory bandwidth at drawer level.

The DIMM sizes (32, 64, 128, or 256 GB) include RAIM overhead. An IBM z16 CPC drawer can have up to 48 memory DDR4 DIMMs (populated with 32, 40, or 48 DIMMs).

The IBM z16 microprocessor chip (called IBM Telum) integrates a new cache hierarchy design with only two levels of physical cache (L1 and L2). The cache hierarchy (L1, L2) is implemented with dense static random access memory (SRAM).

lled IBM Telum) integrates a new cache hierarchy design with only two levels of physical cache (L1 and L2). The cache hierarchy (L1, L2) is implemented with dense static random access memory (SRAM).

Unlike the IBM z15, eDRAM is no longer used in the IBM Telum processor. On an IBM z16, L2 cache (32 MB) is semi-private with 16 MB dedicated to the associated core, and 16 MB shared with the system (the 50/50 split is adjustable). Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) caches are now virtual caches and are allocated on L2.

Two processor chips (up to eight active cores per PU chip) are combined in a Dual Chip Module (DCM) and four DCMs are assembled in a CPC drawer (eight PU chips). An IBM z16 can have from one CPC drawer (Max39) up to four (Max200).

IBM z16 processors use 7 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography chip technology with advanced low latency pipeline design, which creates high-speed yet power-efficient circuit designs. The PU DCM has a dense packaging, which allows closed water loop cooling. The heat from the closed loop is dissipated into the air by a radiator unit (RU).

The external water-cooling option is no longer available on the IBM z16. For more information, see 2.9, 'Power and cooling' on page 59.

3.3.1  Cache levels and memory structure

The IBM z16 includes a new optimized memory subsystem design that focuses on keeping data 'closer' to the PU core. With the current processor configuration, all on-chip cache levels increased.

On IBM z16, L1 and L2 caches are implemented on the PU chip, and L3 and L4 caches are now implemented as virtual caches and dynamically allocated on the shared part of the L2 semi-private cache.

The cache structure of the IBM z16 features the following characteristics:

L4 caches are now implemented as virtual caches and dynamically allocated on the shared part of the L2 semi-private cache.

The cache structure of the IBM z16 features the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 Large L1, L2 caches (more data closer to the core).
- /SM590000 L1 cache is implemented by using SRAM technology and has the same size than on IBM z15 (128 KB for instructions and 128 KB for data).
- /SM590000 L2 cache (32 MB in total) uses SRAM technology, and is semi-private to each PU core with 16 MB dedicated to the associated core, and 16 MB shared with the system (the 50/50 split is adjustable).
- /SM590000 L3 cache (up to 256 LB) now becomes a virtual cache and can be allocated on any of the share part of a L2 cache.
- /SM590000 L4 cache (up to 2048 MB) is also a virtual cache and can be allocated on any of the share part of a L2 cache.

Main storage has up to 10 TB addressable memory per CPC drawer, which uses up to 48 DDR4 DIMMs. A system with four CPC drawers can have up to 40 TB of main storage.

Considerations

Cache sizes are limited by ever-diminishing cycle times because they must respond quickly without creating bottlenecks. Access to large caches costs more cycles. Instruction and data cache (L1) sizes must be limited because larger distances must be traveled to reach long cache lines. This L1 access time generally occurs in one cycle, which prevents increased latency.



--- Chunk 2743 ---
on and data cache (L1) sizes must be limited because larger distances must be traveled to reach long cache lines. This L1 access time generally occurs in one cycle, which prevents increased latency.

Also, the distance to remote caches as seen from the microprocessor becomes a significant factor. For example, on an IBM z15 server, access to L4 physical cache (on the SC chip and which might not even be in the same CPC drawer) requires several cycles to travel the distance to the cache. On an IBM z16, having an L4 virtual, physically allocated on the shared L2 requires fewer processor cycles in many instances.

Although large caches mean increased access latency, the new technology 7 nm EUV chip lithography and the lower cycle time allows IBM z16 servers to increase the size of L2 cache level within the PU chip.



--- Chunk 2744 ---
gh large caches mean increased access latency, the new technology 7 nm EUV chip lithography and the lower cycle time allows IBM z16 servers to increase the size of L2 cache level within the PU chip.

To overcome the inherent delays of the SMP CPC drawer design and save cycles to access the remote virtual L4 content, the system keeps instructions and data as close to the processors as possible. This configuration can be managed by directing as much work of a specific LPAR workload to the processors in the same CPC drawer as the L4 virtual cache.

This configuration is achieved by having the IBM Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM) scheduler and the z/OS WLM and dispatcher work together. Have them keep as much work as possible within the boundaries of as few processors and L4 virtual cache space (which is best within a CPC drawer boundary) without affecting throughput and response times.

The cache structures of IBM z16 A01 systems are compared with the previous generation of IBM Z (IBM z15 T01) in Figure 3-5.

<!-- missing-text -->

Compared to IBM z15, the IBM z16 cache design has larger L2 cache size. Cache L3 and L4 are now virtual caches in the IBM z16. More affinity exists between the memory of a partition, the L4 virtual cache in a drawer, and the cores in the PU chips. As in IBM z15, the IBM z16 cache level structure is focused on keeping more data closer to the PU. This design can improve system performance on many production workloads.

HiperDispatch

To help avoid latency in a high-frequency processor design, PR/SM and the dispatcher must be prevented from scheduling and dispatching a workload on any processor available, which keeps the workload in as small a portion of the system as possible. The cooperation between z/OS and PR/SM is bundled in a function that is called HiperDispatch . HiperDispatch uses the IBM z16 cache topology, which features reduced cross-cluster 'help' and better locality for multi-task address spaces.

PR/SM can use dynamic PU reassignment to move processors (CPs, ZIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and spares) to a different chip and drawer to improve the reuse of shared caches by processors of the same partition. It can use dynamic memory relocation (DMR) to move a running partition's memory to different physical memory to improve the affinity and reduce the distance between the memory of a partition and the processors of the partition.

3.3.2  CPC drawer interconnect topology

CPC drawers are interconnected in a point-to-point topology that allows a CPC drawer to communicate with every CPC drawer. Data transfer does not always have to go through another CPC drawer to address the requested data or control information.

The IBM z16 A01 inter-CPC drawer communication structure is shown in Figure 3-6.

A simplified topology of a four-CPC drawer system is shown in Figure 3-7.

Inter-CPC drawer communication occurs at the Level 4 virtual cache level, which is implemented on the semi-private part of one of the Level 2 caches in a chip module. The Level 4 cache function regulates coherent drawer-to-drawer traffic.

3.4  Processor unit design

Processor cycle time is especially important for processor-intensive applications. Current systems design is driven by processor cycle time, although improved cycle time does not automatically mean that the performance characteristics of the system improve.

IBM z16 A01 core frequency is 5.2 GHz (same as IBM z15 T01), but with increased number of processors that share larger caches to have shorter access times and improved capacity and performance.

3.4.1  Simultaneous multithreading

Aligned with industry directions, IBM z16 servers can process up to two simultaneous threads in a single core while sharing certain resources of the processor, such as execution units, translation lookaside buffers (TLBs), and caches. When one thread in the core is waiting for other hardware resources, the second thread in the core can use the shared resources rather than remaining idle. This capability is known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT).



--- Chunk 2755 ---
he core is waiting for other hardware resources, the second thread in the core can use the shared resources rather than remaining idle. This capability is known as simultaneous multithreading (SMT).

An operating system with SMT support can be configured to dispatch work to a thread on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM and Linux on IBM Z) core in single thread or SMT mode so that HiperDispatch cache optimization can be considered. For more information about operating system support, see Chapter 7, 'Operating system support' on page 247.

SMT technology allows instructions from more than one thread to run in any pipeline stage at a time. SMT can handle up to four pending translations.

apter 7, 'Operating system support' on page 247.

SMT technology allows instructions from more than one thread to run in any pipeline stage at a time. SMT can handle up to four pending translations.

Each thread has its own unique state information, such as Program Status Word (PSW) and registers. The simultaneous threads cannot necessarily run instructions instantly and must at times compete to use certain core resources that are shared between the threads. In some cases, threads can use shared resources that are not experiencing competition.

Two threads (A and B) that are running on the same processor core on different pipeline stages and sharing the core resources is shown in Figure 3-8.

The use of SMT provides more efficient use of the processors' resources and helps address memory latency, which results in overall throughput gains. The active thread shares core resources in space, such as data and instruction caches, TLBs, branch history tables, and, in time, pipeline slots, execution units, and address translators.

Although SMT increases the processing capacity, the performance in some cases might be superior if a single thread is used. Enhanced hardware monitoring supports measurement through CPUMF for thread usage and capacity.

For workloads that need maximum thread speed, the partition's SMT mode can be turned off. For workloads that need more throughput to decrease the dispatch queue size, the partition's SMT mode can be turned on.

SMT use is functionally transparent to middleware and applications, and no changes are required to run them in an SMT-enabled partition.

3.4.2  Single-instruction multiple-data

The IBM z16 superscalar processor has 32 vector registers and an instruction set architecture that includes a subset of instructions (known as SIMD) that were added to improve the efficiency of complex mathematical models and vector processing. These new instructions allow a larger number of operands to be processed with a single instruction. The SIMD instructions use the superscalar core to process operands in parallel.



--- Chunk 2759 ---
vector processing. These new instructions allow a larger number of operands to be processed with a single instruction. The SIMD instructions use the superscalar core to process operands in parallel.

SIMD provides the next phase of enhancements of IBM Z analytics capability. The set of SIMD instructions is a type of data parallel computing and vector processing that can decrease the amount of code and accelerate code that handles integer, string, character, and floating point data types. The SIMD instructions improve performance of complex mathematical models and allow integration of business transactions and analytic workloads on IBM Z servers.

The 32 vector registers feature 128 bits. The instructions include string operations, vector integer, and vector floating point operations. Each register contains multiple data elements of a fixed size. The following instructions code specifies which data format to use and the size of the elements:



--- Chunk 2760 ---
 and vector floating point operations. Each register contains multiple data elements of a fixed size. The following instructions code specifies which data format to use and the size of the elements:

- /SM590000 Byte (16 8-bit operands)
- /SM590000 Halfword (eight 16-bit operands)
- /SM590000 Word (four 32-bit operands)
- /SM590000 Doubleword (two 64-bit operands)
- /SM590000 Quadword (one 128-bit operand)

The collection of elements in a register is called a vector . A single instruction operates on all of the elements in the register. Instructions include a nondestructive operand encoding that allows the addition of the register vector A and register vector B and stores the result in the register vector A (A = A + B).

A schematic representation of a SIMD instruction with 16-byte size elements in each vector operand is shown in Figure 3-9.

A schematic representation of a SIMD instruction with 16-byte size elements in each vector operand is shown in Figure 3-9.

<!-- missing-text -->

The vector register file overlays the floating-point registers (FPRs), as shown in Figure 3-10. The FPRs use the first 64 bits of the first 16 vector registers, which saves hardware area and power, and makes it easier to mix scalar and SIMD codes. Effectively, the core gets 64 FPRs, which can further improve FP code efficiency.

- /SM590000 Integer byte to doubleword min, max, and average

- /SM590000 String find 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit

For most operations, the condition code is not set. A summary condition code is used only for a few instructions.

3.4.3  Out-of-Order execution

IBM z16 servers have an Out-of-Order core, much like the IBM z15 and IBM z14. This optimized Out-of-Order feature yields significant performance benefits for compute-intensive applications. It does so by reordering instruction execution, which allows later (younger) instructions to be run ahead of a stalled instruction, and reordering storage accesses and parallel storage accesses. Out-of-Order maintains good performance growth for traditional applications.

Out-of-Order execution can improve performance in the following ways:

ses. Out-of-Order maintains good performance growth for traditional applications.

Out-of-Order execution can improve performance in the following ways:

- /SM590000 Reordering instruction execution

Instructions stall in a pipeline because they are waiting for results from a previous instruction or the execution resource that they require is busy. In an in-order core, this stalled instruction stalls all later instructions in the code stream. In an out-of-order core, later instructions are allowed to run ahead of the stalled instruction.

- /SM590000 Reordering storage accesses
- Instructions that access storage can stall because they are waiting on results that are needed to compute the storage address. In an in-order core, later instructions are stalled. In an out-of-order core, later storage-accessing instructions that can compute their storage address are allowed to run.

--- Chunk 2764 ---
re, later instructions are stalled. In an out-of-order core, later storage-accessing instructions that can compute their storage address are allowed to run.
- /SM590000 Hiding storage access latency

Many instructions access data from storage. Storage accesses can miss the L1 and require 7 - 50 more clock cycles to retrieve the storage data. In an in-order core, later instructions in the code stream are stalled. In an out-of-order core, later instructions that are not dependent on this storage data are allowed to run.

Program results

The Out-of-Order execution does not change any program results. Execution can occur out of (program) order, but all program dependencies are accepted, and the same results are seen as in-order (program) execution. The design was optimized by increasing the Global Completion Table (GCT) from 48x3 to 60x3, which increased the issue queue size from 2x30 to 2x36 and designed a new Mapper.

This implementation requires special circuitry to make execution and memory accesses display in order to the software. The logical diagram of an IBM z16 core is shown in Figure 3-11 on page 83.

Up to six instructions can be decoded per cycle, and up to 12 instructions or operations can be started to run per clock cycle (0.192 ns). The execution of the instructions can occur out of program order and memory address generation and memory accesses can also occur out of program order.

The IBM z16 superscalar PU core can have up to 10 instructions or operations that are running per cycle. This technology results in shorter workload runtime.

Enhanced branch prediction

If the branch prediction logic of the microprocessor makes the wrong prediction, all instructions in the parallel pipelines are removed. The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible.



--- Chunk 2769 ---
 The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible.

For this reason, various history-based branch prediction mechanisms are used, as shown in the in-order part of the IBM z16 PU core logical diagram in Figure 3-11. The branch target buffer (BTB) runs ahead of instruction cache prefetches to prevent branch misses in an early stage. Furthermore, a branch history table (BHT) offers a high branch prediction success rate in combination with a pattern history table (PHT) and the use of tagged multi-target prediction technology branch prediction.

Branch prediction is now implemented as a two level BTB, BTB1 ('small' and 'fast'), and BTB2 (large, dense-SRAM). Now, BTB1 and BTB2 feature dynamic (variable) capacity:

- -Two table TAGE 4  Pattern History Table (PHT): A two-level table (with different history lengths). Branch direction is predicted based on history.
- -Perceptron: Called a Perceptron because this is a neural network algorithm that learns to correlate branch history over time and predicts direction of branches that the other mechanisms cannot catch with sufficient accuracy

3.4.4  Superscalar processor

A scalar processor is a processor that is based on a single-issue architecture, which means that only a single instruction is run at a time. A superscalar processor allows concurrent (parallel) execution of instructions by adding resources to the microprocessor in multiple pipelines, each working on its own set of instructions to create parallelism.

A superscalar processor is based on a multi-issue architecture. However, when multiple instructions can be run during each cycle, the level of complexity is increased because an operation in one pipeline stage might depend on data in another pipeline stage. Therefore, a superscalar design demands careful consideration of which instruction sequences can successfully operate in a long pipeline environment.

IBM z16 is a superscalar processor. Each processor unit, or core, is a superscalar and out-of-order processor that supports 10 concurrent issues to execution units in a single CPU cycle:

- /SM590000 Fixed-point unit (FXU): The FXU handles fixed-point arithmetic.
- /SM590000 Load-store unit (LSU): The LSU contains the data cache. It is responsible for handling all types of operand accesses of all lengths, modes, and formats as defined in the z/Architecture.

IBM integrated Accelerator for zEDC (on-chip)

Introduced in IBM z15, the On-Chip data compression accelerator (Nest Accelerator Unit NXU, see Figure 3-12 on page 86) provides real value for existing and new data compression use cases.

IBM z16 Compression/Decompression accelerator is implemented in the Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU) on each processor chip of the IBM Telum microprocessor. IBM z16 On-Chip Compression delivers industry-leading throughput and replaces the zEDC Express PCIe adapter available on the IBM z14 and earlier servers.

One Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU) is used per processor chip, which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Brand new concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest
- /SM590000 Supports DEFLATE compliant compression/decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler
- /SM590000 Low latency

- /SM590000 Problem state execution
- /SM590000 Hardware/Firmware interlocks to ensure system responsiveness
- /SM590000 Designed instruction
- /SM590000 Run in millicode

The On-Chip Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processors chip; therefore, it is available to all LPARs and guests.

n in millicode

The On-Chip Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processors chip; therefore, it is available to all LPARs and guests.

Moving the compression function from the I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly on L2 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O.

Data compression is running in one of the two execution modes available: Synchronous mode or Asynchronous mode:

- /SM590000 Synchronous execution occurs in problem states where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space.
- /SM590000 Asynchronous execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM/QSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution.

Asynchronous execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for existing authorized users of zEDC.

IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort (on-core)

Sorting data is a significant part of IBM Z workloads including batch workloads, database query processing, and utility processing. The amount of data that is stored and processed on IBM Z continues to grow at a high rate, which drives an ever-increasing sort workload.

orkloads, database query processing, and utility processing. The amount of data that is stored and processed on IBM Z continues to grow at a high rate, which drives an ever-increasing sort workload.

Introduced on IBM z15 was the sort accelerator that is known as the IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort (see Figure 3-13 on page 87). The SORTL hardware instruction that is implemented on each core is used by DFSORT and the Db2 utilities for z/OS Suite to allow the use of a hardware-accelerated approach to sorting.

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort feature termed as 'ZSORT' helps to reduce the CPU costs and improve the elapsed time for eligible workloads. One of the primary requirements for ZSORT is providing enough virtual, real, and auxiliary storage.

Sort jobs that run in memory-constrained environments in which the amount of memory that is available to be used by DFSORT jobs is restricted might not achieve optimal performance results or might not be able to use ZSORT.



--- Chunk 2784 ---
mory-constrained environments in which the amount of memory that is available to be used by DFSORT jobs is restricted might not achieve optimal performance results or might not be able to use ZSORT.

The 64-bit memory objects (above-the-bar-storage) can use the ZSORT accelerator for sort workloads for optimal results. Because ZSORT is part of the CPU and memory latency is much less than disk latency, sorting in memory is more efficient than sorting with memory and disk workspace. By allowing ZSORT to process the input completely in memory, it can achieve the best results in elapsed time and CPU time.

Because the goal of ZSORT is to reduce CPU time and elapsed time, it can require more storage than a DFSORT application that does not use ZSORT.

Note: Not all sorts are eligible to use ZSORT. IBM's zBNA tool provides modeling support for identifying potential ZSORT-eligible candidate jobs and estimates the benefits of ZSORT. The tool uses information in the SMF type 16 records.

3.4.7  Decimal floating point accelerator

The decimal floating point (DFP) accelerator function is on each of the microprocessors (cores) on the 8-core chip. Its implementation meets business application requirements for better performance, precision, and function.

Base 10 arithmetic is used for most business and financial computation. Floating point computation that is used for work that is typically done in decimal arithmetic involves frequent data conversions and approximation to represent decimal numbers. This process makes floating point arithmetic complex and error-prone for programmers who use it for applications in which the data is typically decimal.

Hardware DFP computational instructions provide the following features:

- /SM590000 Packed data is operated in memory by all decimal instructions without general-purpose registers, which were required only to prepare for decimal floating point packed conversion instruction.
- /SM590000 Converting from packed can now force the input packed value to positive instead of requiring a separate OI, OILL, or load positive instruction.
- /SM590000 Converting to packed can now force a positive zero result instead of requiring ZAP instruction.

3.4.8  IEEE floating point

Binary and hexadecimal floating-point instructions are implemented in IBM z16 servers. They incorporate IEEE standards into the system.

The IBM z16 core implements two other execution subunits for 2x throughput on BFP (single/double precision) operations (see Figure 3-11 on page 83).

They incorporate IEEE standards into the system.

The IBM z16 core implements two other execution subunits for 2x throughput on BFP (single/double precision) operations (see Figure 3-11 on page 83).

The key point is that Java and C/C++ applications tend to use IEEE BFP operations more frequently than earlier applications. Therefore, the better the hardware implementation of this set of instructions, the better the performance of applications.

3.4.9  Processor error detection and recovery

The PU uses a process called transient recovery as an error recovery mechanism. When an error is detected, the instruction unit tries the instruction the instruction again, and attempts to recover the error. If the second attempt is unsuccessful (that is, a permanent fault exists), a relocation process is started that restores the full capacity by moving work to another PU.

Relocation under hardware control is possible because the R-unit has the full designed state in its buffer. PU error detection and recovery are shown in Figure 3-17.

3.4.10  Branch prediction

Because of the ultra-high frequency of the PUs, the penalty for a wrongly predicted branch is high. Therefore, a multi-pronged strategy for branch prediction is implemented on each core based on gathered branch history that is combined with other prediction mechanisms.

The BHT (Branch History Table) implementation on processors provides a large performance improvement. Originally introduced on the IBM ES/9000 9021 in 1990, the BHT is continuously improved.

The BHT (Branch History Table) implementation on processors provides a large performance improvement. Originally introduced on the IBM ES/9000 9021 in 1990, the BHT is continuously improved.

It offers significant branch performance benefits. The BHT allows each PU to take instruction branches that are based on a stored BHT, which improves processing times for calculation routines.

In addition to the BHT, IBM z16 servers use the following techniques to improve the prediction of the correct branch to be run:

- /SM590000 BTB
- /SM590000 PHT
- /SM590000 CTB

The success rate of branch prediction contributes significantly to the superscalar aspects of IBM z16 processor. This success is because the architecture rules prescribe that the correctly predicted result of the branch is essential for successful parallel execution of an instruction stream.

IBM z16 integrates a new branch prediction design that uses SRAM and supports the following enhancements over IBM z15:

- /SM590000 TAGE PHT: 4 k x 2
- /SM590000 TAGE CTB: 1 k x 2

3.4.11  Wild branch

When a bad pointer is used or when code overlays a data area that contains a pointer to code, a random branch is the result. This process causes a 0C1 or 0C4 abend. Random branches are difficult to diagnose because clues about how the system got to that point are not evident.

With the wild branch hardware facility, the last address from which a successful branch instruction was run is kept. z/OS uses this information with debugging aids, such as the SLIP command, to determine from where a wild branch came.

ty, the last address from which a successful branch instruction was run is kept. z/OS uses this information with debugging aids, such as the SLIP command, to determine from where a wild branch came.

It also can collect data from that storage location. This approach decreases the number of debugging steps that are necessary when you want to know from where the branch came.

3.4.12  Translation lookaside buffer

The TLB in the instruction and data L1 caches use a secondary TLB to enhance performance.

The size of the TLB is kept as small as possible because of its short access time requirements and hardware space limitations. Because memory sizes recently increased significantly as a result of the introduction of 64-bit addressing, a smaller working set is represented by the TLB.

uirements and hardware space limitations. Because memory sizes recently increased significantly as a result of the introduction of 64-bit addressing, a smaller working set is represented by the TLB.

To increase the working set representation in the TLB without enlarging the TLB, large (1 MB) page and giant page (2 GB) support is available and can be used when suitable. For more information, see 'Large page support' on page 114.

With the enhanced DAT-2 (EDAT-2) improvements, the IBM Z servers support 2 GB page frames.

IBM z16 TLB

IBM z16 switches to a logical-tagged L1 directory and inline TLB2. Each L1 cache directory entry contains the virtual address and Address Space Control Element (ASCE) because it no longer must access TLB for L1 cache hit. TLB2 is accessed in parallel to L2, which saves significant latency compared to TLB1-miss.

The new translation engine allows up to four translations pending concurrently. Each translation step is ~2x faster, which helps second level guests.

3.4.13  Instruction fetching, decoding, and grouping

The superscalar design of the microprocessor allows for the decoding of up to six instructions per cycle and the execution of up to 12 instructions per cycle. Both execution and storage accesses for instruction and operand fetching can occur out of sequence.

Instruction fetching



--- Chunk 2851 ---
instructions per cycle and the execution of up to 12 instructions per cycle. Both execution and storage accesses for instruction and operand fetching can occur out of sequence.

Instruction fetching

Instruction fetching normally tries to get as far ahead of instruction decoding and execution as possible because of the relatively large instruction buffers that are available. In the microprocessor, smaller instruction buffers are used. The operation code is fetched from the I-cache and put in instruction buffers that hold prefetched data that is awaiting decoding.

Instruction decoding

The processor can decode up to six instructions per cycle. The result of the decoding process is queued and later used to form a group.

Instruction grouping

From the instruction queue, up to 12 instructions can be completed on every cycle. A complete description of the rules is beyond the scope of this publication.

The Transactional Execution (TX) capability, which is known in the industry as hardware transactional memory , runs a group of instructions atomically; that is, all of their results are committed or no result is committed. The execution is optimistic. The instructions are run, but previous state values are saved in a transactional memory. If the transaction succeeds, the saved values are discarded; otherwise, they are used to restore the original values.

The Transaction Execution Facility provides instructions, including declaring the beginning and end of a transaction, and canceling the transaction. TX is expected to provide significant performance benefits and scalability by avoiding most locks. This benefit is especially important for heavily threaded applications, such as Java.

Runtime Instrumentation (RI) is a hardware facility for managed run times, such as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). RI allows dynamic optimization of code generation as it is being run. It requires fewer system resources than the current software-only profiling, and provides information about hardware and program characteristics. RI also enhances JRE in making the correct decision by providing real-time feedback.

3.5  Processor unit functions

The PU functions are described in this section.

3.5.1  Overview

All PUs on an IBM z16 are physically identical. When the system is initialized, two integrated firmware processors (IFP) are allocated from the pool of PUs that is available for the entire system. The other PUs can be characterized to specific functions (CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, or SAP).

The function that is assigned to a PU is set by the Licensed Internal Code (LIC). The LIC is loaded when the system is initialized at power-on reset (POR) and the PUs are characterized .

Only characterized PUs include a designated function. Non-characterized PUs are considered spares. You must order at least one CP, IFL, or ICF on an IBM z16.



--- Chunk 2859 ---
t (POR) and the PUs are characterized .

Only characterized PUs include a designated function. Non-characterized PUs are considered spares. You must order at least one CP, IFL, or ICF on an IBM z16.

This design brings outstanding flexibility to IBM z16 servers because any PU can assume any available characterization. The design also plays an essential role in system availability because PU characterization can be done dynamically, with no system outage.

For more information about software level support of functions and features, see Chapter 7, 'Operating system support' on page 247.

Concurrent upgrades

For all IBM z16 A01 features that have more processor units (PUs) installed (non-characterized) than activated, concurrent upgrades can be done by using LIC activation. This activation assigns a PU function to a previously non-characterized PU. No hardware changes are required.

The upgrade can be done concurrently through the following facilities:

 LIC activation. This activation assigns a PU function to a previously non-characterized PU. No hardware changes are required.

The upgrade can be done concurrently through the following facilities:

- /SM590000 Customer Initiated Upgrade (CIU) for permanent upgrades
- /SM590000 On/Off Capacity on Demand (On/Off CoD) for temporary upgrades
- /SM590000 Capacity BackUp (CBU) for temporary upgrades
- /SM590000 Capacity for Planned Event (CPE) for temporary upgrades (available only if the CPE feature code was carried forward from a previous IBM z14 or IBM z15 machine)

If the PU chips in the installed CPC drawers have no available remaining PUs, an upgrade results in a feature upgrade and the installation of an extra CPC drawer. Field add (MES) of a CPC drawer is possible for IBM z16 Model A01 features Max39 and Max82 only. These features can be upgraded to a Max125 provided initial order for the CPC Reserve features FC 2981 or FC 2982. CPC drawer installation is nondisruptive, but takes more time than a simple LIC upgrade. Features Max68 and Max200 are factory build only.

takes more time than a simple LIC upgrade. Features Max68 and Max200 are factory build only.

For more information about Capacity on Demand, see Chapter 8, 'System upgrades' on page 327.

PU sparing

If a PU failure occurs, the failed PU's characterization is dynamically and transparently reassigned to a spare PU. IBM z16 servers have two spare PUs. PUs that are not characterized on a CPC configuration also can be used as extra spare PUs.

For more information about PU sparing, see 3.5.10, 'Sparing rules' on page 111.

PU pools

PUs that are defined as CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs are grouped in their own pools from where they can be managed separately. This configuration significantly simplifies capacity planning and management for LPARs. The separation also affects weight management because CP and zIIP weights can be managed separately.

For more information, see 'PU weighting' on page 99.



--- Chunk 2863 ---
capacity planning and management for LPARs. The separation also affects weight management because CP and zIIP weights can be managed separately.

For more information, see 'PU weighting' on page 99.

All assigned PUs are grouped in the PU pool. These PUs are dispatched to online logical PUs. For example, consider an IBM z16 with 10 CPs, 2 IFLs, 5 zIIPs, and 1 ICF. This system has a PU pool of 18 PUs, called the pool width . Subdivision defines the following pools:

- /SM590000 A CP pool of 10 CPs
- /SM590000 An ICF pool of one ICF
- /SM590000 An IFL pool of two IFLs
- /SM590000 A zIIP pool of five zIIPs

PUs are placed in the pools in the following circumstances:

- /SM590000 When the system is PORed
- /SM590000 At the time of a concurrent upgrade
- /SM590000 As a result of adding PUs during a CBU
- /SM590000 Following a capacity on-demand upgrade through On/Off CoD or CIU.



--- Chunk 2864 ---
n the system is PORed

- /SM590000 As a result of adding PUs during a CBU
- /SM590000 Following a capacity on-demand upgrade through On/Off CoD or CIU.

PUs are removed from their pools when a concurrent downgrade occurs as the result of the removal of a CBU. They also are removed through the On/Off CoD process and the conversion of a PU. When a dedicated LPAR is activated, its PUs are taken from the correct pools. This process also is the case when an LPAR logically configures a PU as on, if the width of the pool allows for it.

For an LPAR, logical PUs are dispatched from the supporting pool only. The logical CPs are dispatched from the CP pool, logical zIIPs from the zIIP pool, logical IFLs from the IFL pool, and the logical ICFs from the ICF pool.

PU weighting

Because CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, and ICFs have their own pools from where they are dispatched, they can be given their own weights. For more information about PU pools and processing weights, see the Processor Resource/Systems Manager Planning Guide , SB10-7178.

3.5.2  Central processors

A central processor (CP) is a PU that uses the full z/Architecture instruction set. It can run z/Architecture-based operating systems (z/OS, z/VM, TPF, z/TPF, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z) and the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). Up to 200 PUs can be characterized as CPs, depending on the configuration.

The IBM z16 can be initialized in LPAR (PR/SM) mode or in Dynamic Partition Manger (DPM) mode.



--- Chunk 2866 ---
cility Control Code (CFCC). Up to 200 PUs can be characterized as CPs, depending on the configuration.

The IBM z16 can be initialized in LPAR (PR/SM) mode or in Dynamic Partition Manger (DPM) mode.

CPs are defined as dedicated or shared. Reserved CPs can be defined to an LPAR to allow for nondisruptive image upgrades. If the operating system in the LPAR supports the logical processor add function, reserved processors are no longer needed. Regardless of the installed model, an LPAR can have up to 200 logical CPs that are defined (the sum of active and reserved logical CPs). In practice, define no more CPs than the operating system supports.

All PUs that are characterized as CPs within a configuration are grouped into the CP pool. The CP pool can be seen on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) workplace. Any z/Architecture operating systems and CFCCs can run on CPs that are assigned from the CP pool.



--- Chunk 2867 ---
rouped into the CP pool. The CP pool can be seen on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) workplace. Any z/Architecture operating systems and CFCCs can run on CPs that are assigned from the CP pool.

The IBM z16 A01 server recognizes four distinct capacity settings for CPs. Full-capacity CPs are identified as CP7. In addition to full-capacity CPs, three subcapacity settings (CP6, CP5, and CP4), each for up to 39 PUs, are offered.

The following capacity settings appear in hardware descriptions:

- /SM590000 CP4 Feature Code 1955 (up to 39 PUs)
- /SM590000 CP5 Feature Code 1956 (up to 39 PUs)
- /SM590000 CP6 Feature Code 1957 (up to 39 PUs)
- /SM590000 CP7 Feature Code 1958 (up to 200 PUs)

Granular capacity adds 117 subcapacity settings to the 200 capacity settings that are available with full capacity CPs (CP7). Each of the 117 subcapacity settings applies to up to 39 CPs only, independent of the model installed.

3.5.3  Integrated Facility for Linux (FC 1959)

An IFL is a PU that can be used to run Linux, Linux guests on z/VM operating systems, and an IBM Secure Service Container (SSC). Up to 200 PUs can be characterized as IFLs, depending on the configuration.

Note: IFLs can be dedicated to a Linux, a z/VM, or an SSC LPAR, or can be shared by multiple Linux guests, z/VM LPARs, or SSC that are running on the same IBM z16 server. Only z/VM, Linux on IBM Z operating systems, SSC, and designated software products can run on IFLs. IFLs are orderable by using FC 1959.

IFLs do not change the model capacity identifier of the IBM z16. Software product license charges that are based on the model capacity identifier are not affected by the addition of IFLs.

Unassigned IFLs

An IFL that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned IFL (FC 1962). When the system is later upgraded with another IFL, the system recognizes that an IFL was purchased and is present.

3.5.4  Internal Coupling Facility (FC 1960)

An Internal Coupling Facility (ICF) is a PU that is used to run the CFCC for Parallel Sysplex environments. Within the sum of all unassigned PUs in up to four CPC drawers, up to 200 ICFs can be characterized, depending on the model. However, the maximum number of ICFs that can be defined on a coupling facility LPAR is limited to 16. ICFs are orderable by using FC 1960.

Unassigned ICFs

New on IBM z16, an ICF that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned ICF (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present.

The allowable number of ICFs and Unassigned ICFs for each model is listed in Table 3-2.

All ICFs within a configuration are grouped into the ICF pool. The ICF pool can be seen on the HMC workplace.

The ICFs can be used by coupling facility LPARs only. ICFs are dedicated or shared. ICFs can be dedicated to a CF LPAR, or shared by multiple CF LPARs that run on the same system. However, having an LPAR with dedicated and shared ICFs at the same time is not possible.

Coupling Thin Interrupts

With the introduction of Driver 15F (zEC12 and zBC12), the IBM z/Architecture provides a thin interrupt class called Coupling Thin Interrupts 5 . The capabilities that are provided by hardware, firmware, and software support the generation of coupling-related 'Thin Interrupts' when the following situations occur:

- /SM590000 On the coupling facility (CF) side:
- -A CF command or a CF signal (arrival of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal) is received by a shared-engine CF image.
- -The completion of a CF signal that was previously sent by the CF occurs (completion of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal).
- /SM590000 On the z/OS side:
- -CF signal is received by a shared-engine z/OS image (arrival of a List Notification signal).
- -An asynchronous CF operation completes.



--- Chunk 2873 ---
a CF-to-CF duplexing signal).
- /SM590000 On the z/OS side:
- -CF signal is received by a shared-engine z/OS image (arrival of a List Notification signal).
- -An asynchronous CF operation completes.

The interrupt causes the receiving partition to be dispatched by an LPAR if it is not dispatched. This process allows the request, signal, or request completion to be recognized and processed in a more timely manner.

After the image is dispatched, 'poll for work' logic in CFCC and z/OS can be used largely as-is to locate and process the work. The new interrupt expedites the redispatching of the partition.

LPAR presents these Coupling Thin Interrupts to the guest partition, so CFCC and z/OS both require interrupt handler support that can deal with them. CFCC also changes to relinquish control of the processor when all available pending work is exhausted, or when the LPAR undispatches it off the shared processor, whichever comes first.

CF processor combinations



--- Chunk 2874 ---
nges to relinquish control of the processor when all available pending work is exhausted, or when the LPAR undispatches it off the shared processor, whichever comes first.

CF processor combinations

A CF image can have one of the following combinations that are defined in the image profile:

- /SM590000 Dedicated ICFs
- /SM590000 Shared ICFs
- /SM590000 Dedicated CPs
- /SM590000 Shared CPs

Shared ICFs add flexibility. However, running only with shared coupling facility PUs (ICFs or CPs) is not a preferable production configuration. It is preferable for a production CF to operate by using dedicated ICFs.

In Figure 3-18, the CPC on the left has two environments that are defined (production and test), and each has one z/OS and one coupling facility image. The coupling facility images share an ICF.

--- Chunk 2875 ---
 CPC on the left has two environments that are defined (production and test), and each has one z/OS and one coupling facility image. The coupling facility images share an ICF.

The LPAR processing weights are used to define how much processor capacity each CF image can include. The capped option also can be set for a test CF image to protect the production environment.

Connections between these z/OS and CF images can use internal coupling links to avoid the use of real (external) coupling links, and get the best link bandwidth available.

Dynamic CF dispatching

The dynamic coupling facility dispatching (DYNDISP) function features a dispatching algorithm that you can use to define a backup CF in an LPAR on the system. When this LPAR is in backup mode, it uses few processor resources.

DYNDISP allows more environments with multiple CF images to coexist in a server, and to share CF engines with reasonable performance. DYNDISP THIN is the only option for CF images that use shared processors on IBM z16. For more information, see 3.9.3, 'Dynamic CF dispatching' on page 139.

Coupling Facility Processor scalability

CF work management and dispatcher changed to improve efficiency as processors are added to scale up the capacity of a CF image.

CF images support up to 16 processors. To obtain sufficient CF capacity, customers might be forced to split the CF workload across more CF images. However, this change brings more configuration complexity and granularity (more, smaller CF images, more coupling links, and logical CHPIDs to define and manage for connectivity, and so on).

To improve CF processor scaling for the customer's CF images and to make effective use of more processors as the sysplex workload increases, CF work management and dispatcher provide the following improvements IBM z16:

- /SM590000 IBM z16 provides improved CF processor scalability for CF images.
- /SM590000 Increased number of CF tasks
- /SM590000 ICA SR latency improvements that improve coupling efficiency in a parallel sysplex.

A zIIP 6 reduces the standard processor (CP) capacity requirements for z/OS Java, XML system services applications, and a portion of work of z/OS Communications Server and Db2 UDB for z/OS Version 8 or later, which frees up capacity for other workload requirements.

A zIIP enables eligible z/OS workloads to have a portion of them directed for execution to a processor that is characterized as a zIIP. Because the zIIPs do not increase the MSU value of the processor, they do not affect the IBM software license changes.

IBM z16 is the fourth generation of IBM Z processors to support SMT. IBM z16 servers implement two threads per core on IFLs and zIIPs. SMT must be enabled at the LPAR level and supported by the z/OS operating system. SMT was enhanced for IBM z16 and it is enabled for SAPs by default (no customer intervention required).

Introduced in z/OS V2R4, the z/OS Container Extensions 7  allows deployment of Linux on IBM Z software components, such as Docker Containers in a z/OS system, in direct support of z/OS workloads without requiring a separately provisioned Linux server. It also maintains overall solution operational control within z/OS and with z/OS qualities of service. Workload deployed in z/OS Container Extensions is zIIP eligible.

How zIIPs work

zIIPs are designed for supporting designated z/OS workloads. One of the workloads is Java code execution. When Java code must be run (for example, under control of IBM WebSphere), the z/OS JVM calls the function of the zIIP. The z/OS dispatcher then suspends the JVM task on the CP that it is running on and dispatches it on an available zIIP. After the Java application code execution is finished, z/OS redispatches the JVM task on an available CP. After this process occurs, normal processing is resumed.

This process reduces the CP time that is needed to run Java WebSphere applications, which frees that capacity for other workloads.

lable CP. After this process occurs, normal processing is resumed.

This process reduces the CP time that is needed to run Java WebSphere applications, which frees that capacity for other workloads.

The logical flow of Java code that is running on an IBM z16 that has a zIIP available is shown in Figure 3-19. When JVM starts the execution of a Java program, it passes control to the z/OS dispatcher that verifies the availability of a zIIP.

The availability is treated in the following manner:

The availability is treated in the following manner:

- /SM590000 If a zIIP is available (not busy), the dispatcher suspends the JVM task on the CP and assigns the Java task to the zIIP. When the task returns control to the JVM, it passes control back to the dispatcher. The dispatcher then reassigns the JVM code execution to a CP.
- /SM590000 If no zIIP is available (all busy), the z/OS dispatcher allows the Java task to run on a standard CP. This process depends on the option that is used in the OPT statement in the IEAOPTxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB.



--- Chunk 2883 ---
s available (all busy), the z/OS dispatcher allows the Java task to run on a standard CP. This process depends on the option that is used in the OPT statement in the IEAOPTxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB.

A zIIP runs IBM authorized code only. This IBM authorized code includes the z/OS JVM in association with parts of system code, such as the z/OS dispatcher and supervisor services. A zIIP cannot process I/O or clock comparator interruptions. It also does not support operator controls, such as IPL.

Java application code can run on a CP or a zIIP. The installation can manage the use of CPs so that Java application code runs only on CPs or zIIPs, or on both.

The following execution options for zIIP-eligible code execution are available and supported for z/OS 8 . These options are user-specified in IEAOPTxx and can be dynamically altered by using the SET OPT command:

- /SM590000 Option 1: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=YES)

rted for z/OS 8 . These options are user-specified in IEAOPTxx and can be dynamically altered by using the SET OPT command:

- /SM590000 Option 1: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=YES)

This option is the default option and specifies that CPs must not automatically consider zIIP-eligible work for dispatching on them. The zIIP-eligible work is dispatched on the zIIP engines until Workload Manager (WLM) determines that the zIIPs are overcommitted.

WLM then requests help from the CPs. When help is requested, the CPs consider dispatching zIIP-eligible work on the CPs based on the dispatching priority relative to other workloads. When the zIIP engines are no longer overcommitted, the CPs stop considering zIIP-eligible work for dispatch.

This option runs as much zIIP-eligible work on zIIPs as possible. It also allows it to spill over onto the CPs only when the zIIPs are overcommitted.



--- Chunk 2885 ---
op considering zIIP-eligible work for dispatch.

This option runs as much zIIP-eligible work on zIIPs as possible. It also allows it to spill over onto the CPs only when the zIIPs are overcommitted.

- /SM590000 Option 2: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=NO)
- zIIP-eligible work runs on zIIPs only while at least one zIIP engine is online. zIIP-eligible work is not normally dispatched on a CP, even if the zIIPs are overcommitted and CPs are unused. The exception is that zIIP-eligible work can sometimes run on a CP to resolve resource conflicts.

Therefore, zIIP-eligible work does not affect the CP utilization that is used for reporting through the subcapacity reporting tool (SCRT), no matter how busy the zIIPs are.

If zIIPs are defined to the LPAR but are not online, the zIIP-eligible work units are processed by CPs in order of priority. The system ignores the IIPHONORPRIORITY parameter in this case and handles the work as though it had no eligibility to zIIPs.

- /SM590000 Simplification of infrastructure as a result of the colocation and integration of new applications with their associated database systems and transaction middleware, such as Db2, IMS, or CICS.

- /SM590000 Query processing of network-connected applications that access the Db2 database over a TCP/IP connection by using IBM Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA).
- DRDA enables relational data to be distributed among multiple systems. It is native to Db2 for z/OS, which reduces the need for more gateway products that can affect performance and availability. The application uses the DRDA requester or server to access a remote database. IBM Db2 Connect is an example of a DRDA application requester.
- /SM590000 Star schema query processing, which is mostly used in business intelligence work.
- A star schema is a relational database schema for representing multidimensional data. It stores data in a central fact table and is surrounded by more dimension tables that hold information about each perspective of the data. For example, a star schema query joins various dimensions of a star schema data set.

l fact table and is surrounded by more dimension tables that hold information about each perspective of the data. For example, a star schema query joins various dimensions of a star schema data set.

- /SM590000 Db2 utilities that are used for index maintenance, such as LOAD, REORG, and REBUILD.
- Indexes allow quick access to table rows. However, the databases become less efficient over time and must be maintained as data in large databases is manipulated.

The zIIP runs portions of eligible database workloads, which helps to free computer capacity and lower software costs. Not all Db2 workloads are eligible for zIIP processing. Db2 UDB for z/OS V8 and later gives z/OS the information to direct portions of the work to the zIIP. The result is that in every user situation, different variables determine how much work is redirected to the zIIP.

- /SM590000 z/OS Communications Server uses the zIIP for eligible Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) network encryption workloads. Portions of IPSec processing take advantage of the zIIPs, specifically end-to-end encryption with IPSec. The IPSec function moves a portion of the processing from the general-purpose processors to the zIIPs. In addition, to run the encryption processing, the zIIP also handles the cryptographic validation of message integrity and IPSec header processing.
- /SM590000 z/OS Global Mirror, formerly known as Extended Remote Copy (XRC), also uses the zIIP. Most z/OS Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (DFSMS) system data mover (SDM) processing that is associated with z/OS Global Mirror can run on the zIIP.

- /SM590000 The first IBM user of z/OS XML system services is Db2 V9. For Db2 V9 before the z/OS XML System Services enhancement, z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing was partially directed to zIIPs when used as part of a distributed Db2 request through DRDA. This enhancement benefits Db2 by making all z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing eligible to zIIPs. This configuration is possible when processing is used as part of any workload that is running in enclave SRB mode.
- /SM590000 z/OS Communications Server also allows the HiperSockets Multiple Write operation for outbound large messages (originating from z/OS) to be run by a zIIP. Application workloads that are based on XML, HTTP, SOAP, and Java, and traditional file transfer can benefit.

zIIP installation

One CP must be installed with or before any zIIP is installed. In IBM z16 A01, the zIIP-to-CP ratio is 2:1 9 , which means that up to 132 zIIPs on feature Max200 can be characterized.

Unassigned zIIPs

New on IBM z16, an ICF that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned ICF (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present.

The allowable number of zIIPs for each model is listed in Table 3-3.



--- Chunk 3356 ---
F (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present.

The allowable number of zIIPs for each model is listed in Table 3-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

zIIPs are orderable by using FC 1961. Up to two zIIPs can be ordered for each CP or marked CP configured in the system. If the installed CPC drawer has no remaining unassigned PUs, the assignment of the next zIIP might require the installation of another CPC drawer.

PUs that are characterized as zIIPs within a configuration are grouped into the zIIP pool. This configuration allows zIIPs to have their own processing weights, independent of the weight of parent CPs. The zIIP pool can be seen on the hardware console.

The number of permanent zIIPs plus temporary zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs plus temporary CPs. Also, the number of temporary zIIPs cannot exceed the number of permanent zIIPs.

zIIPs and logical partition definitions



--- Chunk 3357 ---
ry zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs plus temporary CPs. Also, the number of temporary zIIPs cannot exceed the number of permanent zIIPs.

zIIPs and logical partition definitions

zIIPs are dedicated or shared, depending on whether they are part of an LPAR with dedicated or shared CPs. In an LPAR, at least one CP must be defined before zIIPs for that partition can be defined. The number of zIIPs that are available in the system is the number of zIIPs that can be defined to an LPAR.

LPAR: In an LPAR, as many zIIPs as are available can be defined together with at least one CP.

3.5.6  System assist processors

A system assist processor (SAP) is a PU that runs the channel subsystem LIC to control I/O operations. All SAPs run I/O operations for all LPARs. As with IBM z14 and IBM z15 servers, in IBM z16 SMT is enabled 10  for SAPs. All features include standard SAPs configured. The number of standard SAPs depends on the IBM z16 feature, as listed in Table 3-4.

<!-- missing-text -->

SAP configuration

A standard SAP configuration provides a well-balanced system for most environments. However, some application environments feature high I/O rates, typically Transaction Processing Facility (TPF) environments. In this case, more SAPs can be ordered.

Assigning more SAPs can increase the capability of the channel subsystem to run I/O operations. In IBM z16 systems, the number of SAPs plus the number of optional SAPs cannot exceed firmware limit of 128 threads.

Optional other orderable SAPs (FC 1963)

channel subsystem to run I/O operations. In IBM z16 systems, the number of SAPs plus the number of optional SAPs cannot exceed firmware limit of 128 threads.

Optional other orderable SAPs (FC 1963)

The option to order more SAPs is available on all models (FC 1963). These extra SAPs increase the capacity of the channel subsystem to run I/O operations, which is suggested for TPF environments. The maximum number of optional extra orderable SAPs depends on the configuration and the number of available uncharacterized PUs. The number of SAPs is listed in Table 3-5.

3.5.7  Reserved processors

Reserved processors are defined by PR/SM to allow for a nondisruptive capacity upgrade. Reserved processors are similar to spare logical processors and can be shared or dedicated. Reserved CPs can be defined to an LPAR dynamically to allow for nondisruptive image upgrades.



--- Chunk 3360 ---
ity upgrade. Reserved processors are similar to spare logical processors and can be shared or dedicated. Reserved CPs can be defined to an LPAR dynamically to allow for nondisruptive image upgrades.

Reserved processors can be dynamically configured online by an operating system that supports this function if enough unassigned PUs are available to satisfy the request. The PR/SM rules that govern logical processor activation remain unchanged.

By using reserved processors, you can define more logical processors than the number of available CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs in the configuration to an LPAR. This process makes it possible to nondisruptively configure online more logical processors after more CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs are made available concurrently. They can be made available with one of the capacity on-demand options.



--- Chunk 3361 ---
nondisruptively configure online more logical processors after more CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs are made available concurrently. They can be made available with one of the capacity on-demand options.

The maximum number of reserved processors that can be defined to an LPAR depends on the number of logical processors that are defined. A maximum of 300 logical processors plus reserved processors can be used. If the operating system in the LPAR supports the logical processor add function, reserved processors are no longer needed.

Do not define more active and reserved processors than the operating system for the LPAR can support. For more information about logical processors and reserved processors and their definitions, see 3.7, 'Logical partitioning' on page 117.

3.5.8  Integrated firmware processors

Integrated Firmware Processors (IFP) are allocated from the pool of PUs and are available for the entire system. Unlike other characterized PUs, IFPs are standard on all IBM z16 models and not defined by the client.

The two PUs that are characterized as IFP are dedicated to supporting firmware functions that are implemented in Licensed Internal Code (LIC); for example, the resource groups (RGs) that are used for managing the following native Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) features:

- /SM590000 10GbE and 25GbE RoCE Express3 Short Reach (SR) and Long Reach (LR)
- /SM590000 10GbE and 25GbE RoCE Express2
- /SM590000 10GbE and 25GbE RoCE Express2.1
- /SM590000 Coupling Express2 Long Reach

- /SM590000 10GbE and 25GbE RoCE Express2.1
- /SM590000 Coupling Express2 Long Reach

IFPs also are initialized at POR. They support Resource Group (RG) LIC 11  to provide native PCIe I/O feature management and virtualization functions.

3.5.9  Processor unit assignment

The processor unit assignment of characterized PUs is done at POR time when the system is initialized. The initial assignment rules keep PUs of the same characterization type grouped as much as possible in relation to PU chips and CPC drawer boundaries to optimize shared cache usage.

The IBM z16 A01 PU assignment is based on CPC drawer plug order ( not 'ordering'). Feature upgrade provides more processor (CPC) drawers. Max125 cannot be upgraded because the supposed targeted features (Max168 and Max200) are factory built only.



--- Chunk 3364 ---
awer plug order ( not 'ordering'). Feature upgrade provides more processor (CPC) drawers. Max125 cannot be upgraded because the supposed targeted features (Max168 and Max200) are factory built only.

The CPC drawers are populated from the bottom up. This process defines the low-order and the high-order CPC drawers:

- /SM590000 CPC drawer 1 (CPC 0 at position A10): Plug order 1 (low-order CPC drawer)
- /SM590000 CPC drawer 2 (CPC 1 at position A15): Plug order 2
- /SM590000 CPC drawer 3 (CPC 2 at position A20): Plug order 3 (high-order CPC drawer)

The assignment rules comply with the following order:

- /SM590000 SAPs: Spread across CPC drawers and high PU chips. Each CPC drawer includes at least five standard SAPs. Start with the highest PU chip high core, then the next highest PU chip high core.
- /SM590000 CPs and zIIPs: Assign CPs and zIIPs to cores on chips in lower CPC drawers working upward.



--- Chunk 3365 ---
andard SAPs. Start with the highest PU chip high core, then the next highest PU chip high core.
- /SM590000 CPs and zIIPs: Assign CPs and zIIPs to cores on chips in lower CPC drawers working upward.

- /SM590000 IFLs and ICFs: Assign IFLs and ICFs to cores on chips in higher CPC drawers working downward.
- /SM590000 IFP: Two IFPs are assigned to CPC drawer 0 12  for a Max39; CPC drawer 1 for Max82 and Max125 and CPC drawer 2 for Max168 and Max200.
- /SM590000 Spares: Two spares are assigned per model. On z16 there are no specific rules to place them. Any 'unassigned PU' in any drawer can be assigned as spare. For additional information about spare PUs use, refer to 3.5.10, 'Sparing rules'.



--- Chunk 3366 ---
model. On z16 there are no specific rules to place them. Any 'unassigned PU' in any drawer can be assigned as spare. For additional information about spare PUs use, refer to 3.5.10, 'Sparing rules'.

These rules are intended to isolate processors that are used by different operating systems as much as possible on different CPC drawers and even on different PU chips. This configuration ensures that different operating systems do not use the same shared caches. For example, CPs and zIIPs are all used by z/OS, and can benefit by using the same shared caches. However, IFLs are used by z/VM and Linux, and ICFs are used by CFCC.

This initial PU assignment, which is done at POR, can be dynamically rearranged by an LPAR by swapping an active core to a core in a different PU chip in a different CPC drawer to improve system performance. For more information, see 'LPAR dynamic PU reassignment' on page 122.



--- Chunk 3367 ---
 by an LPAR by swapping an active core to a core in a different PU chip in a different CPC drawer to improve system performance. For more information, see 'LPAR dynamic PU reassignment' on page 122.

When a CPC drawer is added concurrently after POR and new LPARs are activated, or processor capacity for active partitions is dynamically expanded, the extra PU capacity can be assigned from the new CPC drawer. The processor unit assignment rules consider the newly installed CPC drawer dynamically.

3.5.10  Sparing rules

On an IBM z16 A01 system, two PUs are reserved as spares. The spare PUs are available to replace any two characterized PUs, whether they are CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, or IFP.

Systems with a failed PU for which no spare is available call home for a replacement. A system with a failed PU that is spared and requires a DCM to be replaced (referred to as a pending repair ) can still be upgraded when sufficient PUs are available.



--- Chunk 3368 ---
le call home for a replacement. A system with a failed PU that is spared and requires a DCM to be replaced (referred to as a pending repair ) can still be upgraded when sufficient PUs are available.

Transparent CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, and IFP sparing

Depending on the model, sparing of CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, and IFP is transparent and does not require operating system or operator intervention.

With transparent sparing , the status of the application that was running on the failed processor is preserved. The application continues processing on a newly assigned CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, or IFP (allocated to one of the spare PUs) without client intervention.

Application preservation

ssor is preserved. The application continues processing on a newly assigned CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, or IFP (allocated to one of the spare PUs) without client intervention.

Application preservation

If no spare PU is available, application preservation (z/OS only) is started. The state of the failing processor is passed to another active processor that is used by the operating system. Through operating system recovery services, the task is resumed successfully (in most cases, without client intervention).

Dynamic SAP and IFP sparing and reassignment



--- Chunk 3370 ---
used by the operating system. Through operating system recovery services, the task is resumed successfully (in most cases, without client intervention).

Dynamic SAP and IFP sparing and reassignment

Dynamic recovery is provided if a failure of the SAP or IFP occurs. If the SAP or IFP fails, and if a spare PU is available, the spare PU is dynamically assigned as a new SAP or IFP. If no spare PU is available, and more than one CP is characterized, a characterized CP is reassigned as an SAP or IFP. In either case, client intervention is not required. This capability eliminates an unplanned outage and allows a service action to be deferred to a more convenient time.

3.5.11  CPC drawer numbering

IBM z16 A01 CPC drawer numbering starts with CPC 0, the first installed CPC drawer. It is in frame A at A10. The second one, in the same frame, at A15. The third one, in the same frame at A20. The fourth CPC drawer is in frame B (location B10).

- /SM590000 Concurrent memory upgrades if the physically installed capacity is reached
- Physical memory upgrades require a processor drawer to be removed and reinstalled after replacing the memory cards in the processor drawer. Except for the feature Max39, the combination of enhanced drawer availability and the flexible memory option allows you to concurrently add memory to the system. For more information, see 2.5.5, 'Drawer replacement and memory' on page 45, and 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

exible memory option allows you to concurrently add memory to the system. For more information, see 2.5.5, 'Drawer replacement and memory' on page 45, and 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

When the total capacity that is installed has more usable memory than required for a configuration, the Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) determines how much memory is used from each processor drawer. The sum of the LICCC provided memory from each CPC drawer is the amount that is available for use in the system.

Memory allocation

When the system is activated by using a POR, PR/SM determines the total installed memory and the customer enabled memory. Later in the process, during LPAR activation, PR/SM assigns and allocates each partition memory according to their image profile.

PR/SM controls all physical memory, and can make physical memory available to the configuration when a CPC drawer is added.



--- Chunk 3478 ---
gns and allocates each partition memory according to their image profile.

PR/SM controls all physical memory, and can make physical memory available to the configuration when a CPC drawer is added.

In older IBM Z processors, memory allocation was striped across the available CPC drawers because relatively fast connectivity (that is, relatively fast to the processor clock frequency) existed between the drawers. Splitting the work between all of the memory controllers allowed a smooth performance variability.

The memory allocation algorithm changed starting with IBM z13fi. For IBM z16, PR/SM tries to allocate memory into a single CPC drawer. If memory does not fit into a single drawer, PR/SM tries to allocate the memory into the CPC drawer with the most processor entitlement.



--- Chunk 3479 ---
z16, PR/SM tries to allocate memory into a single CPC drawer. If memory does not fit into a single drawer, PR/SM tries to allocate the memory into the CPC drawer with the most processor entitlement.

The PR/SM memory and logical processor resources allocation goal is to place all partition resources on a single CPC drawer, if possible. The resources, such as memory and logical processors, are assigned to the logical partitions at the time of their activation. Later on, when all partitions are activated, PR/SM can move memory between CPC drawers to benefit the performance of each LPAR, without operating system knowledge. This process was done on the previous families of IBM Z servers only for PUs that use PR/SM dynamic PU reallocation.

With IBM z16 servers, this process occurs whenever the configuration changes, such as in the following circumstances:



--- Chunk 3480 ---
 families of IBM Z servers only for PUs that use PR/SM dynamic PU reallocation.

With IBM z16 servers, this process occurs whenever the configuration changes, such as in the following circumstances:

- /SM590000 Activating or deactivating an LPAR
- /SM590000 Changing the LPARs processing weights
- /SM590000 Upgrading the system through a temporary or permanent record
- /SM590000 Downgrading the system through deactivation of a temporary record

PR/SM schedules a global reoptimization of the resources in use. It does so by reviewing all the partitions that are active and prioritizing them based on their processing entitlement and weights, which creates a high- and low-priority rank. Then, the resources, such as logical processors and memory, can be moved from one CPC drawer to another to address the priority ranks that were created.



--- Chunk 3481 ---
 which creates a high- and low-priority rank. Then, the resources, such as logical processors and memory, can be moved from one CPC drawer to another to address the priority ranks that were created.

When partitions are activated, PR/SM tries to find a home assignment CPC drawer, home assignment node, and home assignment chip for the logical processors that are defined to them. The PR/SM goal is to allocate all the partition logical processors and memory to a single CPC drawer (the home drawer for that partition).

If all logical processors can be assigned to a home drawer and the partition-defined memory is greater than what is available in that drawer, the exceeding memory amount is allocated on another CPC drawer. If all the logical processors cannot fit in one CPC drawer, the remaining logical processors spill to another CPC drawer. When that overlap occurs, PR/SM stripes the memory (if possible) across the CPC drawers where the logical processors are assigned.



--- Chunk 3482 ---
awer, the remaining logical processors spill to another CPC drawer. When that overlap occurs, PR/SM stripes the memory (if possible) across the CPC drawers where the logical processors are assigned.

The process of reallocating memory is based on the memory copy/reassign function, which is used to allow enhanced drawer availability (EDA) and concurrent drawer replacement (CDR) 13 . This process was enhanced starting with z13 and IBM z13sfi to provide more efficiency and speed to the process without affecting system performance.

EDA) and concurrent drawer replacement (CDR) 13 . This process was enhanced starting with z13 and IBM z13sfi to provide more efficiency and speed to the process without affecting system performance.

IBM z16 A01 implements a faster dynamic memory reallocation mechanism, which is especially useful during service operations (EDA and CDR). PR/SM controls the reassignment of the content of a specific physical memory array in one CPC drawer to a physical memory array in another CPC drawer. To accomplish this task, PR/SM uses all the available physical memory in the system. This memory includes the memory that is not in use by the system that is available but not purchased by the client, and the planned memory options, if installed.



--- Chunk 3484 ---
lable physical memory in the system. This memory includes the memory that is not in use by the system that is available but not purchased by the client, and the planned memory options, if installed.

Because of the memory allocation algorithm, systems that undergo many miscellaneous equipment specification (MES) upgrades for memory can have different memory mixes and quantities in all processor drawers of the system. If the memory fails, it is technically feasible to run a POR of the system with the remaining working memory resources. After the POR completes, the memory distribution across the processor drawers is different, as is the total amount of available memory.

Large page support

th the remaining working memory resources. After the POR completes, the memory distribution across the processor drawers is different, as is the total amount of available memory.

Large page support

By default, page frames are allocated with a 4 KB size. IBM z16 servers also support large page sizes of 1 MB or 2 GB. The first z/OS release that supports 1 MB pages is z/OS V1R9. Linux on IBM Z 1 MB pages support is available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.2 and later.

The TLB reduces the amount of time that is required to translate a virtual address to a real address. This translation is done by dynamic address translation (DAT) when it must find the correct page for the correct address space.

Each TLB entry represents one page. As with other buffers or caches, lines are discarded from the TLB on a least recently used (LRU) basis.



--- Chunk 3486 ---
must find the correct page for the correct address space.

Each TLB entry represents one page. As with other buffers or caches, lines are discarded from the TLB on a least recently used (LRU) basis.

The worst-case translation time occurs when a TLB miss occurs and the segment table (which is needed to find the page table) and the page table (which is needed to find the entry for the particular page in question) are not in cache. This case involves two complete real memory access delays plus the address translation delay. The duration of a processor cycle is much shorter than the duration of a memory cycle, so a TLB miss is relatively costly.

It is preferable to have addresses in the TLB. With 4 K pages, holding all of the addresses for 1 MB of storage takes 256 TLB lines. When 1 MB pages are used, it takes only one TLB line. Therefore, large page size users have a much smaller TLB footprint.



--- Chunk 3487 ---
pages, holding all of the addresses for 1 MB of storage takes 256 TLB lines. When 1 MB pages are used, it takes only one TLB line. Therefore, large page size users have a much smaller TLB footprint.

Large pages allow the TLB to better represent a large working set and suffer fewer TLB misses by allowing a single TLB entry to cover more address translations.

Users of large pages are better represented in the TLB and are expected to see performance improvements in elapsed time and processor usage. These improvements are because DAT and memory operations are part of processor busy time, even though the processor waits for memory operations to complete without processing anything else in the meantime.

To overcome the processor usage that is associated with creating a 1 MB page, a process must run for some time. It also must maintain frequent memory access to keep the pertinent addresses in the TLB.



--- Chunk 3488 ---
 overcome the processor usage that is associated with creating a 1 MB page, a process must run for some time. It also must maintain frequent memory access to keep the pertinent addresses in the TLB.

Short-running work does not overcome the processor usage. Short processes with small working sets are expected to receive little or no improvement. Long-running work with high memory-access frequency is the best candidate to benefit from large pages.

Long-running work with low memory-access frequency is less likely to maintain its entries in the TLB. However, when it does run, few address translations are required to resolve all of the memory it needs. Therefore, a long-running process can benefit even without frequent memory access.

Weigh the benefits of whether something in this category must use large pages as a result of the system-level costs of tying up real storage. A balance exists between the performance of a process that uses large pages and the performance of the remaining work on the system.

On IBM z16 server, 1 MB large pages become pageable if Virtual Flash Memory 14  is available and enabled. They are available only for 64-bit virtual private storage, such as virtual memory that is above 2 GB.

 server, 1 MB large pages become pageable if Virtual Flash Memory 14  is available and enabled. They are available only for 64-bit virtual private storage, such as virtual memory that is above 2 GB.

It is easy to assume that increasing the TLB size is a feasible option to deal with TLB-miss situations. However, this process is not as simple as it seems. As the size of the TLB increases, so does the processor usage that is involved in managing the TLB's contents. Correct sizing of the TLB is subject to complex statistical modeling to find the optimal tradeoff between size and performance.

3.6.2  Main storage

Main storage consists of memory space that is addressable by programs and storage that is not directly addressable by programs. Nonaddressable storage includes the hardware system area (HSA).

Main storage provides the following functions:

t is addressable by programs and storage that is not directly addressable by programs. Nonaddressable storage includes the hardware system area (HSA).

Main storage provides the following functions:

- /SM590000 Data storage and retrieval for PUs and I/O
- /SM590000 Communication with PUs and I/O
- /SM590000 Communication with and control of optional expanded storage
- /SM590000 Error checking and correction

Main storage can be accessed by all processors, but cannot be shared between LPARs. Any system image (LPAR) must include a defined main storage size. This defined main storage is allocated exclusively to the LPAR during partition activation.

3.6.3  Hardware system area

The HSA is a nonaddressable storage area that contains system LIC and configuration-dependent control blocks. On IBM z16 A01 servers, the HSA has a fixed size of 256 GB and is not part of the purchased memory that you order and install.

ea that contains system LIC and configuration-dependent control blocks. On IBM z16 A01 servers, the HSA has a fixed size of 256 GB and is not part of the purchased memory that you order and install.

The fixed size of the HSA eliminates planning for future expansion of the HSA because the hardware configuration definition (HCD)/input/output configuration program (IOCP) always reserves space for the following items:

- /SM590000 Six channel subsystems (CSSs)
- /SM590000 A total of 15 LPARs in CSSs 1 through 5, and 10 LPARs for the sixth CSS for a total of 85 LPARs
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 0 with 63.75-K devices in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 1 with 64-K devices in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 2 with 64-K devices in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 3 with 64-K devices in each CSS

The HSA features sufficient reserved space to allow for dynamic I/O reconfiguration changes to the maximum capability of the processor.

IBM Virtual Flash Memory (VFM, FC 0644) is the replacement for the Flash Express features that were available on the IBM zEC12 and IBM z13. No application changes are required to change from IBM Flash Express to VFM.

For IBM z16 A01, IBM VFM provides up to 6.0 TB of virtual flash memory in 512 GB increments. The minimum is 0, while the maximum is 12 features. The number of VFM features ordered reduces the maximum orderable memory for the IBM z16.

3.7  Logical partitioning

The logical partitioning features are described in this section.

3.7.1  Overview

Logical partitioning is a function that is implemented by the PR/SM on IBM z16. IBM z16 can run in LPAR mode, or in DPM mode. DPM provides a GUI for PR/SM to manage I/O resources dynamically.

Logical partitioning is a function that is implemented by the PR/SM on IBM z16. IBM z16 can run in LPAR mode, or in DPM mode. DPM provides a GUI for PR/SM to manage I/O resources dynamically.

PR/SM is aware of the processor drawer structure on IBM z16 servers. However, LPARs do not feature this awareness. LPARs feature resources that are allocated to them from various physical resources. From a systems standpoint, LPARs have no control over these physical resources, but the PR/SM functions do have this control.

PR/SM manages and optimizes allocation and the dispatching of work on the physical topology. Most physical topology that was handled by the operating systems is the responsibility of PR/SM.

As described in 3.5.9, 'Processor unit assignment' on page 110, the initial PU assignment is done during POR by using rules to optimize cache usage. This step is the 'physical' step, where CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and SAPs are allocated on the processor drawers.



--- Chunk 3495 ---
 the initial PU assignment is done during POR by using rules to optimize cache usage. This step is the 'physical' step, where CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and SAPs are allocated on the processor drawers.

When an LPAR is activated, PR/SM builds logical processors and allocates memory for the LPAR.

PR/SM assigns all logical processors to one CPC drawer that are packed into chips of that drawer and cooperates with operating system use of HiperDispatch.

All processor types of an IBM z16 can be dynamically reassigned, except IFPs.

Memory allocation changed from the previous IBM Z servers. Partition memory is now allocated based on processor drawer affinity. For more information, see 'Memory allocation' on page 113.

Logical processors are dispatched by PR/SM on physical processors. The assignment topology that is used by PR/SM to dispatch logical processors on physical PUs is also based on cache usage optimization.



--- Chunk 3496 ---
cal processors are dispatched by PR/SM on physical processors. The assignment topology that is used by PR/SM to dispatch logical processors on physical PUs is also based on cache usage optimization.

Processor drawers assignment is more important because they optimize virtual L4 cache usage. Therefore, logical processors from a specific LPAR are packed into a processor drawer as much as possible.

PR/SM optimizes chip assignments within the assigned processor drawer (or drawers) to maximize virtual L3 cache efficiency. Logical processors from an LPAR are dispatched on physical processors on the same PU chip as much as possible.

PR/SM also tries to redispatch a logical processor on the same physical processor to optimize private cache (L1 and L2) usage.

HiperDispatch

PR/SM and z/OS work in tandem to use processor resources more efficiently. HiperDispatch is a function that combines the dispatcher actions and the knowledge that PR/SM has about the topology of the system.



--- Chunk 3497 ---
d z/OS work in tandem to use processor resources more efficiently. HiperDispatch is a function that combines the dispatcher actions and the knowledge that PR/SM has about the topology of the system.

Performance can be optimized by redispatching units of work to the same processor group, which keeps processes running near their cached instructions and data, and minimizes transfers of data ownership among processors and processor drawers.

The nested topology is returned to z/OS by the Store System Information (STSI) instruction. HiperDispatch uses the information to concentrate logical processors around shared caches (virtual L3 and virtual L4 caches at drawer level), and dynamically optimizes the assignment of logical processors and units of work.



--- Chunk 3498 ---
formation to concentrate logical processors around shared caches (virtual L3 and virtual L4 caches at drawer level), and dynamically optimizes the assignment of logical processors and units of work.

z/OS dispatcher manages multiple queues, called affinity queues , with a target number of eight processors per queue, which fits well onto a single PU chip. These queues are used to assign work to as few logical processors as are needed for an LPAR workload. Therefore, even if the LPAR is defined with many logical processors, HiperDispatch optimizes this number of processors to be near the required capacity. The optimal number of processors to be used is kept within a processor drawer boundary, when possible.

Tip: z/VM V7R1 and later also support HiperDispatch.

Tip: z/VM V7R1 and later also support HiperDispatch.

Logical partitions

PR/SM enables IBM z16 A01 systems to be initialized for a logically partitioned operation, supporting up to 85 LPARs. Each LPAR can run its own operating system image in any image mode, independently from the other LPARs.

An LPAR can be added, removed, activated, or deactivated at any time. Changing the number of LPARs is not disruptive and does not require a POR. Certain facilities might not be available to all operating systems because the facilities might have software corequisites.

Each LPAR has the following resources that are the same as a real CPC:

- /SM590000 Processors

ght not be available to all operating systems because the facilities might have software corequisites.

Each LPAR has the following resources that are the same as a real CPC:

- /SM590000 Processors

Called l ogical processors , they can be defined as CPs, IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs. They can be dedicated to an LPAR or shared among LPARs. When shared, a processor weight can be defined to provide the required level of processor resources to an LPAR. Also, the capping option can be turned on, which prevents an LPAR from acquiring more than its defined weight and limits its processor consumption.

LPARs for z/OS can have CP and zIIP logical processors. The logical processor types can be defined as all dedicated or all shared. The zIIP support is available in z/OS.



--- Chunk 3501 ---

LPARs for z/OS can have CP and zIIP logical processors. The logical processor types can be defined as all dedicated or all shared. The zIIP support is available in z/OS.

The weight and number of online logical processors of an LPAR can be dynamically managed by the LPAR CPU Management function of the Intelligent Resource Director (IRD). These functions can be used to achieve the defined goals of this specific partition and of the overall system. The provisioning architecture of IBM z16 systems adds a dimension to the dynamic management of LPARs, as described in Chapter 8, 'System upgrades' on page 327.

PR/SM supports an option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP) or an IFL that is shared across a set of LPARs.



--- Chunk 3502 ---
 option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP) or an IFL that is shared across a set of LPARs.

This capability is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) limit. It is not affected by changes to the logical or physical configuration of the system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs. The Change LPAR Controls and Customize Activation Profiles tasks on the HMC were enhanced to support this new function.

system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs. The Change LPAR Controls and Customize Activation Profiles tasks on the HMC were enhanced to support this new function.

For the z/OS Workload License Charges (WLC) pricing metric and metrics that are based on it, such as Advanced Workload License Charges (AWLC), an LPAR defined capacity can be set. This defined capacity enables the soft capping function. Workload charging introduces the capability to pay software license fees that are based on the processor utilization of the LPAR on which the product is running, rather than on the total capacity of the system.

Consider the following points:



--- Chunk 3504 ---
to pay software license fees that are based on the processor utilization of the LPAR on which the product is running, rather than on the total capacity of the system.

Consider the following points:

- -In support of WLC, the user can specify a defined capacity in millions of service units (MSUs) per hour. The defined capacity sets the capacity of an individual LPAR when soft capping is selected.
- The defined capacity value is specified on the Options tab in the Customize Image Profiles window.
- -WLM keeps a four-hour rolling average of the processor usage of the LPAR. When the four-hour average processor consumption exceeds the defined capacity limit, WLM dynamically activates LPAR capping (soft capping). When the rolling four-hour average returns below the defined capacity, the soft cap is removed.

For more information about WLM, see System Programmer's Guide to: Workload Manager , SG24-6472.

For more information about WLM, see System Programmer's Guide to: Workload Manager , SG24-6472.

For more information about software licensing, see 7.8, 'Software licensing' on page 323.

Weight settings: When defined capacity is used to define an uncapped LPAR's capacity, carefully consider the weight settings of that LPAR. If the weight is much smaller than the defined capacity, PR/SM uses a discontinuous cap pattern to achieve the defined capacity setting. This configuration means PR/SM alternates between capping the LPAR at the MSU value that corresponds to the relative weight settings, and no capping at all. It is best to avoid this scenario and instead attempt to establish a defined capacity that is equal or close to the relative weight.

/SM590000 Memory

Memory (main storage) must be dedicated to an LPAR. The defined storage must be available during the LPAR activation; otherwise, the LPAR activation fails.

Reserved storage can be defined to an LPAR, which enables nondisruptive memory addition to and removal from an LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (z/OS and z/VM). For more information, see 3.7.5, 'LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration' on page 127.

- /SM590000 Channels

Channels can be shared between LPARs by including the partition name in the partition list of a channel-path identifier (CHPID). I/O configurations are defined by the IOCP or the HCD with the CHPID mapping tool (CMT). The CHPID Mapping Tool (CMT) is an optional tool that is used to map CHPIDs onto physical channel IDs (PCHIDs). PCHIDs represent the physical location of a port on a card in a PCIe I/O drawer.

IOCP is available on the z/OS, z/VM, and z/VSE operating systems, and as a stand-alone program on the hardware console. For more information, see Input/Output Configuration Program User's Guide for ICP IOCP , SB10-7177. HCD is available on the z/OS and z/VM operating systems. Review the suitable 3931DEVICE Preventive Service Planning (PSP) buckets before implementation.

Fibre Channel connection (FICON) channels can be managed by the Dynamic CHPID Management (DCM) function of the Intelligent Resource Director. DCM enables the system to respond to ever-changing channel requirements by moving channels from lesser-used control units to more heavily used control units, as needed.

Modes of operation

The modes of operation are listed in Table 3-6. All available mode combinations, including their operating modes and processor types, operating systems, and addressing modes, also are listed. Only the currently supported versions of operating systems are considered.

The 64-bit z/Architecture mode has no special operating mode because the architecture mode is not an attribute of the definable images operating mode. The 64-bit operating systems are in 31-bit mode at IPL and change to 64-bit mode during their initialization. The operating system is responsible for taking advantage of the addressing capabilities that are provided by the architectural mode.

For information about operating system support, see Chapter 7, 'Operating system support' on page 247.

Logically partitioned mode

If the IBM z16 A01 system runs in LPAR mode, each of the 85 LPARs can be defined to operate in one of the following image modes:

Logically partitioned mode

If the IBM z16 A01 system runs in LPAR mode, each of the 85 LPARs can be defined to operate in one of the following image modes:

- /SM590000 General mode to run the following systems:
- -A z/Architecture operating system, on dedicated or shared CPs
- -A Linux on IBM Z operating system, on dedicated or shared CPs

Dynamically adding or deleting an LPAR name is the ability to add or delete LPARs and their associated I/O resources to or from the configuration without a POR.

The extra channel subsystem and multiple image facility (MIF) image ID pairs (CSSID/MIFID) can be later assigned to an LPAR for use (or later removed). This process can be done through dynamic I/O commands by using the HCD. At the same time, required channels must be defined for the new LPAR.

Partition profile: Cryptographic coprocessors are not tied to partition numbers or MIF IDs. They are set up with Adjunct Processor (AP) numbers and domain indexes. These numbers are assigned to a partition profile of a specific name. The client assigns these AP numbers and domains to the partitions and continues to have the responsibility to clear them out when their profiles change.

Adding logical processors to a logical partition

Logical processors can be concurrently added to an LPAR by defining them as reserved in the image profile and later configuring them online to the operating system by using the suitable console commands.

Logical processors also can be concurrently added to a logical partition dynamically by using the Support Element (SE) 'Logical Processor Add' function under the CPC Operational Customization task. This SE function allows the initial and reserved processor values to be dynamically changed. The operating system must support the dynamic addition 15  of these resources.

Adding a crypto feature to a logical partition

You can plan the addition of supported Crypto Express features to an LPAR on the crypto page in the image profile by defining the Cryptographic Candidate List, and the Usage and Control Domain indexes, in the partition profile. By using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task, you can add crypto adapters dynamically to an LPAR without an outage of the LPAR. Also, dynamic deletion or moving of these features does not require planning. Support is provided in z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, IBM SSC (based on appliance requirements), and Linux on IBM Z.

deletion or moving of these features does not require planning. Support is provided in z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, IBM SSC (based on appliance requirements), and Linux on IBM Z.

LPAR dynamic PU reassignment

The system configuration is enhanced to optimize the PU-to-CPC drawer assignment of physical processors dynamically. The initial assignment of client-usable physical processors to physical processor drawers can change dynamically to better suit the LPAR configurations that are in use.

For more information, see 3.5.9, 'Processor unit assignment' on page 110.

Swapping of specialty engines and general processors with each other, with spare PUs, or with both, can occur as the system attempts to compact LPAR configurations into physical configurations that span the least number of processor drawers.



--- Chunk 3517 ---
rocessors with each other, with spare PUs, or with both, can occur as the system attempts to compact LPAR configurations into physical configurations that span the least number of processor drawers.

LPAR dynamic PU reassignment can swap client processors of different types between processor drawers. For example, reassignment can swap an IFL on processor drawer 1 with a CP on processor drawer 2. Swaps can also occur between PU chips within a processor drawer or a node and can include spare PUs. The goals are to pack the LPAR on fewer processor drawers and also on fewer PU chips, based on the IBM z16 processor drawers' topology. The effect of this process is evident in dedicated and shared LPARs that use HiperDispatch.

LPAR dynamic PU reassignment is transparent to operating systems.

s process is evident in dedicated and shared LPARs that use HiperDispatch.

LPAR dynamic PU reassignment is transparent to operating systems.

LPAR group capacity limit (LPAR group absolute capping)

The group capacity limit feature allows the definition of a group of LPARs on an IBM z16 system, and limits the combined capacity usage by those LPARs. This process allows the system to manage the group so that the group capacity limits in MSUs per hour are not exceeded. To take advantage of this feature, you must be running z/OS V2R2 or later in all LPARs in the group.

PR/SM and WLM work together to enforce the capacity that is defined for the group and the capacity that is optionally defined for each individual LPAR.

PR/SM and WLM work together to enforce the capacity that is defined for the group and the capacity that is optionally defined for each individual LPAR.

LPAR absolute capping

Absolute capping is a logical partition control that was made available with zEC12 and is supported on IBM z16 systems. With this support, PR/SM and the HMC are enhanced to support a new option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP), zIIP, or an IFL processor that is shared across a set of LPARs.

Unlike traditional LPAR capping, absolute capping is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) value that is not affected by changes to the virtual or physical configuration of the system.



--- Chunk 3520 ---
pping is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) value that is not affected by changes to the virtual or physical configuration of the system.

Absolute capping provides an optional maximum capacity setting for logical partitions that is specified in the absolute processors capacity (for example, 5.00 CPs or 2.75 IFLs). This setting is specified independently by processor type (namely CPs, zIIPs, and IFLs) and provides an enforceable upper limit on the amount of the specified processor type that can be used in a partition.

Absolute capping is ideal for processor types and operating systems that the z/OS WLM cannot control. Absolute capping is not intended as a replacement for defined capacity or group capacity for z/OS, which are managed by WLM.

r processor types and operating systems that the z/OS WLM cannot control. Absolute capping is not intended as a replacement for defined capacity or group capacity for z/OS, which are managed by WLM.

Absolute capping can be used with any z/OS, z/VM, or Linux on IBM Z LPAR (that is running on an IBM Z server). If specified for a z/OS LPAR, absolute capping can be used concurrently with defined capacity or group capacity management for z/OS. When used concurrently, the absolute capacity limit becomes effective before other capping controls.

DPM is an IBM Z server operation mode that provides a simplified approach to create and manage virtualized environments, which reduces the barriers of its adoption for new and existing customers.

The implementation provides built-in integrated capabilities that allow advanced virtualization management on IBM Z servers. With DPM, you can use your Linux and virtualization skills while taking advantage of the full value of IBM Z hardware, robustness, and security in a workload optimized environment.

DPM provides facilities to define and run virtualized computing systems by using a firmware-managed environment that coordinate the physical system resources that are shared by the partitions. The partitions' resources include processors, memory, network, storage, crypto, and accelerators.

DPM provides a new mode of operation for IBM Z servers that provide the following services:

- /SM590000 Lays the foundation for a general IBM Z new user experience.

DPM is not another hypervisor for IBM Z servers. DPM uses the PR/SM hypervisor infrastructure and provides an intelligent interface on top of it that allows customers to define, use, and operate the platform virtualization without IBM Z experience or skills.

3.7.2  Storage operations

In IBM z16 A01 systems, memory can be assigned as main storage, supporting up to 85 LPARs. Before you activate an LPAR, main storage must be defined to the LPAR. All installed storage can be configured as main storage.

Memory cannot be shared between system images (LPARs). It is possible to dynamically reallocate storage resources for z/Architecture LPARs that run operating systems that support dynamic storage reconfiguration (DSR). This process is supported by z/OS, and z/VM. z/VM, in turn, virtualizes this support to its guests.

For more information, see 3.7.5, 'LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration' on page 127.

An LPAR must define an amount of main storage:

- /SM590000 The initial value is the storage size that is allocated to the partition when it is activated.
- /SM590000 The reserved value is another storage capacity that is beyond its initial storage size that an LPAR can acquire dynamically. The reserved storage sizes that are defined to an LPAR do not have to be available when the partition is activated. Instead, they are predefined storage sizes to allow a storage increase, from an LPAR perspective.

Without the reserved storage definition, an LPAR storage upgrade is a disruptive process that requires the following steps:

- 1. Partition deactivation.
- 2. An initial storage size definition change.
- 3. Partition activation.

The extra storage capacity for an LPAR upgrade can come from the following sources:



--- Chunk 3531 ---
g steps:

- 1. Partition deactivation.
- 2. An initial storage size definition change.
- 3. Partition activation.

The extra storage capacity for an LPAR upgrade can come from the following sources:

- /SM590000 Any unused available storage
- /SM590000 Another partition that features released storage
- /SM590000 A memory upgrade

A concurrent LPAR storage upgrade uses DSR. z/OS uses the reconfigurable storage unit (RSU) definition to add or remove storage units in a nondisruptive way.

z/VM V7R1 and later releases support the dynamic addition of memory to a running LPAR by using reserved storage. It also virtualizes this support to its guests. In z/VM 7.1, removing storage from the z/VM LPAR is disruptive. Removing memory from a z/VM guest is not disruptive to the z/VM LPAR.

z/VM V7R2 and later also support Dynamic Memory Downgrade (DMD), which allows the removal of up to 50% of the real storage from a running z/VM system.

SLES 11 and later supports concurrent add and remove.

3.7.4  Logical partition storage granularity

Granularity of main storage for an LPAR depends on the largest main storage amount that is defined for initial or reserved main storage, as listed in Table 3-8 16 .

<!-- missing-text -->

LPAR storage granularity information is required for LPAR image setup and for z/OS RSU definition. On IBM z16 A01, LPARs are limited to a maximum of 16 TB of main storage. However, the maximum amount of memory that is supported by z/OS V2R2, V2R3, and V2R4 is 4 TB. z/OS V2R5 supports up to 16 TB. For z/VM V7R1 the limit is 2 TB, and z/VM V7R2 increases the limit to 4 TB.

pported by z/OS V2R2, V2R3, and V2R4 is 4 TB. z/OS V2R5 supports up to 16 TB. For z/VM V7R1 the limit is 2 TB, and z/VM V7R2 increases the limit to 4 TB.

3.7.5  LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration

Dynamic storage reconfiguration on IBM z16 systems allows an operating system that is running on an LPAR to add (nondisruptively) its reserved storage amount to its configuration. This process can occur only if unused storage exists. This unused storage can be obtained when another LPAR releases storage, or when a concurrent memory upgrade occurs.

With dynamic storage reconfiguration, the unused storage does not have to be continuous.

When an operating system that is running on an LPAR assigns a storage increment to its configuration, PR/SM determines whether any free storage increments are available. PR/SM then dynamically brings the storage online.

tem that is running on an LPAR assigns a storage increment to its configuration, PR/SM determines whether any free storage increments are available. PR/SM then dynamically brings the storage online.

PR/SM dynamically takes offline a storage increment and makes it available to other partitions when an operating system running on an LPAR releases a storage increment.

3.8  Intelligent Resource Director

Intelligent Resource Director (IRD) is an IBM Z capability that is used only by z/OS. IRD is a function that optimizes processor and channel resource utilization across LPARs within a single IBM Z server.



--- Chunk 3535 ---
igent Resource Director (IRD) is an IBM Z capability that is used only by z/OS. IRD is a function that optimizes processor and channel resource utilization across LPARs within a single IBM Z server.

This feature extends the concept of goal-oriented resource management. It does so by grouping system images that are on the same IBM z16 or IBM Z servers that are running in LPAR mode (and in the same Parallel Sysplex) into an LPAR cluster. This configuration allows WLM to manage resources (processor and I/O) across the entire cluster of system images and not only in one single image.

An LPAR cluster is shown in Figure 3-21. It contains three z/OS images and one Linux image that is managed by the cluster. Included as part of the entire Parallel Sysplex is another z/OS image and a CF image. In this example, the scope over which IRD has control is the defined LPAR cluster.

IRD features the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 IRD processor management

WLM dynamically adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR and the processor weight based on the WLM policy. The ability to move the processor weights across an LPAR cluster provides processing power where it is most needed, based on WLM goal mode policy.

The processor management function is automatically deactivated when HiperDispatch is active. However, the LPAR weight management function remains active with IRD with HiperDispatch. For more information about HiperDispatch, see 3.7, 'Logical partitioning' on page 117.

HiperDispatch manages the number of logical CPs in use. It adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR to achieve the optimal balance between CP resources and the requirements of the workload.



--- Chunk 3537 ---
ispatch manages the number of logical CPs in use. It adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR to achieve the optimal balance between CP resources and the requirements of the workload.

HiperDispatch also adjusts the number of logical processors. The goal is to map the logical processor to as few physical processors as possible. This configuration uses the processor resources more efficiently by trying to stay within the local cache structure. Doing so makes efficient use of the advantages of the high-frequency microprocessors, and improves throughput and response times.

- /SM590000 Dynamic channel path management (DCM)

DCM moves FICON channel bandwidth between disk control units to address current processing needs. IBM z16 systems support DCM within a channel subsystem.

- /SM590000 Channel subsystem priority queuing



--- Chunk 3538 ---
 moves FICON channel bandwidth between disk control units to address current processing needs. IBM z16 systems support DCM within a channel subsystem.

- /SM590000 Channel subsystem priority queuing

This function on IBM z16 and IBM Z allows the priority queuing of I/O requests in the channel subsystem and the specification of relative priority among LPARs. When running in goal mode, WLM sets the priority for an LPAR and coordinates this activity among clustered LPARs.

For more information about implementing LPAR processor management under IRD, see z/OS Intelligent Resource Director , SG24-5952.

3.9  Clustering technology

Parallel Sysplex is the clustering technology that is used with IBM Z servers. The components of a Parallel Sysplex as implemented within the z/Architecture are shown in Figure 3-22. The example in Figure 3-22 shows one of many possible Parallel Sysplex configurations.

Figure 3-22 shows an IBM z16 model A01system that contains multiple z/OS sysplex partitions. It contains an internal CF, an IBM z15 model T02 system that contains a stand-alone CF, and an IBM z14 model M03 that contains multiple z/OS sysplex partitions.

STP over coupling links provides time synchronization to all systems. Selecting the suitable CF link technology Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR) or Integrate Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR and SR1.1) depends on the system configuration and how distant they are physically.

- /SM590000 Continuous availability: Changes can be introduced, such as software upgrades, one image at a time, while the remaining images continue to process work. For more information, see Parallel Sysplex Application Considerations , SG24-6523.
- /SM590000 High capacity: 1 - 32 z/OS images in a Parallel Sysplex that is operating as a single system.
- /SM590000 Dynamic workload balancing: Because it is viewed as a single logical resource, work can be directed to any operating system image in a Parallel Sysplex cluster that has available capacity.
- /SM590000 Systems management: The architecture defines the infrastructure to satisfy client requirements for continuous availability. It also provides techniques for achieving simplified systems management consistent with this requirement.

ecture defines the infrastructure to satisfy client requirements for continuous availability. It also provides techniques for achieving simplified systems management consistent with this requirement.
- /SM590000 Resource sharing: Several base z/OS components use CF shared storage. This configuration enables sharing of physical resources with significant improvements in cost, performance, and simplified systems management.
- /SM590000 Single logical system: The collection of system images in the Parallel Sysplex is displayed as a single entity to the operator, user, and database administrator. A single system view means reduced complexity from operational and definition perspectives.

 in the Parallel Sysplex is displayed as a single entity to the operator, user, and database administrator. A single system view means reduced complexity from operational and definition perspectives.
- /SM590000 N-2 support: Multiple hardware generations (normally three) are supported in the same Parallel Sysplex. This configuration provides for a gradual evolution of the systems in the Parallel Sysplex without changing all of them simultaneously. Software support for multiple releases or versions also is supported.

Note: Parallel sysplex coupling and timing links connectivity for IBM z16 (M/T 3931) is supported to N-2 generation CPCs (IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14).

Note: Parallel sysplex coupling and timing links connectivity for IBM z16 (M/T 3931) is supported to N-2 generation CPCs (IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14).

Through state-of-the-art cluster technology, the power of multiple images can be harnessed to work in concert on common workloads. The IBM Z Parallel Sysplex cluster takes the commercial strengths of the platform to improved levels of system management, competitive price performance, scalable growth, and continuous availability.

3.9.1  CF Control Code

The LPAR that is running the CFCC can be on IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 systems. For more information about CFCC requirements for supported systems, see 'Coupling facility and CFCC considerations' on page 281.

Consideration: IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 servers cannot coexist in the same sysplex with z13/z13s or earlier generation systems.

- -They provide moving weighted average directory entry and data area residency times, in microseconds.
- -They allow monitoring of effects of cache-unfriendly batch processes, such as image copy, reorganization, and update-intensive workloads.
- -Reclaims from all causes are included in the creation of directory entries or data areas, 'structure alter' contractions or reapportionments, incidental reclaims of data areas that are caused by reclaim of a directory entry, and so on.
- -Residency times are accounted for only at the time of reclaim (not while the cache objects are still in use).
- -Specific deletions of these objects do not factor into the residency time metrics.

- -Specific deletions of these objects do not factor into the residency time metrics.
- -These metrics were implemented as new fields within the CF Storage Class controls:

They are retrieved by using the IXLCACHE READ\_STGSTATS command or IXLMG/IXLYAMDA services that are requesting CF Storage Class controls.

They are also available in CF structure memory dumps that capture CF Storage Class controls.

- -The metrics are included in Db2 Performance Manager statistics and used for improved cache structure management (cache sizing, castout processing, reclaim management, and so on). The inclusion of these metrics in sysplex SMF/RMF data is not planned, but can be added later. APAR OA60650 is required on z/OS V2R3, V2R4, and V2R5 to support the new metrics.

- /SM590000 New cache retry buffer support was added for IFCC retry idempotency:

Initially, the CF cache structure architecture was defined to be idempotent (commands can be tried again after link glitches, such as IFCCs); therefore, no specific accommodations were available for retrying, such as retry buffer support.

However, the list structure architecture was always recognized as nonidempotent, and a rather sophisticated retry buffer mechanism was incorporated to allow z/OS to retrieve the results of commands (even after link glitches occurred) so that such glitches always were well recovered.

Over time, constructs were added to the cache and lock structure architecture that made them become not perfectly retriable (nonidempotent), but retry buffers were not added to the architecture to mitigate the lack of retriability:



--- Chunk 3916 ---
to the cache and lock structure architecture that made them become not perfectly retriable (nonidempotent), but retry buffers were not added to the architecture to mitigate the lack of retriability:

- -Cache structure serialization objects, such as castout locks and cache entry version numbers
- -Performance-optimized lock structure commands with no retry buffer support

z/OS software provided simple retry logic to provide IFCC recovery for these nonidempotent commands, but inevitably cases existed ion which z/OS cannot provide unambiguous command results to callers. Users might not handle this ambiguity well.



--- Chunk 3917 ---
provide IFCC recovery for these nonidempotent commands, but inevitably cases existed ion which z/OS cannot provide unambiguous command results to callers. Users might not handle this ambiguity well.

CF cache users who use of these nonidempotent constructs experienced occasional customer problems based on it. The only approach that cleanly and completely addresses the issue is to provide retry buffers for the small subset of cache and lock commands that manipulate objects in a nonidempotent way, along with the accompanying transparent z/OS retry buffer use. z/OS transparently provides all the required recovery support and no user participation is needed.

Down-level systems can continue to use the 'old' software retry support until they are upgraded, while up-level systems that use the same CF structure can take full advantage of the new retry buffers for improved IFCC recovery. APAR OA60275 is required on z/OS V2R2, V2R3, V2R4, and V2R5.

When lock structures use up all of the modify lock 'record data entries' that track held locks, users might need to perform special back-out or recovery processing to recover from this structure full condition. At times, that processing requires them to obtain more 'special' lock structure locks, which are needed to perform the recovery that can lead to a paradoxical situation: They must use more 'record data entries' to recover from being out of record data entries.

CFCC level 25 on IBM z16 is providing improved use support for handling of lock structure 'record data full' conditions by:

CFCC level 25 on IBM z16 is providing improved use support for handling of lock structure 'record data full' conditions by:

- -Thresholding record data structure full conditions to occur when less than 100% full, reserving a special 'for emergency use only' pool of record data entries for critical recovery purposes (user-specified threshold)
- -Providing new APIs that allow exploiters to make use of this new reserved pool only when needed for recovery actions, but not for normal database locking purposes

- /SM590000 DYNDISP=ON|OFF is deprecated on IBM z16, keeping only THIN option for shared-engine CF images.

Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Dedicated processors are recommended for best performance and production use (continuous polling model). Shared processors are recommended for test and development use in which a CF image requires significantly less than one processor's worth of capacity, which encourages sharing CF processors across multiple CF images, or for less-performance critical production usage.

In shared-processor mode, the CF can currently use several different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:

- -DYNDISP=OFF

oss multiple CF images, or for less-performance critical production usage.

In shared-processor mode, the CF can currently use several different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:

- -DYNDISP=OFF

LPAR time-slicing completely controls the CF processor; the processor polls the entire time that it is dispatched to a CF image by LPAR. The CF image never voluntarily gives up control of the shared processor. This option provides the least efficient sharing, and worst shared-engine CF performance.

-DYNDISP=ON

An optimization over pure LPAR time-slicing; the CF image sets timer interrupts to give the LPAR the initiative to redispatch it, and the CF image voluntarily gives up control of the shared processor. This option provides the most efficient sharing, and better shared-engine CF performance.

-DYNDISP=THIN

tive to redispatch it, and the CF image voluntarily gives up control of the shared processor. This option provides the most efficient sharing, and better shared-engine CF performance.

-DYNDISP=THIN

An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts, runs until it runs out of work and then, gives up control voluntarily. This option provides the most efficient sharing, and best overall shared-engine CF performance.

DYNDISP=THIN support to use Thin Interrupts was available since zEC12/zBC12, and proved to be efficient and well-performing in several shared-engine coupling facility configurations. IBM z15 made DYNDISP=THIN the default mode of operation for shared-engine coupling facility images, but supported the other options OFF and ON for continued 'legacy' use.

Note: In IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN option is the only available behavior for shared-engine CF dispatching.

Note: In IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN option is the only available behavior for shared-engine CF dispatching.

Specifying OFF or ON in CF commands and the CF configuration file are preserved for compatibility; however, a warning message is issued to indicate that these options are no longer supported and that DYNDISP=THIN behavior is to be used.

CFCC Level 24

CFCC level 24 is delivered on the IBM z15 (M/T 8561 and 8562) with driver level 41. CFCC level 24 adds the following features:

- /SM590000 CFCC Fair Latch Manager

This feature is an enhancement to the internals of the Coupling Facility (CFCC) dispatcher to provide CF work management efficiency and processor scalability improvements, and improve the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks.

g Facility (CFCC) dispatcher to provide CF work management efficiency and processor scalability improvements, and improve the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks.

The tasks that are waiting for CF latches are not placed on the global suspend queue at all; instead, they are placed on latch-specific waiter queues for the exact instance of the latch they are requesting, and in the exact order in which they requested the latch. As a result, the global suspend queue is much less heavily used, and thus is much less a source of global contention or cache misses in the CF.



--- Chunk 3926 ---
 in the exact order in which they requested the latch. As a result, the global suspend queue is much less heavily used, and thus is much less a source of global contention or cache misses in the CF.

Also, when a latch is released, the specific latch's latch waiter queue is used to transfer ownership of the latch directly to the next request in line (or multiple requests, in the case of a shared latch), and make that task (or tasks) ready to run, with the transferred latch already held. No possibility exists of any unfairness or 'cutters' in line between the time that the latch is released versus when is obtained again.

For managing latches correctly for structures that are System-Managed (SM) synchronous duplexing, it is now important for the CF to understand which of the duplexed pair of requests operates as the 'master' versus 'slave' from a latching perspective, which requires more SM duplexing setup information from z/OS.

- /SM590000 Message Path SYID Resiliency Enhancement

When a z/OS system IPLs, message paths are supposed to be deactivated by using system reset, and their SYIDs are supposed to be cleared in the process. During the IPL, z/OS then reactivates the message paths with a new SYID that represents the new instance of z/OS that uses the paths.

On rare occasions, a message path might not be deactivated during system reset or IPL processing, which leaves the message path active with the z/OS image's OLD, now-obsolete SYID. Because the path erroneously remained active, z/OS does not see any need to reactivate it with a new, correct SYID.



--- Chunk 3928 ---
which leaves the message path active with the z/OS image's OLD, now-obsolete SYID. Because the path erroneously remained active, z/OS does not see any need to reactivate it with a new, correct SYID.

From the perspective of the CF, the incorrect SYID persists and prevents delivery of signals to the z/OS image that uses that message path.

With IBM z15, CFCC provides a new resiliency mechanism that transparently recovers for this 'missing' message path deactivate (if and when that situation ever occurs).

The CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active; namely, the current SYID with which the message path is registered in the CF. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness. If an obsolete or incorrect SYID exists in the message path for any reason, z/OS performs the following steps:



--- Chunk 3929 ---
essage paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness. If an obsolete or incorrect SYID exists in the message path for any reason, z/OS performs the following steps:

- i. Requests nondisruptive gathering of diagnostic information for the affected message paths and CF image.
- ii. Reactivates the message path with the correct SYID for the current z/OS image to seamlessly correct the problem.

This enhancement requires z/OS XCF/XES use APAR support for IBM z15.

- -DYNDISP=OFF: LPAR time-slicing completely controls the CF processor. The processor polls the entire time that it is dispatched by LPAR, and it is idle (not dispatched) when undispatched by LPAR. The result is least efficient sharing, worst shared-engine performance.
- -DYNDISP=ON: An optimization over pure LPAR time slicing, in which the CFCC code judiciously sets timer interrupts to give LPAR the initiative to redispatch it, and the CF sometimes voluntarily gives up control of the shared processor when it runs out of work to do. The result is more efficient sharing and better shared-engine performance. This setting is the default setting for CF LPAR running on IBM z15.

 of the shared processor when it runs out of work to do. The result is more efficient sharing and better shared-engine performance. This setting is the default setting for CF LPAR running on IBM z15.
- -DYNDISP=THIN: An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts and runs until it runs out of things to do and then, gives up control voluntarily (until the next interrupt causes it to get dispatched again). This model is the most efficient sharing, best shared-engine performance.

Thin Interrupt support is available since zEC12/zBC12, and proved to be efficient and performant in numerous different test and customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations.

For CFCC running on IBM z15, DYNDISP=THIN is now the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.

For CFCC running on IBM z15, DYNDISP=THIN is now the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.

- /SM590000 CF monopolization avoidance

With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher monitors in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a specific structure on a structure by structure basis.

When the number of CF tasks that are used by any structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks is also exceeded, the structure is considered to be 'monopolizing' the CF, and z/OS is informed of this monopolization.

New support in z/OS observes the monopolization state for a structure, and starts to selectively queue and throttle incoming requests to the CF, on a structure-specific basis while other requests for other 'nonmonopolizing' structures and workloads are unaffected.



--- Chunk 4132 ---
ure, and starts to selectively queue and throttle incoming requests to the CF, on a structure-specific basis while other requests for other 'nonmonopolizing' structures and workloads are unaffected.

z/OS dynamically manages the queue of requests for the 'monopolizing' structures to limit the number of active CF requests (parallelism) to them. It monitors the monopolization state information of the CF to observe the structure becoming 'nonmonopolized' again so that request processing can eventually revert to a nonthrottled mode of operation.

The overall goal of z/OS anti-monopolization support is to protect the ability of ALL well-behaved structures and workloads to access the CF, and get their requests processed in the CF in a timely fashion while implementing queuing and throttling mechanisms in z/OS to hold back the specific abusive workloads that are causing problems for other workloads.

- /SM590000 Asynchronous cross-invalidate (XI) of CF cache structures. Requires PTF support for z/OS and explicit data manager support (Db2 V12 with PTFs). Consider the following points:
- -Instead of performing XI signals synchronously on every cache update request that causes them, data managers can 'opt in' for the CF to perform these XIs asynchronously (and then sync them up with the CF at or before transaction completion). Data integrity is maintained if all XI signals complete by the time transaction locks are released.
- -Results in faster completion of cache update CF requests, especially with cross-site distance involved.
- -Provides improved cache structure service times and coupling efficiency.
- /SM590000 Coupling Facility hang detect enhancements provide a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability:


--- Chunk 4334 ---
 /SM590000 Coupling Facility hang detect enhancements provide a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability:
- -When a hang is detected, in most cases the CF confines the scope of the failure to 'structure damage' for the single CF structure the hung command was processing against, capture diagnostics with a nondisruptive CF memory dump, and continue operating without ending or restarting the CF image.
- -Provides a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability.
- /SM590000 Coupling Facility ECR granular latching:
- -With this support, most CF list and lock structure ECR processing no longer use structure-wide latching. It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use.
- -Eliminates the performance degradation that is caused by structure-wide latching.

latching. It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use.
- -Eliminates the performance degradation that is caused by structure-wide latching.
- -A few 'edge conditions' in ECR processing still require structure-wide latching to be used to serialize them.

- -Cache structure ECR processing continues to require and use structure-wide latches for its serialization.

- -CF structure encryption
- CF Structure encryption is transparent to middleware and applications that use CFs, while CF users are unaware of and not involved in the encryption. All data and adjunct data that flows between z/OS and the CF is encrypted. The intent is to encrypt all data that might be sensitive.

Internal control information and related request metadata is not encrypted, including locks and lock structures.

z/OS generates the required structure-related encryption keys and does much of the key management automatically by using CFRM that uses secure, protected keys (never clear keys). Secure keys maintained in CFRM couple data set.

--- Chunk 4539 ---
rade from one CFCC level to the next, different levels of CFCC can be run concurrently while the CF LPARs are running on different servers. CF LPARs that run on the same server share the CFCC level.

IBM z16 servers (CFCC level 25) can coexist in a sysplex with CFCC levels 24, 23, and 22; nevertheless, the latest Coupling Facility Control Code and MCLs levels are always recommended for best performance and availability:

- /SM590000 On IBM z15 (M/T 8561 and 8562): CFCC 24 - Service level 00.22, Bundle S48 released in August 2021.
- /SM590000 On IBM z14 (M/T 3906): CFCC 23 - Service Level 00.20, Bundle S64 released in August 2021.

For a CF LPAR with dedicated processors, the CFCC is implemented by using the active wait technique. This technique means that the CFCC is always running (processing or searching for service) and never enters a wait state. Therefore, the CF Control Code uses all the processor capacity that is available for the CF LPAR.



--- Chunk 4540 ---
that the CFCC is always running (processing or searching for service) and never enters a wait state. Therefore, the CF Control Code uses all the processor capacity that is available for the CF LPAR.

If the LPAR that is running the CFCC includes only dedicated processors (CPs or ICFs), the use of all processor capacity (cycles) is not an issue. However, this configuration can be an issue if the LPAR that is running the CFCC includes shared processors. On IBM z16, Thin Interrupts is the only valid option for shared engines in a CF LPAR (Thin Interrupts is the default option on IBM z15).

Performance consideration: Dedicated processor CF still provides the best CF image performance for production environments.

CF structure sizing changes are expected when moving to CFCC Level 25. Always review the CF structure size by using the CFSizer tool when changing CFCC levels.

formance for production environments.

CF structure sizing changes are expected when moving to CFCC Level 25. Always review the CF structure size by using the CFSizer tool when changing CFCC levels.

For more information about the recommended CFCC levels, see the current exception letter that is published on IBM Resource Linkfi.

3.9.2  Coupling Thin Interrupts

CFCC Level 19 introduced Coupling Thin Interrupts to improve performance in environments that share CF engines. Although dedicated engines are preferable to obtain the best CF performance, Coupling Thin Interrupts helps facilitate the use of a shared pool of engines, which helps to lower hardware acquisition costs.



--- Chunk 4542 ---
gh dedicated engines are preferable to obtain the best CF performance, Coupling Thin Interrupts helps facilitate the use of a shared pool of engines, which helps to lower hardware acquisition costs.

The interrupt causes a shared logical processor CF partition to be dispatched by PR/SM (if it is not already dispatched), which allows the request or signal to be processed in a more timely manner. The CF relinquishes control when work is exhausted or when PR/SM takes the physical processor away from the logical processor.

On IBM z16, the use of Coupling Thin Interrupts (DYNDISP=THIN) is now the only option that is available for shared engines in a CF LPAR. Specification of OFF or ON in CF commands and the CF configuration file will be preserved, for compatibility, but a warning message will be issued to indicate that these options are no longer supported, and that DYNDISP=THIN behavior will be used.

preserved, for compatibility, but a warning message will be issued to indicate that these options are no longer supported, and that DYNDISP=THIN behavior will be used.

3.9.3  Dynamic CF dispatching

With the introduction of the Coupling Thin Interrupt support (only available option on IBM z16), which is used only when the CF partition uses shared engines, the CFCC code is changed to handle these interrupts correctly. CFCC was also changed to relinquish voluntarily control of the processor whenever it runs out of work to do. It relies on Coupling Thin Interrupts to dispatch the image again in a timely fashion when new work (or new signals) arrives at the CF to be processed.

With IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN is the only mode of operation for CF images that use shared processors.



--- Chunk 4544 ---
 image again in a timely fashion when new work (or new signals) arrives at the CF to be processed.

With IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN is the only mode of operation for CF images that use shared processors.

This capability allows ICF engines to be shared by several CF images. In this environment, it provides faster and far more consistent CF service times. It can also provide performance that is reasonably close to dedicated-engine CF performance.

The use of Thin Interrupts allows a CF to run by using a shared processor while maintaining good performance. The shared engine is allowed to be undispatched when no more work exists, as in the past. The Thin Interrupt gets the shared processor that is dispatched when a command or duplexing signal is presented to the shared engine.

This function saves processor cycles and is an excellent option to be used by a production backup CF or a testing environment CF. This function is activated by default when a CF processor is shared.

3.10  Virtual Flash Memory

Flash Express is not supported on IBM z16. This feature was replaced by IBM Z Virtual Flash Memory (VFM), from IBM z14. The Virtual Flash Memory feature code is 0644 on IBM z16 A01.

14. The Virtual Flash Memory feature code is 0644 on IBM z16 A01.

3.10.1  IBM Z Virtual Flash Memory overview

VFM replaced the PCIe Flash Express feature with support that is based on main memory.

The 'storage class memory' that is provided by Flash Express adapters is replaced with memory that is allocated from main memory (VFM).

VFM helps improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when running z/OS. With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM across transitional workload events, such as market openings and diagnostic data collection.

z/OS also helps improve processor performance by supporting middleware use of pageable large (1 MB) pages, and eliminates delays that can occur when collecting diagnostic data during failures.

VFM also can be used in CF images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.

3.10.2  VFM feature



--- Chunk 4547 ---
agnostic data during failures.

VFM also can be used in CF images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.

3.10.2  VFM feature

A VFM feature (FC 0644) is 512 GB of memory on IBM z16 A01. The maximum number of VFM features is 12 per IBM z16 A01 system.

Ordered VFM memory reduces the maximum orderable memory for the model.

Simplification in its management is of great value because no hardware adapter is needed to manage. It also has no hardware repair and verify. It has a better performance because no I/O to attached adapter occurs. Finally, because this feature is part of memory, it is protected by RAIM and ECC.

VFM provides physical memory DIMMs that are needed to support activation of all customer purchased memory and HSA on a multiple drawer IBM z16 A01 with one drawer that is done for the following features:



--- Chunk 4548 ---
rovides physical memory DIMMs that are needed to support activation of all customer purchased memory and HSA on a multiple drawer IBM z16 A01 with one drawer that is done for the following features:

- /SM590000 Scheduled concurrent drawer upgrade, such as memory adds
- /SM590000 Scheduled concurrent drawer maintenance, such N+1 repair
- /SM590000 Concurrent repair of an out-of-service CPC drawer 'fenced' during Activation (POR)

Note: All of these features can be done without VFM. However, all customer-purchased memory is not available for use in most cases. Some work might need to be shut down or not restarted.

3.10.3  VFM administration

The allocation and definition information of VFM for all partitions is viewed through the Storage Information panel that is under the Operational Customization panel.

3.10.3  VFM administration

The allocation and definition information of VFM for all partitions is viewed through the Storage Information panel that is under the Operational Customization panel.

The information is relocated during CDR in a manner that is identical to the process that was used for expanded storage. VFM is much simpler to manage (HMC task) and no hardware repair and verify (no cables and no adapters) are needed. Also, because this feature is part of internal memory, VFM is protected by RAIM and ECC and can provide better performance because no I/O to an attached adapter occurs.

Note: Use cases for Flash did not change (for example, z/OS paging and CF shared queue overflow). Instead, they transparently benefit from the changes in the hardware implementation.

No option is available for VFM plan ahead. The only option is to always include VFM plan ahead when Flexible Memory option is selected.

3.11  IBM Secure Service Container

Client applications are subject to several security risks in a production environment. These risks might include external risks (cyber hacker attacks) or internal risks (malicious software, system administrators that use their privileged rights for unauthorized access and many others).

The IBM Secure Service Container (SSC) is a container technology through which you can more quickly and securely deploy software appliances on IBM z16.

An IBM SSC partition is a specialized container for installing and running specific appliances. An appliance is an integration of operating system, middleware, and software components that work autonomously and provide core services and infrastructures that focus on usability and security.



--- Chunk 4551 ---
es. An appliance is an integration of operating system, middleware, and software components that work autonomously and provide core services and infrastructures that focus on usability and security.

IBM SSC hosts most sensitive client workloads and applications. It acts as a highly protected and secured digital vault, enforcing security by encrypting the entire stack: memory, network, and data (both in-flight and at-rest). Applications that are running inside IBM SSC are isolated and protected from outsider and insider threats.

IBM SSC combines hardware, software, and middleware and is unique to IBM Z platform. Though it is called a container, it should not be confused with purely software open source containers (such as Kubernetes or Docker).

IBM SSC is a part of the Pervasive Encryption concept that was introduced with IBM z14, which is aimed at delivering best IBM Security hardware and software enhancements, services, and practices for 360-degree infrastructure protection.

4.1.2  PCIe Generation 3

The PCIe Generation 3 uses 128b/130b encoding for data transmission. This configuration reduces the encoding overhead to approximately 1.54% versus the PCIe Generation 2 overhead of 20% that uses 8b/10b encoding.

The PCIe standard uses a low-voltage differential serial bus. Two wires are used for signal transmission, and a total of four wires (two for transmit and two for receive) form a lane of a PCIe link, which is full-duplex. Multiple lanes can be aggregated into a larger link width. PCIe supports link widths of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32 lanes (x1, x2, x4, x8, x12, x16, and x32).

The data transmission rate of a PCIe link is determined by the link width (numbers of lanes), the signaling rate of each lane, and the signal encoding rule. The signaling rate of one PCIe Generation 3 lane is eight gigatransfers per second (GTps), which means that nearly 8 gigabits are transmitted per second (Gbps).

Note: I/O infrastructure for IBM z16, as for IBM z15, is implemented as PCIe Generation 3. The PU chip PCIe interface is PCIe Generation 4 (x16 @32 GBps), but the CPC I/O fan-out infrastructure provides external connectivity as PCIe Generation 3 @16GBps

A PCIe Gen3 x16 link features the following data transmission rates:



--- Chunk 5029 ---
 Generation 4 (x16 @32 GBps), but the CPC I/O fan-out infrastructure provides external connectivity as PCIe Generation 3 @16GBps

A PCIe Gen3 x16 link features the following data transmission rates:

- /SM590000 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per lane:
- 8 Gbps * 128/130 bit (encoding) = 7.87 Gbps=984.6 MBps
- /SM590000 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per link:

984.6 MBps * 16 (lanes) = 15.75 GBps

Considering that the PCIe link is full-duplex mode, the data throughput rate of a PCIe Gen3 x16 link is 31.5 GBps (15.75 GBps in both directions).

Link performance: The link speeds do not represent the performance of the link. The performance depends on many factors, including latency through the adapters, cable lengths, and the type of workload.

PCIe Gen3 x16 links are used in IBM z16 servers for driving the PCIe+ I/O drawers, and for coupling links for CPC to CPC communications.

rough the adapters, cable lengths, and the type of workload.

PCIe Gen3 x16 links are used in IBM z16 servers for driving the PCIe+ I/O drawers, and for coupling links for CPC to CPC communications.

Note: Unless specified otherwise, PCIe refers to PCIe Generation 3 in remaining sections of this chapter.

4.2  I/O system overview

The IBM z16 I/O characteristics and supported features are described in this section.

4.2.1  Characteristics

The IBM z16 A01 I/O subsystem provides great flexibility, high availability, and the following excellent performance characteristics:

- /SM590000 High bandwidth

IBM z16 servers use PCIe Gen3 protocol to drive PCIe+ I/O drawers and CPC to CPC (coupling) connections. The I/O bus infrastructure data rate of up to 128 GBps 1  per system (12 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out slots).

For more information about coupling link connectivity, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187.



--- Chunk 5031 ---
nfrastructure data rate of up to 128 GBps 1  per system (12 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out slots).

For more information about coupling link connectivity, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187.

- /SM590000 Connectivity options:
- -IBM z16 servers can be connected to an extensive range of interfaces, such as FICON/FCP for SAN connectivity, OSA features for LAN connectivity, and zHyperLink Express for storage connectivity (low latency compared to FICON).
- -For CPC to CPC connections, IBM z16 servers use Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA SR and ICA SR 1.1) and the Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR).
- The Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand is not supported.
- -The 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express3, 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express2.1, and 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE Express2 provide high-speed memory-to-memory data exchange to a remote CPC by using the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) protocol for TCP (socket-based) communications.



--- Chunk 5032 ---
and 10 GbE RoCE Express2 provide high-speed memory-to-memory data exchange to a remote CPC by using the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) protocol for TCP (socket-based) communications.

The RoCE Express3 features also can provide local area network (LAN) connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.

- /SM590000 Concurrent I/O upgrade

You can concurrently add I/O features to IBM z16 servers if unused I/O slot positions are available.

- /SM590000 Concurrent PCIe+ I/O drawer upgrade

More PCIe+ I/O drawers can be installed concurrently if free frame slots for the PCIe+ I/O drawers and PCIe fan-outs in the CPC drawer are available.

- /SM590000 Dynamic I/O configuration



--- Chunk 5033 ---
 upgrade

More PCIe+ I/O drawers can be installed concurrently if free frame slots for the PCIe+ I/O drawers and PCIe fan-outs in the CPC drawer are available.

- /SM590000 Dynamic I/O configuration

Dynamic I/O configuration supports the dynamic addition, removal, or modification of the channel path, control units, and I/O devices without a planned outage.

- /SM590000 Remote Dynamic I/O Activation

Remote dynamic I/O activation is supported for CPCs running Stand-alone CFs, Linux on Z and z/TPF. IBM z14 GA2 provided a remote Dynamic I/O capability for driving hardware-only I/O configuration changes from a 'driving' instance of z/OS Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) on one CPC to a remote 'target' standalone Coupling Facility CPC.

IBM z16 provides a supported capability to drive these same kinds of hardware-only changes from a driving z/OS HCD instance to a remote CPC which is not a standalone Coupling facility, but rather a CPC which hosts Linux on Z and /or z/TPF images.



--- Chunk 5034 ---
 these same kinds of hardware-only changes from a driving z/OS HCD instance to a remote CPC which is not a standalone Coupling facility, but rather a CPC which hosts Linux on Z and /or z/TPF images.

This new support is applicable only when both, the driving CPC and the target CPC are z16 with the required firmware support (Bundle S24 or higher) and the driving systems z/OS is at level 2.3 or higher with APAR OA65559.

- /SM590000 Pluggable optics:
- -The following features include Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) optics 2 :
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; FICON Express32S
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; FICON Express16SA
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; FICON Express16S+

- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; OSA Express7S (including OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR 1.1)
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; OSA Express6S, RoCE Express3
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express2.1
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express2
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express



--- Chunk 5035 ---
 Express7S (including OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR 1.1)

- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express2.1
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express2
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RoCE Express

These optics allow each channel to be individually serviced in a fiber optic module failure. The traffic on the other channels on the same feature can continue to flow if a channel requires servicing.

- -The zHyperLink Express feature uses fiber optics cable with MTP 3  connector and the cable uses a CXP connection to the adapter. The CXP 4  optics are provided with the adapter.
- /SM590000 Concurrent I/O card maintenance

Every I/O card that is plugged in a PCIe+ I/O drawer supports concurrent card replacement during a repair action.

4.3  PCIe+ I/O drawer

The PCIe+ I/O drawers (see Figure 4-1) are attached to the CPC drawer through a PCIe cable and use PCIe Gen3 as the infrastructure bus within the drawer. The PCIe Gen3 I/O bus infrastructure data rate is up to 16 GBps.

<!-- missing-text -->

PCIe switch application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are used to fan out the host bus from the CPC drawer through the PCIe+ I/O drawer to the individual I/O features. Maximum 16 PCIe I/O features (up to 32 channels) per PCIe+ I/O drawer are supported.

are used to fan out the host bus from the CPC drawer through the PCIe+ I/O drawer to the individual I/O features. Maximum 16 PCIe I/O features (up to 32 channels) per PCIe+ I/O drawer are supported.

The PCIe+ I/O drawer is a one-sided drawer (all I/O cards on one side, in the rear of the drawer) that is 8U high. The PCIe+ I/O drawer contains the 16 I/O slots for PCIe features, two switch cards, and two power supply units (PSUs) to provide redundant power, as shown in Figure 4-1.

The PCIe+ I/O drawer slots numbers are shown in Figure 4-2.

<!-- missing-text -->

The I/O structure in an IBM z16 CPC is shown in Figure 4-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

The PCIe switch card provides the fan-out from the high-speed x16 PCIe host bus to eight individual card slots. The PCIe switch card is connected to the CPC drawer through a single x16 PCIe Gen3 bus from a PCIe fan-out card (PCIe+ fan-out cards on IBM z16 have two PCIe Gen3 x16 ports/busses/links).

In the PCIe+ I/O drawer, the eight I/O feature cards that directly attach to the switch card constitute an I/O domain. The PCIe+ I/O drawer supports concurrent add and replace I/O features with which you can increase I/O capability as needed, depending on the CPC drawer.

The PCIe slots in a PCIe+ I/O drawer are organized into two I/O domains. Each I/O domain supports up to eight features and is driven through a PCIe switch card. Two PCIe switch cards always provide a backup path for each other through the passive connection in the PCIe+ I/O drawer backplane.

During a PCIe fan-out card or cable failure, 16 I/O cards in two domains can be driven through a single PCIe switch card. It is not possible to drive 16 I/O cards after one of the PCIe switch cards is removed.

Ie fan-out card or cable failure, 16 I/O cards in two domains can be driven through a single PCIe switch card. It is not possible to drive 16 I/O cards after one of the PCIe switch cards is removed.

The two switch cards are interconnected through the PCIe+ I/O drawer board (Redundant I/O Interconnect, or RII). In addition, switch cards in same PCIe+ I/O drawer are connected to PCIe fan-outs across clusters in CPC drawer for higher availability.

The RII design provides a failover capability during a PCIe fan-out card failure. Both domains in one of these PCIe+ I/O drawers are activated with two fan-outs. The Base Management Cards (BMCs) are used for system control.

The domains and their related I/O slots are shown in Figure 4-2 on page 152.

Each I/O domain supports up to eight features (FICON, OSA, Crypto, and so on.) All I/O cards connect to the PCIe switch card through the backplane board. The I/O domains and slots are listed in Table 4-1.

4.4  CPC drawer fan-outs

The IBM z16 server uses PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out cards to connect the I/O subsystem in the CPC drawer to the PCIe+ I/O drawers. The fan-out cards also include the ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) coupling links for Parallel Sysplex. All fan-out cards support concurrent add, remove, and move.

The IBM z16 CPC drawer I/O infrastructure consists of the following features:

- /SM590000 The PCIe+ Generation 3 fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to PCIe+ I/O drawers.
- /SM590000 ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to other (external) CPCs.

Note: IBM z16 does not support Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand (PSIFB) links.



--- Chunk 5444 ---
 /SM590000 ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to other (external) CPCs.

Note: IBM z16 does not support Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand (PSIFB) links.

Also, if and IBM z16 is part of a Parallel Sysplex or Coordinated Timing Network, InfiniBand links cannot be used on older servers, even if installed.

Unless otherwise noted, ICA SR is used for ICA SR and ICA SR1.1 for the rest of the chapter.

The PCIe fan-outs cards are installed in the rear of the CPC drawers. Each CPC drawer features 12 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out slots.

The PCIe fan-outs and ICA SR fan-outs are installed in locations LG01 - LG12 at the rear in the CPC drawers (see Figure 2-8 on page 25).

On the CPC drawer, two BMC/OSC cards are available, each being a combination of a Base Management (BMC) card and an Oscillator Card (OSC) card. Each BMC/OSC card features one PPS port and one ETS port (RJ45 Ethernet) for both PTP and NTP.

4.4.1  PCIe+ Generation 3 fan-out (FC 0175)

The PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out card provides connectivity to a PCIe+ I/O drawer by using a copper cable. This PCIe fan-out card supports a link rate of 16 GBps (with two links per card).

A 16x PCIe copper cable of 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) - 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) is used for connection to the PCIe switch card in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. PCIe fan-out cards are always plugged in pairs and provide redundancy for I/O domains within the PCIe+ I/O drawer.

Note: The PCIe fan-out is used exclusively for I/O and cannot be shared for any other purpose.

Note: The PCIe fan-out is used exclusively for I/O and cannot be shared for any other purpose.

4.4.2  Integrated Coupling Adapter (FC 0172 and FC 0176)

The IBM ICA SR (FC 0172) is a two-port fan-out feature that is used for short distance coupling connectivity and uses channel type CS5. For IBM z16, the new build feature is ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176).

The ICA SR (FC 0172) and ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176) use PCIe Gen3 technology, with x16 lanes that are bifurcated into x8 lanes for coupling.

Both cards are designed to drive distances up to 150 meters (492 feet) with a link data rate of 8 GBps. ICA SR supports up to four channel-path identifiers (CHPIDs) per port and eight subchannels (devices) per CHPID.

The coupling links can be defined as shared between images (z/OS) within a CSS. They also can be spanned across multiple CSSs in a CPC. For ICA SR features, a maximum four CHPIDs per port can be defined.

oupling links can be defined as shared between images (z/OS) within a CSS. They also can be spanned across multiple CSSs in a CPC. For ICA SR features, a maximum four CHPIDs per port can be defined.

When STP 5  (FC 1021) is available, ICA SR coupling links can be defined as timing-only links to other IBM z16, IBM z15, IBM z14 ZR1, or IBM z14 M0x systems. The ICA SR cannot be connected to InfiniBand coupling fan-outs.

These two fan-out features are housed in the PCIe+ Gen3 I/O fan-out slot on the IBM z16 CPC drawers. Up 48 ICA SR and ICA SR1.1 features (up to 96 ports) are supported on an IBM z16 A01 system.

OM3 fiber optic can be used for distances up to 100 meters (328 feet). OM4 fiber optic cables can be used for distances up to 150 meters (492 feet). For more information, see the following publications:

4.4.3  Fan-out considerations

Fan-out slots in the CPC drawer can be used to plug different fan-outs. On IBM z16 A01, the CPC drawers can hold up to 48 PCIe fan-out cards (four-CPC drawers configuration).

Adapter ID number assignment

PCIe fan-outs and ports are identified by an Adapter ID (AID) that is initially dependent on their physical locations, which is unlike channels that are installed in a PCIe+ I/O drawer. Those channels are identified by a physical channel ID (PCHID) number that is related to their physical location. This AID must be used to assign a CHPID to the fan-out in the IOCDS definition. The CHPID assignment is done by associating the CHPID to an AID port (see Table 4-2.

Fan-out slots

The fan-out slots are numbered LG01 - LG12 (from left to right), as listed in Table 4-2. All fan-out locations and their AIDs for the CPC drawer are shown for reference only.

Important: The AID numbers that are listed in Table 4-2 are valid for a new build system only. If a fan-out is moved, the AID follows the fan-out to its new physical location.

The AID assignment is listed in the PCHID REPORT that is provided for each new server or for an MES upgrade on servers. Part of a PCHID REPORT for an IBM z16 is shown in Example 4-1 on page 157. In this example, four fan-out cards are installed at locations A10/LG06, A15/LG06, A15/LG12, and A15/LG12 with AIDs 05, 11, and PCHIDs 100, 101, and 10C, respectively.

4.5  I/O features

I/O features (adapters) include ports 6  to connect the IBM z16 to external devices, networks, or other servers. I/O features are plugged into the PCIe+ I/O drawer, based on the configuration rules for the server. Different types of I/O cards are available: one for each channel or link type. I/O cards can be installed or replaced concurrently.

- b. Installed in the CPC Drawer; provides coupling connectivity (short distance: up to 150m).

Coupling links connectivity support: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 z13 and z13s and older systems are not supported in same Parallel Sysplex or STP CTN with IBM z16.
- /SM590000 InfiniBand coupling links (if available on IBM z14 M0x) are not supported in a Parallel Sysplex or CTN with an IBM z16 member.

- /SM590000 InfiniBand coupling links (if available on IBM z14 M0x) are not supported in a Parallel Sysplex or CTN with an IBM z16 member.

4.5.2  Physical channel ID report

A physical channel ID (PCHID) reflects the physical location of a channel-type interface. A PCHID number is based on the following factors:

- /SM590000 PCIe+ I/O drawer location
- /SM590000 Channel feature slot number
- /SM590000 Port number of the channel feature

A CHPID does not directly correspond to a hardware channel port. Instead, it is assigned to a PCHID in the hardware configuration definition (HCD) or IOCP.

A PCHID REPORT is created for each new build server and for upgrades on servers. The report lists all I/O features that are installed, the physical slot location, and the assigned PCHID. A portion of a sample PCHID REPORT is shown in Example 4-2.

The PCHID REPORT that is shown in Example 4-2 includes the following components:

- /SM590000 Feature Code 0176 (Integrated Coupling Adapters (ICA SR1.1) is installed in the CPC drawer (location A10, slot LG06, and A15 LG06), and has AIDs 05 and 11 assigned.
- /SM590000 Feature 0461 (FICON Express32SA LX) is installed in PCIe+ I/O drawer 1: Location Z01B, slot 02 with PCHIDs 100/D1 and 101/D2 assigned.
- /SM590000 Two feature codes 0457 (OSA-Express7S 1.2 10 GbE SR) installed in PCIe+ I/O drawer 1 in slots 05 and 07, with PCHIDs 10C/D1 and 110/D1, respectively.

A resource group (RG) parameter also is shown in the PCHID REPORT for native PCIe features. A balanced plugging of native PCIe features exists between four resource groups (RG1, RG2, RG3, and RG4).

A resource group (RG) parameter also is shown in the PCHID REPORT for native PCIe features. A balanced plugging of native PCIe features exists between four resource groups (RG1, RG2, RG3, and RG4).

The preassigned PCHID number of each I/O port relates directly to its physical location (jack location in a specific slot).

4.6  Connectivity

I/O channels are part of the CSS. They provide connectivity for data exchange between servers, between servers and external control units (CUs) and devices, or between networks.

For more information about connectivity to external I/O subsystems (for example, disks), see 4.6.2, 'Storage connectivity' on page 165.

For more information about communication to LANs, see 4.6.3, 'Network connectivity' on page 173.

Communication between servers is implemented by using CE LR, ICA SR, or channel-to-channel (FICON CTC) connections. For more information, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187.

Connectivity to external I/O subsystems (for example, disks) is provided by FICON channels and zHyperLink 7 .

FICON channels

IBM z16 supports the following FICON features:

- /SM590000 FICON Express32S LX and SX (FC 0461/0462)
- /SM590000 FICON Express16SA LX and SX (FC 0436/0437)

- /SM590000 FICON Express16S+ LX and SX (FC 0427/0428)

The ICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features conform to the following architectures:

- /SM590000 Fibre Connection (FICON)
- /SM590000 High Performance FICON on Z (zHPF)
- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)

The FICON features provide connectivity between any combination of servers, directors, switches, and devices (control units, disks, tapes, and printers) in a SAN.

Each FICON Express feature occupies one I/O slot in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each feature includes two ports, each supporting an LC Duplex connector, with one PCHID and one CHPID that is associated with each port.



--- Chunk 5663 ---
xpress feature occupies one I/O slot in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each feature includes two ports, each supporting an LC Duplex connector, with one PCHID and one CHPID that is associated with each port.

Each FICON Express feature uses SFP (SFP+ for FICON Express16SA and FICON Express32S) optics that allow for concurrent repairing or replacement for each SFP. The data flow on the unaffected channels on the same feature can continue. A problem with one FICON Express port does not require replacement of a complete feature.

Each FICON Express feature also supports cascading, which is the connection of two FICON Directors in succession. This configuration minimizes the number of cross-site connections and helps reduce implementation costs for disaster recovery applications, IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS), and remote copy.

IBM z16 servers support 32 K devices per FICON channel for all FICON features.

IBM z16 servers support 32 K devices per FICON channel for all FICON features.

Each FICON Express channel can be defined independently for connectivity to servers, switches, directors, disks, tapes, and printers, by using the following CHPID types:

- /SM590000 CHPID type FC: The FICON, zHPF, and FCTC protocols are supported simultaneously.
- /SM590000 CHPID type FCP: Fibre Channel Protocol that supports attachment to SCSI devices directly or through Fibre Channel switches or directors.

FICON channels (CHPID type FC or FCP) can be shared among LPARs and defined as spanned. All ports on a FICON feature must be of the same type (LX or SX). The features are connected to a FICON capable control unit (point-to-point or switched point-to-point) through a Fibre Channel switch.

FICON features and built-in functions

Together with the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+, IBM z16 servers provide enhancements for FICON in functional and performance aspects with IBM Endpoint Security solution.

IBM Fibre Channel Endpoint Security

IBM z16 Model A01 supports IBM Fibre Channel Endpoint Security feature (FC 1146). FC 1146 provides FC/FCP link encryption and endpoint authentication. It is an end-to-end solution that helps ensure all data flowing on the Fibre Channel links within and across data centers flows between trusted entities.

Forward Error Correction

Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a technique that is used for reducing data errors when transmitting over unreliable or noisy communication channels (improving signal to noise ratio). By adding redundancy error-correction code (ECC) to the transmitted information, the receiver can detect and correct several errors without requiring retransmission. This process features improve signal reliability and bandwidth use by reducing retransmissions because of bit errors, especially for connections across long distance, such as an inter-switch link (ISL) in a GDPS Metro Mirror environment.



--- Chunk 5672 ---
liability and bandwidth use by reducing retransmissions because of bit errors, especially for connections across long distance, such as an inter-switch link (ISL) in a GDPS Metro Mirror environment.

The FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ support FEC coding on top of its 64b/66b data encoding for 16 and 32 Gbps connections. This design can correct up to 11 bit errors per 2112 bits transmitted.

Therefore, while connected to devices that support FEC at 16 Gbps connections, the FEC design allows FICON Express16SE, FICON Express16S+, and FICON Express16S channels to operate at higher speeds, over longer distances, with reduced power and higher throughput. At the same time, the same reliability and robustness for which FICON channels are traditionally known are maintained.

With the IBM DS8870 or newer, IBM z16 servers can extend the use of FEC to the fabric N\_Ports for a completed end-to-end coverage of 32 Gbps FC links.

With the IBM DS8870 or newer, IBM z16 servers can extend the use of FEC to the fabric N\_Ports for a completed end-to-end coverage of 32 Gbps FC links.

FICON dynamic routing

With the IBM z14 and newer servers, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static SAN routing policies for ISLs for cascaded FICON directors. The IBM Z servers now support dynamic routing in the SAN with the FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR) feature. It is designed to support the dynamic routing policies that are provided by the FICON director manufacturers; for example, Brocade's exchange-based routing (EBR) and Cisco's originator exchange ID (OxID) 8  routing.

A static SAN routing policy normally assigns the ISL routes according to the incoming port and its destination domain (port-based routing), or the source and destination ports pairing (device-based routing).



--- Chunk 5674 ---
SAN routing policy normally assigns the ISL routes according to the incoming port and its destination domain (port-based routing), or the source and destination ports pairing (device-based routing).

The port-based routing (PBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on 'first come, first served' when a port starts a fabric login (FLOGI) to a destination domain. The ISL is round-robin that is selected for assignment. Therefore, I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination domain always is assigned the same ISL route, regardless of the destination port of each I/O.

This setup can result in some ISLs becoming overloaded while some are under-used. The ISL routing table is changed whenever IBM Z server undergoes a power-on-reset (POR), so the ISL assignment is unpredictable.



--- Chunk 5675 ---
an result in some ISLs becoming overloaded while some are under-used. The ISL routing table is changed whenever IBM Z server undergoes a power-on-reset (POR), so the ISL assignment is unpredictable.

Device-based routing (DBR) assigns the ISL routes statically that is based on a hash of the source and destination port. That I/O flow from same incoming port to same destination is assigned to same ISL route. Compared to PBR, the DBR is more capable of spreading the load across ISLs for I/O flow from the same incoming port to different destination ports within a destination domain.

When a static SAN routing policy is used, the FICON director features limited capability to assign ISL routes that are based on workload. This limitation can result in unbalanced use of ISLs (some might be overloaded, while others are under-used).



--- Chunk 5676 ---
ON director features limited capability to assign ISL routes that are based on workload. This limitation can result in unbalanced use of ISLs (some might be overloaded, while others are under-used).

The dynamic routing ISL routes are dynamically changed based on the Fibre Channel exchange ID, which is unique for each I/O operation. ISL is assigned at I/O request time; therefore, different I/Os from same incoming port to same destination port are assigned different ISLs.

With FIDR, IBM z16 servers feature the following advantages for performance and management in configurations with ISL and cascaded FICON directors:

- /SM590000 Support sharing of ISLs between FICON and FCP (PPRC or distributed)
- /SM590000 I/O traffic is better balanced between all available ISLs
- /SM590000 Improved use of FICON director and ISL
- /SM590000 Easier to manage with a predicable and repeatable I/O performance

- /SM590000 Improved use of FICON director and ISL
- /SM590000 Easier to manage with a predicable and repeatable I/O performance

FICON dynamic routing can be enabled by defining dynamic routing-capable switches and control units in HCD. Also, z/OS implemented a health check function for FICON dynamic routing.

Improved zHPF I/O execution at distance

By introducing the concept of pre-deposit writes, zHPF reduces the number of round trips of standard FCP I/Os to a single round trip. Originally, this benefit is limited to writes that are less than 64 KB.

zHPF on IBM z14 and newer servers were enhanced to allow all large write operations (&gt; 64 KB) at distances up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) to be run in a single round trip to the control unit. This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.

Read Diagnostic Parameter Extended Link Service support

gle round trip to the control unit. This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.

Read Diagnostic Parameter Extended Link Service support

To improve the accuracy of identifying a failed component without unnecessarily replacing components in a SAN fabric, a new Extended Link Service (ELS) command called Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) was added to the Fibre Channel T11 standard. This command allows IBM Z servers to obtain extra diagnostic data from the SFP optics that are throughout the SAN fabric.

IBM z14 and newer servers can read this extra diagnostic data for all the ports that are accessed in the I/O configuration and make the data available to an LPAR. For z/OS LPARs that use FICON channels, z/OS displays the data with a new message and display command. For Linux on IBM Z, z/VM, and z/VSE, and LPARs that use FCP channels, this diagnostic data is available in a new window in the SAN Explorer tool.

ays the data with a new message and display command. For Linux on IBM Z, z/VM, and z/VSE, and LPARs that use FCP channels, this diagnostic data is available in a new window in the SAN Explorer tool.

N\_Port ID Virtualization

N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) allows multiple system images (in LPARs or z/VM guests) to use a single FCP channel as though each were the sole user of the channel. First introduced with IBM z9fi EC, this feature can be used with earlier FICON features that were carried forward from earlier servers.

By using the FICON Express16S (or newer) as an FCP channel with NPIV enabled, the maximum numbers of the following aspects for one FCP physical channel are doubled:

By using the FICON Express16S (or newer) as an FCP channel with NPIV enabled, the maximum numbers of the following aspects for one FCP physical channel are doubled:

- /SM590000 Maximum number of remote N\_Ports communicated: Increased from 512 to 1024
- /SM590000 Maximum number of addressable LUNs: Increased from 4096 to 8192
- /SM590000 Concurrent I/O operations: Increased from 764 to 1528

For more information about operating systems that support NPIV, see 'N\_Port ID Virtualization' on page 296.

Export and import physical port WWPNs for FCP Channels

IBM Z automatically assign worldwide port names (WWPNs) to the physical ports of an FCP channel that is based on the PCHID. This WWPN assignment changes when an FCP channel is moved to a different physical slot position.



--- Chunk 5681 ---
sign worldwide port names (WWPNs) to the physical ports of an FCP channel that is based on the PCHID. This WWPN assignment changes when an FCP channel is moved to a different physical slot position.

IBM z14 and newer servers allow for the modification of these default assignments, which also allows FCP channels to keep previously assigned WWPNs, even after being moved to a different slot position. This capability can eliminate the need for reconfiguration of the SAN in many situations, and is especially helpful during a system upgrade (FC 0099 - WWPN Persistence).

FICON support for multiple-hop cascaded SAN configurations

Before the introduction of z13 and z13s servers, IBM Z FICON SAN configurations supported a single ISL (a single hop) in a cascaded FICON SAN environment only.

IBM z14 and newer servers support up to three hops in a cascaded FICON SAN environment. This support allows clients to more easily configure a three- or four-site disaster recovery solution.

The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature (FC 0451) provides a low latency direct connection between IBM z16 and DS8000 storage system.

The zHyperLink Express1.1 is the result of new business requirements that demand fast and consistent application response times.

They then connect at the highest common performance speed and duplex mode of interoperation. If the attached Ethernet router or switch does not support auto-negotiation, the OSA-Express port examines the signal that it is receiving and connects at the speed and duplex mode of the device at the other end of the cable.

The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE, or OSM. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE.

The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE, or OSM. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE.

Note: CHPID types OSM, OSN, and OSX are not supported on IBM z16

The following settings are supported on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature port:

- /SM590000 Auto-negotiate
- /SM590000 100 Mbps half-duplex or full-duplex
- /SM590000 1000 Mbps full-duplex

If auto-negotiate is not used, the OSA-Express port attempts to join the LAN at the specified speed and duplex mode. If this specified speed and duplex mode do not match the speed and duplex mode of the signal on the cable, the OSA-Express port does not connect.

For more information about supported distances, see Table 4-8 on page 179.

Shared Memory Communications Version 1

The following versions of SMC are available:

- /SM590000 SMC-R

SMC-R provides application transparent use of the RoCE-Express feature. This feature reduces the network overhead and latency of data transfers, which effectively offers the benefits of optimized network performance across processors.

- /SM590000 SMC-D

SMC-D was used with the introduction of the Internal Shared Memory (ISM) virtual PCI function. ISM is a virtual PCI network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory, which provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z intra-CPC communications.



--- Chunk 5740 ---
ual PCI function. ISM is a virtual PCI network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory, which provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z intra-CPC communications.

SMC-D maintains the socket-API transparency aspect of SMC-R so that applications that use TCP/IP communications can benefit immediately without requiring any application software or IP topology changes. SMC-D completes the overall SMC solution, which provides synergy with SMC-R.

SMC-R and SMC-D use shared memory architectural concepts, which eliminate the TCP/IP processing in the data path, yet preserves TCP/IP Qualities of Service for connection management purposes.

Internal Shared Memory

ISM is a function that is supported by IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 systems. It provides connectivity by using shared memory access between multiple operating system images within the same CPC. ISM creates virtual adapters with shared memory that is allocated for each operating system image.



--- Chunk 5741 ---
ctivity by using shared memory access between multiple operating system images within the same CPC. ISM creates virtual adapters with shared memory that is allocated for each operating system image.

ISM is defined by the FUNCTION statement with a virtual CHPID (VCHID) in HCD/IOCDS. Identified by the PNETID parameter, each ISM VCHID defines an isolated, internal virtual network for SMC-D communication, without any hardware component required. Virtual adapters are defined by virtual function (VF) statements. Multiple LPARs can access the same virtual network for SMC-D data exchange by associating their VF with same VCHID.

Applications that use HiperSockets can realize network latency and CPU reduction benefits and performance improvement by using the SMC-D over ISM.

IBM z16 servers support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a total maximum of 8,000 VFs.

Shared Memory Communications Version 2

ement by using the SMC-D over ISM.

IBM z16 servers support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a total maximum of 8,000 VFs.

Shared Memory Communications Version 2

Shared Memory Communications v2 is available in z/OS V2R4 (with PTFs) and z/OS V2R5.

The initial version of SMC was limited to TCP/IP connections over the same layer 2 network; therefore, it was not routable across multiple IP subnets. The associated TCP/IP connection was limited to hosts within a single IP subnet that requires the hosts to have direct access to the same physical layer 2 network (that is, the same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet.



--- Chunk 5743 ---
cess to the same physical layer 2 network (that is, the same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet.

SMC Version 2 (SMCv2) provides support for SMC over multiple IP subnets for SMC-D and SMC-R and is referred to as SMC-Dv2 and SMC-Rv2. SMCv2 requires updates to the underlying network technology. SMC-Dv2 requires ISMv2 and SMC-Rv2 requires RoCEv2.

The SMCv2 protocol is downward compatible, which allows SMCv2 hosts to continue to communicate with SMCv1 down-level hosts.

Although SMCv2 changes the SMC connection protocol enabling multiple IP subnet support, SMCv2 does not change how user TCP socket data is transferred, which preserves the benefits of SMC to TCP workloads.

TCP/IP connections that require IPsec are not eligible for any form of SMC.

kloads.

TCP/IP connections that require IPsec are not eligible for any form of SMC.

HiperSockets

The HiperSockets function of IBM z16 servers provides up to 32 high-speed virtual LAN attachments.

HiperSockets can be customized to accommodate varying traffic sizes. Because HiperSockets does not use an external network, it can free up system and network resources. This advantage can help eliminate attachment costs and improve availability and performance.

HiperSockets eliminates the need to use I/O subsystem operations and traverse an external network connection to communicate between LPARs in the same IBM z16 CPC.

HiperSockets offers significant value in server consolidation when connecting many virtual servers. It can be used instead of certain coupling link configurations in a Parallel Sysplex.

HiperSockets internal networks support the following transport modes:

- /SM590000 Layer 2 (link layer)
- /SM590000 Layer 3 (network or IP layer)



--- Chunk 5745 ---
coupling link configurations in a Parallel Sysplex.

HiperSockets internal networks support the following transport modes:

- /SM590000 Layer 2 (link layer)
- /SM590000 Layer 3 (network or IP layer)

Traffic can be IPv4 or IPv6, or non-IP, such as AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA.

HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device (Layer 2 and Layer 3 mode) features its own Media Access Control (MAC) address. This address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of Layer 2 addresses, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers and firewalls.

Layer 2 support helps facilitate server consolidation, and can reduce complexity and simplify network configuration. It also allows LAN administrators to maintain the mainframe network environment similarly to nonmainframe environments.

r consolidation, and can reduce complexity and simplify network configuration. It also allows LAN administrators to maintain the mainframe network environment similarly to nonmainframe environments.

Packet forwarding decisions are based on Layer 2 information instead of Layer 3. The HiperSockets device can run automatic MAC address generation to create uniqueness within and across LPARs and servers. The use of Group MAC addresses for multicast is supported, and broadcasts to all other Layer 2 devices on the same HiperSockets networks.

Datagrams are delivered only between HiperSockets devices that use the same transport mode. A Layer 2 device cannot communicate directly to a Layer 3 device in another LPAR network. A HiperSockets device can filter inbound datagrams by VLAN identification, the destination MAC address, or both.



--- Chunk 5747 ---
yer 2 device cannot communicate directly to a Layer 3 device in another LPAR network. A HiperSockets device can filter inbound datagrams by VLAN identification, the destination MAC address, or both.

Analogous to the Layer 3 functions, HiperSockets Layer 2 devices can be configured as primary or secondary connectors, or multicast routers. This configuration enables the creation of high-performance and high-availability link layer switches between the internal HiperSockets network and an external Ethernet network. It also can be used to connect to the HiperSockets Layer 2 networks of different servers.

HiperSockets Layer 2 is supported by Linux on IBM Z, and by z/VM for Linux guest use.

4.6.4  Parallel Sysplex connectivity

Coupling links are required in a Parallel Sysplex configuration to provide connectivity from the z/OS images to the coupling facility (CF). A properly configured Parallel Sysplex provides a highly reliable, redundant, and robust IBM Z technology solution to achieve near-continuous availability. A Parallel Sysplex is composed of one or more z/OS operating system images that are coupled through one or more CFs.

This section describes coupling link features supported in a Parallel Sysplex in which an IBM z16 can participate.

Coupling links

The type of coupling link that is used to connect a CF to an operating system LPAR is important. The link performance significantly affects response times and coupling processor usage. For configurations that extend over large distances, the time that is spent on the link can be the largest part of the response time.

IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 13  support the following coupling link types:

- /SM590000 Internal Coupling (IC) links are for internal links within a CPC.

Note: Parallel Sysplex supports connectivity between systems that differ by up to two generations (n-2). For example, an IBM z16 can participate in an IBM Parallel Sysplex cluster with IBM z15, and IBM z14 systems.

Internal Coupling link

IC links are Licensed Internal Code-defined links that are used to connect a CF to a z/OS logical partition in the same CPC. These links are available on all IBM Z platforms. The IC link is an IBM Z coupling connectivity option that enables high-speed, efficient communication between a CF partition and one or more z/OS logical partitions that are running on the same CPC. The IC is a linkless connection (implemented in LIC) and does not require any hardware or cabling.

An IC link is a fast coupling link that uses memory-to-memory data transfers. IC links do not have PCHID numbers, but do require CHPIDs.

IC links have the following attributes:

- /SM590000 They provide the fastest connectivity that is significantly faster than external link alternatives.

IC links have the following attributes:

- /SM590000 They provide the fastest connectivity that is significantly faster than external link alternatives.

- /SM590000 They result in better coupling efficiency than with external links, which effectively reduces the CPU cost that is associated with Parallel Sysplex.
- /SM590000 They can be used in test or production configurations, reduce the cost of moving into Parallel Sysplex technology, and enhance performance and reliability.
- /SM590000 They can be defined as spanned channels across multiple channel subsystems.
- /SM590000 They are available at no extra hardware cost (no feature code). Employing ICFs with IC links results in considerable cost savings when configuring a cluster.

IC links are enabled by defining CHPID type ICP. A maximum of 64 IC links can be defined on an IBM z16.

The ICA SR (FC 0172) was introduced with the IBM z13. ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176) was introduced with IBM z15.

ICA SR and ICA SR1.1 are two-port, short-distance coupling features that allow the supported IBM Z to connect to each other. ICA SR and ICA SR1.1 use coupling channel type: CS5.

The ICA SR uses PCIe Gen3 technology, with x16 lanes that are bifurcated into x8 lanes for coupling. ICA SR1.1 uses PCIe Gen4 technology, with x16 lanes that are bifurcated into x8 lanes for coupling.

The ICA SR and SR1.1 are designed to drive distances up to 150 m (492 feet) and supports a link data rate of 8 GBps. It is designed to support up to four CHPIDs per port and eight subchannels (devices) per CHPID.

Migration considerations

Upgrading from previous generations of IBM Z systems in a Parallel Sysplex to IBM z16 servers in that same Parallel Sysplex requires proper planning for coupling connectivity. Planning is important because of the change in the supported type of coupling link adapters and the number of available fan-out slots of the IBM z16 CPC drawers.

The ICA SR fan-out features provide short-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server.

The CE LR adapter provides long-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server.

ut features provide short-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server.

The CE LR adapter provides long-distance connectivity to another IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM z14 server.

The IBM z16 fan-out slots in the CPC drawer provide coupling link connectivity through the ICA SR fan-out cards. In addition to coupling links for Parallel Sysplex, the fan-out cards provide connectivity for the PCIe+ I/O drawer (PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out).

Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards can be installed in an IBM z16 CPC drawer.

Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards can be installed in an IBM z16 CPC drawer.

To migrate from an older generation machine to an IBM z16 without disruption in a Parallel Sysplex environment requires that the older machines are no more than n-2 generation (namely, at least IBM z14) and that they carry enough coupling links to connect to the existing systems while also connecting to the new machine. This requirement is necessary to allow individual components (z/OS LPARs and CFs) to be shut down and moved to the target machine and continue to be connected to the remaining systems.

It is beyond the scope of this book to describe all possible migration scenarios. Always consult with subject matter experts to help you to develop your migration strategy.

e scope of this book to describe all possible migration scenarios. Always consult with subject matter experts to help you to develop your migration strategy.

Coupling links and Server Time Protocol

All external coupling links can be used to pass time synchronization signals by using Server Time Protocol (STP). STP is a message-based protocol in which timing messages are passed over data links between servers. The same coupling links can be used to exchange time and CF messages in a Parallel Sysplex.

The use of the coupling links to exchange STP messages has the following advantages:



--- Chunk 5764 ---
nks between servers. The same coupling links can be used to exchange time and CF messages in a Parallel Sysplex.

The use of the coupling links to exchange STP messages has the following advantages:

- /SM590000 By using the same links to exchange STP messages and CF messages in a Parallel Sysplex, STP can scale with distance. Servers that are exchanging messages over short distances (ICA SR links), can meet more stringent synchronization requirements than servers that exchange messages over long distance (CE2 LR links), with distances up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) 15 . This advantage is an enhancement over the IBM Sysplex Timer implementation, which does not scale with distance.
- /SM590000 Coupling links provide the connectivity that is necessary in a Parallel Sysplex. Therefore, a potential benefit can be realized of minimizing the number of cross-site links that is required in a multi-site Parallel Sysplex.

e connectivity that is necessary in a Parallel Sysplex. Therefore, a potential benefit can be realized of minimizing the number of cross-site links that is required in a multi-site Parallel Sysplex.

Between any two servers that are intended to exchange STP messages, configure each server so that at least two coupling links exist for communication between the servers. This configuration prevents the loss of one link from causing the loss of STP communication between the servers. If a server does not have a CF LPAR, timing-only links can be used to provide STP connectivity.

5.1  Channel subsystem

Channel subsystem (CSS) is a collective name of facilities that IBM Z servers use to control I/O operations.

The channel subsystem directs the flow of information between I/O devices and main storage. It allows data processing to proceeded concurrently with I/O processing, which relieves data processors (central processor (CP) and Integrated Facility for Linux [IFL]) of the task of communicating directly with I/O devices.

The channel subsystem includes subchannels, I/O devices that are attached through control units, and channel paths between the subsystem and control units. For more information about the channel subsystem, see 5.1.1, 'Multiple logical channel subsystems'.



--- Chunk 5809 ---
hat are attached through control units, and channel paths between the subsystem and control units. For more information about the channel subsystem, see 5.1.1, 'Multiple logical channel subsystems'.

The design of IBM Z servers offers considerable processing power, memory size, and I/O connectivity. In support of the larger I/O capability, the CSS structure is scaled up by introducing the multiple logical channel subsystem (LCSS) since IBM z990, and multiple subchannel sets (MSS) since IBM z9.

An overview of the channel subsystem for IBM z16 servers is shown in Figure 5-1. IBM z16 A01 systems are designed to support up to six logical channel subsystems, each with four subchannel sets and up to 256 channels.

BM z16 servers is shown in Figure 5-1. IBM z16 A01 systems are designed to support up to six logical channel subsystems, each with four subchannel sets and up to 256 channels.

<!-- missing-text -->

All channel subsystems are defined within a single configuration, which is called I/O configuration data set (IOCDS). The IOCDS is loaded into the hardware system area (HSA) during a central processor complex (CPC) power-on reset (POR) to start all of the channel subsystems.

On IBM z16 A01 systems, the HSA is pre-allocated in memory with a fixed size of 256 GB, which is in addition to the customer purchased memory. This fixed size memory for HSA eliminates the requirement for more planning of the initial I/O configuration and planning for future I/O expansions.

5.1.1  Multiple logical channel subsystems

In the z/Architecture, a single channel subsystem can have up to 256 channel paths that are defined, which limited the total numbers of I/O connectivity on older IBM Z servers to 256.

el subsystems

In the z/Architecture, a single channel subsystem can have up to 256 channel paths that are defined, which limited the total numbers of I/O connectivity on older IBM Z servers to 256.

The introduction of multiple LCSSs enabled an IBM Z server to have more than one channel subsystems logically, while each logical channel subsystem maintains the same manner of I/O processing. Also, a logical partition (LPAR) is now attached to a specific logical channel subsystem, which makes the extension of multiple logical channel subsystems not apparent to the operating systems and applications. The multiple image facility (MIF) in the structure enables resource sharing across LPARs within a single LCSS or across the LCSSs.

The multiple LCSS structure extended the IBM Z servers' total number of I/O connectivity to support a balanced configuration for the growth of processor and I/O capabilities.

The multiple LCSS structure extended the IBM Z servers' total number of I/O connectivity to support a balanced configuration for the growth of processor and I/O capabilities.

A one-digit number ID starting from 0 (CSSID) is assigned to an LCSS, and a one-digit hexadecimal ID (MIF ID) starting from 0 is assigned to an LPAR within the LCSS.

Note: The phrase channel subsystem has same meaning as logical channel subsystem in this section, unless otherwise stated.

Subchannels

A subchannel provides the logical appearance of a device to the program and contains the information that is required for sustaining a single I/O operation. Each device is accessible by using one subchannel in a channel subsystem to which it is assigned according to the active IOCDS of the IBM Z server.



--- Chunk 5814 ---
is required for sustaining a single I/O operation. Each device is accessible by using one subchannel in a channel subsystem to which it is assigned according to the active IOCDS of the IBM Z server.

A subchannel set (SS) is a collection of subchannels within a channel subsystem. The maximum number of subchannels of a subchannel set determines how many devices are accessible to a channel subsystem.

In z/Architecture, the first subchannel set of an LCSS can have 63.75 K subchannels (with 0.25 K reserved), with a subchannel set ID (SSID) of 0. By enabling the multiple subchannel sets, extra subchannel sets are available to increase the device addressability of a channel subsystem.

For more information about multiple subchannel sets, see 5.1.2, 'Multiple subchannel sets' on page 200.

Channel paths

A channel path provides a connection between the channel subsystem and control units that allows the channel subsystem to communicate with I/O devices. Depending on the type of connections, a channel path might be a physical connection to a control unit with I/O devices, such as FICON, or an internal logical control unit, such as HiperSockets.

Each channel path in a channel subsystem features a unique 2-digit hexadecimal identifier that is known as a channel-path identifier (CHPID), which ranges 00 - FF. Therefore, a total of 256 CHPIDs are supported by a CSS, and a maximum of 1536 CHPIDs are available on an IBM z16 with six logical channel subsystems.

-path identifier (CHPID), which ranges 00 - FF. Therefore, a total of 256 CHPIDs are supported by a CSS, and a maximum of 1536 CHPIDs are available on an IBM z16 with six logical channel subsystems.

By assigning a CHPID to a physical port of an I/O feature adapter, such as FICON Express32S, or a fan-out adapter (ICA SR) port, the channel subsystem connects to the I/O devices through these physical ports.

A port on an I/O feature card features a unique physical channel identifier (PCHID) according to the physical location of this I/O feature adapter, and the sequence of this port on the adapter.

In addition, a port on a fan-out adapter has a unique adapter identifier (AID), according to the physical location of this fan-out adapter, and the sequence of this port on the adapter.

A CHPID is assigned to a physical port by defining the corresponding PCHID or AID in the I/O configuration definitions.

Control units

fan-out adapter, and the sequence of this port on the adapter.

A CHPID is assigned to a physical port by defining the corresponding PCHID or AID in the I/O configuration definitions.

Control units

A control unit provides the logical capabilities that are necessary to operate and control an I/O device. It adapts the characteristics of each device so that it can respond to the standard form of control that is provided by the CSS.

A control unit can be housed separately or can be physically and logically integrated with the I/O device, channel subsystem, or within the IBM Z server.

I/O devices

An I/O device provides external storage, a means of communication between data-processing systems, or a means of communication between a system and its environment. In the simplest case, an I/O device is attached to one control unit and is accessible through one or more channel paths that are connected to the control unit.

ment. In the simplest case, an I/O device is attached to one control unit and is accessible through one or more channel paths that are connected to the control unit.

5.1.2  Multiple subchannel sets

A subchannel set is a collection of subchannels within a channel subsystem. The maximum number of subchannels of a subchannel set determines how many I/O devices that a channel subsystem can access. This number also determines the number of addressable devices to the program (for example, an operating system) that is running in the LPAR.

Each subchannel has a unique four-digit hexadecimal number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF. Therefore, a single subchannel set can address and access up to 64 K I/O devices.

The IBM z16 A01 systems support four subchannel sets for each logical channel subsystem. The IBM z16 A01 system can access a maximum of 255.74 K devices for a logical channel subsystem and a logical partition and the programs that are running on it.

Note: Do not confuse the multiple subchannel sets function with multiple channel subsystems.

Subchannel number

The subchannel number is a four-digit hexadecimal number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF, which is assigned to a subchannel within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem. Subchannels in each subchannel set are always assigned subchannel numbers within a single range of contiguous numbers.

The lowest-numbered subchannel is subchannel 0; the highest-numbered subchannel includes a subchannel number equal to one less than the maximum numbers of subchannels that are supported by the subchannel set. Therefore, a subchannel number is always unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem and depends on the sequence of assigning.



--- Chunk 5820 ---
bers of subchannels that are supported by the subchannel set. Therefore, a subchannel number is always unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem and depends on the sequence of assigning.

With the subchannel numbers, a program that is running on an LPAR (for example, an operating system) can specify all I/O functions relative to a specific I/O device by designating a subchannel that is assigned to the I/O devices.

Normally, subchannel numbers are used only in communication between the programs and the channel subsystem.

Subchannel set identifier

While introducing the MSS, the channel subsystem is extended to assign a value 0 - 3 for each subchannel set, which is the SSID. A subchannel can be identified by its SSID and subchannel number.

Device number



--- Chunk 5821 ---
ducing the MSS, the channel subsystem is extended to assign a value 0 - 3 for each subchannel set, which is the SSID. A subchannel can be identified by its SSID and subchannel number.

Device number

A device number is an arbitrary number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF, which is defined by a system programmer in an I/O configuration for naming an I/O device. The device number must be unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem. It is assigned to the corresponding subchannel by channel subsystem when an I/O configuration is activated. Therefore, a subchannel in a subchannel set of a channel subsystem includes a device number together with a subchannel number for designating an I/O operation.

The device number provides a means to identify a device that is independent of any limitations that are imposed by the system model, configuration, or channel-path protocols.



--- Chunk 5822 ---
ting an I/O operation.

The device number provides a means to identify a device that is independent of any limitations that are imposed by the system model, configuration, or channel-path protocols.

A device number also can be used to designate an I/O function to a specific I/O device. Because it is an arbitrary number, it can easily be fit into any configuration management and operating management scenarios. For example, a system administrator can set all of the z/OS systems in an environment to device number 1000 for their system RES volumes.

With multiple subchannel sets, a subchannel is assigned to a specific I/O device by the channel subsystem with an automatically assigned subchannel number and a device number that is defined by user. An I/O device can always be identified by an SSID with a subchannel number or a device number. For example, a device with device number AB00 of subchannel set 1 can be designated as 1AB00.



--- Chunk 5823 ---
 by user. An I/O device can always be identified by an SSID with a subchannel number or a device number. For example, a device with device number AB00 of subchannel set 1 can be designated as 1AB00.

Normally, the subchannel number is used by the programs to communicate with the channel subsystem and I/O device, whereas the device number is used by a system programmer, operator, and administrator.

Device in subchannel set 0 and extra subchannel sets

An LCSS always includes the first subchannel set (SSID 0), which can have up to 63.75 K subchannels with 256 subchannels that are reserved by the channel subsystem. Users can always define their I/O devices in this subchannel set for general use.

For the extra subchannel sets enabled by the MSS facility, each has 65535 subchannels (64 K minus one) for specific types of devices. These extra subchannel sets are referred as alternative subchannel sets in z/OS.



--- Chunk 5824 ---
bchannel sets enabled by the MSS facility, each has 65535 subchannels (64 K minus one) for specific types of devices. These extra subchannel sets are referred as alternative subchannel sets in z/OS.

Also, a device that is defined in an alternative subchannel set is considered a special device, which normally features a special device type in the I/O configuration.

Currently, an IBM z16 A01 system that is running z/OS defines the following types of devices in another subchannel set, with proper APAR or PTF installed:

- /SM590000 Alias devices of the parallel access volumes (PAV).
- /SM590000 Secondary devices of GDPS Metro Mirror Copy Service (formerly Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy [PPRC]).
- /SM590000 IBM FlashCopyfi SOURCE and TARGET devices with program temporary fix (PTF) OA46900.
- /SM590000 Db2 data backup volumes with PTF OA24142.

- /SM590000 IBM FlashCopyfi SOURCE and TARGET devices with program temporary fix (PTF) OA46900.
- /SM590000 Db2 data backup volumes with PTF OA24142.

The use of another subchannel set for these special devices helps reduce the number of devices in the subchannel set 0, which increases the growth capability for accessing more devices.

Initial program load from an alternative subchannel set

IBM z16 A01 systems support initial program load (IPL) from alternative subchannel sets in addition to subchannel set 0. Devices that are used early during IPL processing now can be accessed by using subchannel set 1, subchannel set 2, or subchannel set3 on an IBM z16.



--- Chunk 5826 ---
 subchannel sets in addition to subchannel set 0. Devices that are used early during IPL processing now can be accessed by using subchannel set 1, subchannel set 2, or subchannel set3 on an IBM z16.

This configuration allows the users of Metro Mirror (formerly PPRC) secondary devices that are defined by using the same device number and a new device type in an alternative subchannel set to be used for IPL, an I/O definition file (IODF), and stand-alone memory dump volumes, when needed.

5.1.3  Channel path spanning

With the implementation of multiple LCSSs, a channel path can be available to LPARs as dedicated, shared, and spanned.

Although a shared channel path can be shared by LPARs within a same LCSS, a spanned channel path can be shared by LPARs within and across LCSSs.



--- Chunk 5827 ---
vailable to LPARs as dedicated, shared, and spanned.

Although a shared channel path can be shared by LPARs within a same LCSS, a spanned channel path can be shared by LPARs within and across LCSSs.

By assigning the same CHPID from different LCSSs to the same channel path (for example, a PCHID), the channel path can be accessed by any LPARs from these LCSSs at the same time. The CHPID is spanned across those LCSSs. The use of spanned channels paths decreases the number of channels that are needed in an installation of IBM Z servers.

A sample of channel paths that are defined as dedicated, shared, and spanned is shown in Figure 5-3.

A sample of channel paths that are defined as dedicated, shared, and spanned is shown in Figure 5-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

The following definitions of a channel path are shown in Figure 5-3:

- /SM590000 CHPID FF, assigned to PCHID 20A, is dedicated access for partition 15 of LCSS0. The same applies to CHPID 00,01,02 of LCSS0, and CHPID 00,01,FF of LCSS1.
- /SM590000 CHPID 03, assigned to PCHID 20E, is shared access for partition 2, and 15 of LCSS0. The same applies to CHPID 05 of LCSS1.
- /SM590000 CHPID 06, assigned to PCHID 120 is spanned access for partition 1, 15 of LCSS0, and partition 16, 17 of LCSS1. The same applies to CHPID 04.

Channel spanning is supported for internal links (HiperSockets and IC links) and for specific types of external links. External links that are supported on IBM z16 A01 systems include FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, FICON Express16S+, OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, OSA-Express6S, and Coupling Links.

The definition of LPAR name, MIF image ID, and LPAR ID are used to identify an LPAR by the channel subsystem to identify I/O functions from different LPARs of multiple LCSSs, which support the implementation of these dedicated, shared, and spanned paths.

An example of definition of these LPAR-related identifications is shown in Figure 5-4.

<!-- missing-text -->

LPAR name

The LPAR name is defined as partition name parameter in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. The LPAR name must be unique across the server.

MIF image ID

The MIF image ID is defined as a parameter for each LPAR in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. It ranges 1 - F, and must be unique within an LCSS. However, duplicates are allowed in different LCSSs.



--- Chunk 5830 ---
 ID is defined as a parameter for each LPAR in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. It ranges 1 - F, and must be unique within an LCSS. However, duplicates are allowed in different LCSSs.

If a MIF image ID is not defined, an arbitrary ID is assigned when the I/O configuration activated. The IBM z16 server supports a maximum of six LCSSs, with a total of 85 LPARs that can be defined.

Each LCSS of an IBM z16 A01 system can support the following numbers of LPARs:

- /SM590000 LCSS0 to LCSS4 support 15 LPARs each, and the MIF image ID is 1 - F.
- /SM590000 LCSS5 supports 10 LPARs, and the MIF image IDs are 1 - A.

LPAR ID

The LPAR ID is defined by a user in an image activation profile for each LPAR. It is a 2-digit hexadecimal number 00 - 7F. The LPAR ID must be unique across the server.



--- Chunk 5831 ---
mage IDs are 1 - A.

LPAR ID

The LPAR ID is defined by a user in an image activation profile for each LPAR. It is a 2-digit hexadecimal number 00 - 7F. The LPAR ID must be unique across the server.

Although it is arbitrarily defined by the user, an LPAR ID often is the CSS ID concatenated to its MIF image ID, which makes the value more meaningful for the system administrator. For example, an LPAR with LPAR ID 1A defined in that manner means that the LPAR is defined in LCSS1, with the MIF image ID A.

The following tools are available to help maintain and optimize the I/O configuration:

- /SM590000 IBM Configurator for e-business (eConfig)
- The eConfig tool is used by your IBM representative. It is used to create configurations or upgrades of a configuration, and maintains tracking to the installed features of those configurations. eConfig produces reports that help you understand the changes that are being made for a new system, or a system upgrade, and what the target configuration looks like.

--- Chunk 5833 ---
orts that help you understand the changes that are being made for a new system, or a system upgrade, and what the target configuration looks like.

HCD supplies an interactive dialog to generate the IODF, and later the IOCDS. Generally, use HCD or Hardware Configuration Manager (HCM) to generate the I/O configuration rather than writing I/O configuration program (IOCP) statements. The validation checking that HCD runs against a IODF source file helps minimize the risk of errors before an I/O configuration is activated.

HCD support for multiple channel subsystems is available with z/VM and z/OS. HCD provides the capability to make dynamic hardware and software I/O configuration changes.

6.1  Cryptography enhancements on IBM z16

IBM recognizes that with any new technology, new threats exist, and as such, suitable counter measures must be taken. Quantum technology can be used for incredible good, but in the hands of an adversary, it has the potential to weaken or break core cryptographic primitives that were used to secure systems and communications. Quantum-safe cryptography aims to provide protection against attacks that can be started by quantum computers.

The IBM z16 uses quantum-safe technologies to help protect your business-critical infrastructure and data from potential attacks.

The IBM z16 uses quantum-safe technologies to help protect your business-critical infrastructure and data from potential attacks.

The IBM z16 delivers a transparent and consumable approach that enables extensive (pervasive) encryption of data in flight and at rest, with the goal of substantially simplifying data security and reducing the costs that are associated with protecting data while achieving compliance mandates.

Naming: The IBM z16, Machine Type 3931 (M/T 3931), Model A01 is further identified as IBM z16 , unless otherwise specified.

IBM z16 introduced the new PCI Crypto Express8S feature (that can be managed by a new Trusted Key Entry (TKE) workstation) together with a further improved CPACF Coprocessor.

IBM z16 includes standard cryptographic hardware and optional cryptographic features for flexibility and growth capability. IBM has a long history of providing hardware cryptographic solutions. This history stretches from the development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in the 1970s to the Crypto Express tamper-sensing and tamper-responding programmable features.

Crypto Express meets the US Government's highest security rating of FIPS 140-3 Level 4 certification 1 . It also meets several other security ratings, such as the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, the PCI HSM criteria, and the criteria for German Banking Industry Commission (formerly known as Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft evaluation).

6.2  Cryptography overview

Throughout history, a need existed for secret communication between people that cannot be understood by outside parties.

Also, it is necessary to ensure that a message cannot be corrupted (message integrity), while ensuring that the sender and the receiver really are the persons who they claim to be. Over time, several methods were used to achieve these objectives, with more or less success. Many procedures and algorithms for encrypting and decrypting data were developed that are increasingly complicated and time-consuming.

6.2.1  Modern cryptography

With the development of computing technology, the encryption and decryption algorithms can be performed by computers, which enables the use of complicated mathematical algorithms. Most of these algorithms are based on the prime factorization of large numbers.

Cryptography is used to meet the following requirements:

- /SM590000 Data protection



--- Chunk 5875 ---
icated mathematical algorithms. Most of these algorithms are based on the prime factorization of large numbers.

Cryptography is used to meet the following requirements:

- /SM590000 Data protection

The protection of data usually is the main concept that is associated with cryptography. Only authorized persons should be able to read the message or get information about it. Data is encrypted by using a known algorithm and secret keys, such that the intended party can de-scramble the data, but an interloper cannot. This concept is also referred to as confidentiality .

- /SM590000 Authentication (identity validation)

This process decides whether the communication partners are who they claim to be, which can be done by using certificates and signatures. It must be possible to clearly identify the owner of the data or the sender and the receiver of the message.

- /SM590000 Message (data) Integrity



--- Chunk 5876 ---
h can be done by using certificates and signatures. It must be possible to clearly identify the owner of the data or the sender and the receiver of the message.

- /SM590000 Message (data) Integrity

The verification of data ensures that what was received is identical to what was sent. It must be proven that the data is complete and was not altered during the moment it was transmitted (by the sender) and the moment it was received (by the receiver).

- /SM590000 Nonrepudiation

It must be impossible for the owner of the data or the sender of the message to deny authorship. Nonrepudiation ensures that both sides of a communication know that the other side agreed to what was exchanged, and not someone else. This specification implies a legal liability and contractual obligation, which is the same as a signature on a contract.

These goals should all be possible without unacceptable overhead to the communication. The goal is to keep the system secure, manageable, and productive.



--- Chunk 5877 ---
h is the same as a signature on a contract.

These goals should all be possible without unacceptable overhead to the communication. The goal is to keep the system secure, manageable, and productive.

The basic data protection method is achieved by encrypting and decrypting the data, while hash algorithms, message authentication codes (MACs), digital signatures, and certificates are used for authentication, data integrity, and nonrepudiation.

6.2.3  Keys

When encrypting a message, the sender transforms the clear text into a secret text. Doing so requires the following main elements:



--- Chunk 5878 ---
r authentication, data integrity, and nonrepudiation.

6.2.3  Keys

When encrypting a message, the sender transforms the clear text into a secret text. Doing so requires the following main elements:

- /SM590000 The algorithm is the mathematical or logical formula that is applied to the key and the clear text to deliver a ciphered result, or to take a ciphered text and deliver the original clear text.
- /SM590000 The key ensures that the result of the encrypting data transformation by the algorithm is only the same when the same key is used. That decryption of a ciphered message results only in the original clear message when the correct key is used. Therefore, the receiver of a ciphered message must know which algorithm and key must be used to decrypt the message.

6.2.2  Kerckhoffs' principle



--- Chunk 5879 ---
riginal clear message when the correct key is used. Therefore, the receiver of a ciphered message must know which algorithm and key must be used to decrypt the message.

6.2.2  Kerckhoffs' principle

In modern cryptography, the algorithm is published and known to everyone, whereas the keys are kept secret. This configuration corresponds to Kerckhoffs' principle, which is named after Auguste Kerckhoffs, a Dutch cryptographer, who formulated it in 1883:

'A system should not depend on secrecy, and it should be able to fall into the enemy's hands without disadvantage.'

In other words, the security of a cryptographic system should depend on the security of the key, so the key must be kept secret. Therefore, the secure management of keys is the primal task of modern cryptographic systems.

Adhering to Kerckhoffs' Principle is done for the following reasons:



--- Chunk 5880 ---
ey, so the key must be kept secret. Therefore, the secure management of keys is the primal task of modern cryptographic systems.

Adhering to Kerckhoffs' Principle is done for the following reasons:

- /SM590000 It is much more difficult to keep an algorithm secret than a key.
- /SM590000 It is harder to exchange a compromised algorithm than to exchange a compromised key.
- /SM590000 Secret algorithms can be reconstructed by reverse engineering software or hardware implementations.
- /SM590000 Errors in public algorithms can generally be found more easily, when many experts examine it.
- /SM590000 In history, most secret encryption methods proved to be weak and inadequate.
- /SM590000 When a secret encryption method is used, it is possible that a back door was built in.
- /SM590000 If an algorithm is public, many experts can form an opinion about it. Also, the method can be more thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

oor was built in.
- /SM590000 If an algorithm is public, many experts can form an opinion about it. Also, the method can be more thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

The keys that are used for the cryptographic algorithms often are sequences of numbers and characters, but can also be any other sequence of bits. The length of a key influences the security (strength) of the cryptographic method. The longer the used key, the more difficult it is to compromise a cryptographic algorithm.

For example, the DES (symmetric key) algorithm uses keys with a length of 56 bits, Triple-DES (TDES) uses keys with a length of 112 bits, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The asymmetric key RSA algorithm (named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) uses keys with a length of 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits.

- /SM590000 A clear key is a key that is transferred from the application in clear text to the cryptographic function. The key value is stored in the clear (at least briefly) somewhere in unprotected memory areas. Therefore, the key can be made available to someone under specific circumstances who is accessing this memory area.
- This risk must be considered when clear keys are used. However, many applications exist where this risk can be accepted. For example, the transaction security for the (widely used) encryption methods Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is based on clear keys.
- /SM590000 The value of a protected key is stored only in clear in memory areas that cannot be read by applications or users. The key value does not exist outside of the physical hardware, although the hardware might not be tamper-resistant. The principle of protected keys is unique to IBM Z. For more information, see 6.4.2, 'CPACF protected key' on page 222.

 of the physical hardware, although the hardware might not be tamper-resistant. The principle of protected keys is unique to IBM Z. For more information, see 6.4.2, 'CPACF protected key' on page 222.
- /SM590000 For a secure key , the key value does not exist in clear format outside of a special hardware device (HSM), which must be secured and tamper-resistant. A secure key is protected from disclosure and misuse, and can be used for the trusted execution of cryptographic algorithms on highly sensitive data. If used and stored outside of the HSM, a secure key must be encrypted with a master key , which is created within the HSM and never leaves the HSM.

Because a secure key must be handled in a special hardware device, the use of secure keys usually is far slower than the use of clear keys, as shown in Figure 6-1.

6.2.4  Algorithms

The following algorithms of modern cryptography are differentiated based on whether they use the same key for the encryption of the message as for the decryption:

- /SM590000 Symmetric algorithms use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. The function that is used to decrypt the data is the opposite of the function that is used to encrypt the data. Because the same key is used on both sides of an operation, it must be negotiated between both parties and kept secret. Therefore, symmetric algorithms are also known as secret key algorithms .
- The main advantage of symmetric algorithms is that they are fast and therefore can be used for large amounts of data, even if they are not run on specialized hardware. The disadvantage is that the key must be known by both sender and receiver of the messages, which implies that the key must be exchanged between them. This key exchange is a weak point that can be attacked.



--- Chunk 6086 ---
dvantage is that the key must be known by both sender and receiver of the messages, which implies that the key must be exchanged between them. This key exchange is a weak point that can be attacked.

Prominent examples for symmetric algorithms are DES, TDES, and AES.

- /SM590000 Asymmetric algorithms use two distinct but related keys: the public key and the private key . As the names imply, the private key must be kept secret, whereas the public key is shown to everyone. However, with asymmetric cryptography, it is not important who sees or knows the public key. Whatever is done with one key can be undone by the other key only.

For example, data that is encrypted by the public key can be decrypted by the associated private key only, and vice versa. Unlike symmetric algorithms, which use distinct functions for encryption and decryption, only one function is used in asymmetric algorithms. Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data.



--- Chunk 6087 ---
 use distinct functions for encryption and decryption, only one function is used in asymmetric algorithms. Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data.

Asymmetric algorithms are also known as public key algorithms .

Asymmetric algorithms use complex calculations and are relatively slow (about 100 - 1000 times slower than symmetric algorithms). Therefore, such algorithms are not used for the encryption of bulk data.

Because the private key is never exchanged between the parties in communication, they are less vulnerable than symmetric algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms mainly are used for authentication, digital signatures, and for the encryption and exchange of secret keys, which in turn are used to encrypt bulk data with a symmetric algorithm.

Examples for asymmetric algorithms are RSA and the elliptic curve algorithms.



--- Chunk 6088 ---
for the encryption and exchange of secret keys, which in turn are used to encrypt bulk data with a symmetric algorithm.

Examples for asymmetric algorithms are RSA and the elliptic curve algorithms.

- /SM590000 One-way algorithms are not cryptographic functions. They do not use keys, and they can scramble data only, not de-scramble it. These algorithms are used extensively within cryptographic procedures for digital signing and tend to be developed and governed by using the same principles as cryptographic algorithms. One-way algorithms are also known as hash algorithms .

The most prominent one-way algorithms are the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA).

6.3  Cryptography on IBM z16

In principle, cryptographic algorithms can run on processor hardware. However, these workloads are compute-intensive, and the handling of secure keys also requires special hardware protection. Therefore, IBM Z offer several cryptographic hardware features, which are specialized to meet the requirements for cryptographic workload.

The cryptographic hardware that is supported on IBM z16 is shown in Figure 6-2. These features are described in this chapter.

Finally, a TKE workstation is required for entering keys in a secure way into the Crypto Express8S HSM, which often also is equipped with smart card readers. For more information, see 6.6, 'Trusted Key Entry workstation' on page 239.

A TKE includes support for AES encryption algorithm with 256-bit master keys and key management functions to load or generate master keys to the cryptographic coprocessor.

If the TKE workstation is chosen to operate the Crypto Express8S adapter in an IBM z16, TKE workstation with the TKE 10.0 LIC is required. For more information, see 6.6, 'Trusted Key Entry workstation' on page 239.

To access and use the cryptographic hardware devices that are provided by IBM z16, the application must use an application programming interface (API) that is provided by the operating system.

ICSF is a software component of z/OS. ICSF works with the hardware cryptographic features and the Security Server (IBM Resource Access Control Facility [IBM RACF] element) to provide secure, high-speed cryptographic services in the z/OS environment. ICSF provides the APIs by which applications request the cryptographic services, and from the CPACF and the Crypto Express features.

ICSF transparently routes application requests for cryptographic services to one of the integrated cryptographic engines (CPACF or a Crypto Express feature), depending on performance or requested cryptographic function. ICSF is also the means by which the secure Crypto Express features are loaded with master key values, which allows the hardware features to be used by applications.

The cryptographic hardware that is installed in IBM z16 determines the cryptographic features and services that are available to the applications.

The users of the cryptographic services call the ICSF API. Some functions are performed by the ICSF software without starting the cryptographic hardware features. Other functions result in ICSF going into routines that contain proprietary IBM Z crypto instructions. These instructions are run by a CPU engine and result in a work request that is generated for a cryptographic hardware feature.

This cryptographic coprocessor, which is known as the CPACF , is not qualified as an HSM; therefore, it is not suitable for handling algorithms that use secret keys. However, the coprocessor can be used for cryptographic algorithms that use clear keys or protected keys. The CPACF works synchronously with the PU, which means that the owning processor is busy when its coprocessor is busy. This setup provides a fast device for cryptographic services.

CPACF supports pervasive encryption. Simple policy controls allow businesses to enable encryption to protect data in mission-critical databases without the need to stop the database or re-create database objects. Pervasive encryption includes z/OS Dataset Encryption, z/OS Coupling Facility Encryption, z/VM encrypted hypervisor paging, and z/TPF transparent database encryption, which use performance enhancements in the hardware.

The CPACF offers a set of symmetric cryptographic functions that enhances the encryption and decryption performance of clear key operations. These functions are for SSL, virtual private network (VPN), and data-storing applications that do not require FIPS 140-2 Level 4 security.

It ensures that key material is not visible to applications or operating systems during encryption operations. For more information, see 6.4.2, 'CPACF protected key' on page 222.

For the SHA hashing algorithms and the random number generation algorithms, only clear keys are used. For the symmetric encryption and decryption DES and AES algorithms and clear keys, protected keys also can be used. On IBM z16, protected keys require a Crypto Express adapter that is running in CCA mode.

For more information, see 6.5.2, 'Crypto Express8S as a CCA coprocessor' on page 228.

The hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, are enabled on all systems and do not require the CPACF enablement feature. For all other algorithms, the no-charge CPACF enablement feature (FC 3863) is required.

The CPACF functions are implemented as processor instructions and require operating system support for use. Operating systems that use the CPACF instructions include z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on IBM Z.

6.4.2  CPACF protected key

IBM z16 supports the protected key implementation. Secure keys are processed on the PCIeCC adapters (HSMs) 3 . This process requires an asynchronous operation to move the data and keys from the general-purpose central processor (CP) to the crypto adapters.



--- Chunk 6106 ---
keys are processed on the PCIeCC adapters (HSMs) 3 . This process requires an asynchronous operation to move the data and keys from the general-purpose central processor (CP) to the crypto adapters.

Clear keys process faster than secure keys because the process is done synchronously on the CPACF. Protected keys blend the security of Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Crypto Express6S coprocessors and the performance characteristics of the CPACF. This process allows it to run closer to the speed of clear keys.

CPACF facilitates the continued privacy of cryptographic key material when used for data encryption. In Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Express6S coprocessors, a secure key is encrypted under a master key. However, a protected key is encrypted under a wrapping key that is unique to each LPAR.



--- Chunk 6107 ---
n Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Express6S coprocessors, a secure key is encrypted under a master key. However, a protected key is encrypted under a wrapping key that is unique to each LPAR.

Because the wrapping key is unique to each LPAR, a protected key cannot be shared with another LPAR. By using key wrapping, CPACF ensures that key material is not visible to applications or operating systems during encryption operations.

CPACF code generates the wrapping key and stores it in the protected area of the hardware system area (HSA). The wrapping key is accessible only by firmware. It cannot be accessed by operating systems or applications.

DES/T-DES and AES algorithms are implemented in CPACF code with the support of hardware assist functions. Two variations of wrapping keys are generated: one for DES/T-DES keys and another for AES keys.



--- Chunk 6108 ---
/T-DES and AES algorithms are implemented in CPACF code with the support of hardware assist functions. Two variations of wrapping keys are generated: one for DES/T-DES keys and another for AES keys.

Wrapping keys are generated during the clear reset each time an LPAR is activated or reset. No customizable option is available at Support Element (SE) or Hardware Management Console (HMC) that permits or avoids the wrapping key generation. This function flow for the Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, and Crypto Express6S adapters is shown in Figure 6-5.

<!-- missing-text -->

The key wrapping for Crypto Express8S is similar to Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S. The CPACF Wrapping Key and the Transport Key for use with Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S are in a protected area of the HSA that is not visible to operating systems or applications.



--- Chunk 6109 ---
Express6S. The CPACF Wrapping Key and the Transport Key for use with Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S are in a protected area of the HSA that is not visible to operating systems or applications.

If a Crypto ExpressxS coprocessor (CEX8C, CEX7C, or CEX6C) is available, a protected key can begin its life as a secure key. Otherwise, an application is responsible for creating or loading a clear key value and then, uses the PCKMO instruction to wrap the key. ICSF is not called by the application if the CEXxC is not available.

A new segment in the profiles of the CSFKEYS class in IBM RACFfi restricts which secure keys can be used as protected keys. By default, all secure keys are considered not eligible to be used as protected keys. The process that is shown in Figure 6-5 considers a secure key as the source of a protected key.



--- Chunk 6110 ---
protected keys. By default, all secure keys are considered not eligible to be used as protected keys. The process that is shown in Figure 6-5 considers a secure key as the source of a protected key.

The source key in this case is stored in the ICSF Cryptographic Key Data Set (CKDS) as a secure key, which was encrypted under the master key. This secure key is sent to CEX8C, CEX7C, or CEX6C to be deciphered and then, sent to the CPACF in clear text.

At the CPACF, the key is wrapped under the LPAR wrapping key, and is then returned to ICSF. After the key is wrapped, ICSF can keep the protected value in memory. It then passes it to the CPACF, where the key is unwrapped for each encryption or decryption operation.



--- Chunk 6111 ---
 then returned to ICSF. After the key is wrapped, ICSF can keep the protected value in memory. It then passes it to the CPACF, where the key is unwrapped for each encryption or decryption operation.

The protected key is designed to provide substantial throughput improvements for a large volume of data encryption and low latency for encryption of small blocks of data. A high-performance secure key solution, also known as a protected key solution , requires the ICSF HCR7770 as a minimum release.

6.5  Crypto Express8S

The Crypto Express8S feature (FC 0908 or FC 0909) is an optional feature that is exclusive to IBM z16 systems. Each feature FC 0909 has one IBM 4770 PCIe cryptographic adapter (hardware security module [HSM]), whereas FC 0908 has two IBM 4770 PCIe cryptographic adapters (two HSMs). The Crypto Express8S (CEX8S) feature occupies one I/O slot in an IBM z16 PCIe+ I/O drawer. This feature provides one or two HSMs and for a secure programming and hardware environment on which crypto processes are run.

Each cryptographic coprocessor includes a general-purpose processor, nonvolatile storage, and specialized cryptographic electronics. The Crypto Express8S feature provides tamper-sensing and tamper-responding, high-performance cryptographic operations.

Customers who migrated to variable-length AES key tokens cannot take advantage of faster encryption speeds by using CPACF. Support is being added to translate a secure variable-length AES CIPHER token to a protected key token (protected by the system wrapping key). This support allows for faster AES encryption speeds when variable-length tokens are used while maintaining strong levels of security.

Crypto Express7S (1 or 2 ports) and Crypto Express6S features (single HSM) are not orderable for a new build IBM z16 A01 system, but can be carried forward from an IBM z14 or IBM z15 by using an MES.

The concept of dedicated processor does not apply to the PCIe cryptographic adapter. Whether configured as a coprocessor or an accelerator, the PCIe cryptographic adapter is made available to an LPAR. It is made available as directed by the domain assignment and the candidate list in the LPAR image profile. This availability is not changed by the shared or dedicated status that is given to the PUs in the partition.

When installed nonconcurrently, Crypto Express8S features are assigned PCIe cryptographic adapter numbers sequentially during the power-on reset (POR) that follows the installation. When a Crypto Express8S feature is installed concurrently, the installation can select an out-of-sequence number from the unused range. When a Crypto Express8S (Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S) feature is removed concurrently, the PCIe adapter numbers are automatically freed.

The definition of domain indexes and PCIe cryptographic adapter numbers in the candidate list for each LPAR must be planned to allow for nondisruptive changes. Consider the following points:

With this function, adding and removing the cryptographic feature without stopping a running operating system can be done dynamically.
- /SM590000 The same usage domain index can be defined more than once across multiple LPARs. However, the PCIe cryptographic adapter number that is coupled with the usage domain index that is specified must be unique across all active LPARs.

The same PCIe cryptographic adapter number and usage domain index combination can be defined for more than one LPAR (up to 85 for IBM z16). For example, you might define a configuration for backup situations. However, only one of the LPARs can be active at a time.

- /SM590000 DES/TDES with DES/TDES MAC/CMAC
- The Data Encryption Standard is a widespread symmetrical encryption algorithm. DES, along with its double-length and triple length variations, TDES today are considered to be insufficiently secure for many applications. They were replaced by AES as the official US standard, but it is still used in the industry with the MAC and the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) for verifying the integrity of messages.
- /SM590000 AES, AESKW, AES GMAC, AES GCM, AES XTS, AES CIPHER mode, and CMAC
- AES replaced DES as the official US standard in October 2000. The enhanced standards for AES Key Warp (AESKW), AES Galois Message Authentication Code (AES GMAC), and Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM), the XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing (AES XTS), and CMAC are supported.
- /SM590000 MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, or SHA-3 4  (224, 256, 384, and 512), and HMAC

- /SM590000 MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, or SHA-3 4  (224, 256, 384, and 512), and HMAC
- The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1 and the enhanced SHA-2 or SHA-3 for different block sizes), the older message-digest (MD5) algorithm, and the advanced keyed-hash method authentication code (HMAC) are used for verifying the data integrity and the authentication of a message.

User-defined extensions support

User-defined extension (UDX) allows a developer to add customized operations to IBM's CCA Support Program. UDXs to the CCA support customized operations that run within the Crypto Express features when defined as a coprocessor.

UDX is supported under a special contract through an IBM or approved third-party service offering. The Crypto Cards website directs your request to an IBM representative for your geographic location. A special contract is negotiated between IBM and you for the development of the UDX code by IBM according to your specifications and an agreed-upon level of the UDX.

A UDX toolkit for IBM Z is tied to specific versions of the CCA code and the related host code. UDX is available for the Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, and Crypto Express6S (Secure IBM CCA coprocessor mode only) features. An UDX migration is no more disruptive than a normal Microcode Change Level (MCL) or ICSF release migration.

In IBM z16, up to four UDX files can be imported. These files can be imported from a USB media stick or an FTP server. The UDX configuration window is updated to include a Reset to IBM Default button.

Greater than 16 domains support

IBM z16 A01 supports up to 85 LPARs. The IBM Z crypto architecture supports 16 domains, which matched the LPAR maximum at the time. Before z13 systems, crypto workload separation can be complex in customer environments where the number of LPARs was larger than 16. These customers mapped a large set of LPARs to a small set of crypto domains.

Starting with IBM z14, the IBM Z crypto architecture can support up to 256 domains in an adjunct processor (AP) with the AP extended addressing (APXA) facility that is installed. As such, the Crypto Express adapters are enhanced to handle 256 domains.

The IBM Z firmware provides up to 85 domains for IBM z16 to customers (to match the current LPAR maximum). Customers can map individual LPARs to unique crypto domains or continue to share crypto domains across LPARs.

Payment Card Industry-HSM certification

PCI standards are developed to help ensure security in the PCI. PCI defines their standards as a set of security standards that is designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information is maintained a secure environment.



--- Chunk 6645 ---
ines their standards as a set of security standards that is designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information is maintained a secure environment.

Compliance with the PCI-HSM standard is valuable for customers, particularly those customers who are in the banking and finance industry. This certification is important to clients for the following fundamental reasons:

- /SM590000 Compliance is increasingly becoming mandatory
- /SM590000 The requirements in PCI-HSM make the system more secure.

Industry requirements for PCI-HSM compliance

The PCI organization cannot require compliance with its standards. Compliance with PCI standards is enforced by the payment card brands, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB International, and Discover.



--- Chunk 6646 ---
ation cannot require compliance with its standards. Compliance with PCI standards is enforced by the payment card brands, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB International, and Discover.

If you are a bank, acquirer, processor, or other participant in the payment card systems, the card brands can impose requirements on you if you want to process their cards. One set of requirements they are increasingly enforcing is the PCI standards.

The card brands work with PCI in developing these standards, and they focused first on the standards they considered most important, particularly the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Some of the other standards were written or required later, and PCI-HSM is one of the last standards to be developed. In addition, the standards themselves were increasing the strength of their requirements over time. Some requirements that were optional in earlier versions of the standards are now mandatory.



--- Chunk 6647 ---
oped. In addition, the standards themselves were increasing the strength of their requirements over time. Some requirements that were optional in earlier versions of the standards are now mandatory.

In general, the trend is for the card brands to enforce more of the PCI standards and to enforce them more rigorously. The trend in the standards is to impose more and stricter requirements in each successive version. The net result is that companies subject to these requirements can expect that they eventually must comply with all of the requirements.

Improved security through use of PCI-HSM

PCI-HSM was developed primarily to improve security in payment card systems. It imposes requirements in key management, HSM API functions, and device physical security. It also controls during manufacturing and delivery, device administration, and several other areas. It prohibits many things that were in common use for many years, but are no longer considered secure.



--- Chunk 6648 ---
also controls during manufacturing and delivery, device administration, and several other areas. It prohibits many things that were in common use for many years, but are no longer considered secure.

The result of these requirements is that applications and procedures often must be updated because they used some of the things that are now prohibited. Although this issue is inconvenient and imposes some costs, it does increase the resistance of the systems to attacks of various kinds. Updating a system to use PCI-HSM compliant HSMs is expected to reduce the risk of loss for the institution and its clients.

g Encryption

VFPE refers to a method of encryption in which the resulting cipher text features the same form as the input clear text. The form of the text can vary according to use and application.

One of the classic examples is a 16-digit credit card number. After VFPE is used to encrypt a credit card number, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications.

umber, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications.

VFPE allows customers to add encryption to their applications in such a way that the encrypted data can flow through their systems without requiring a massive redesign of their application. In our example, if the credit card number is VFPE-encrypted at the point of entry, the cipher text still behaves as a credit card number. It can flow through business logic until it meets a back-end transaction server that can VFPE-decrypt it to get the original credit card number to process the transaction.

Note: VFPE technology forms part of Visa, Inc.'s, Data Secure Platform (DSP). The use of this function requires a service agreement with Visa. You must maintain a valid service agreement with Visa when you use DSP/FPE.

AES PIN support for the German banking industry

The German banking industry organization, DK, defined a new set of PIN processing functions to be used on the internal systems of banks and their servers. CCA is designed to support the functions that are essential to those parts of the German banking industry that are governed by DK requirements. The functions include key management support for new AES key types, AES key derivation support, and several DK-specific PIN and administrative functions.

This support includes PIN method APIs, PIN administration APIs, new key management verbs, and new access control points support that is needed for DK-defined functions.

PKA Translate UDX function into CCA

UDX is custom code that allows the client to add unique operations or extensions to the CCA firmware. Specific UDX functions are integrated into the base CCA code over time to accomplish the following tasks:

- /SM590000 Remove headaches and challenges that are associated with UDX management and currency.
- /SM590000 Make available popular UDX functions to a wider audience to encourage adoption.

UDX is integrated into the base CCA code to support translating an external RSA CRT key into new formats. These formats use tags to identify key components. Depending on which new rule array keyword is used with the PKA Key Translate callable service, the service TDES encrypts those components in CBC or ECB mode. In addition, AES CMAC support is delivered.

6.5.4  Crypto Express8S as an accelerator

A Crypto Express8S adapter that is running in accelerator mode supports only RSA clear key and SSL Acceleration. A request is processed fully in hardware.

The Crypto Express accelerator is a coprocessor that is reconfigured by the installation process so that it uses only a subset of the coprocessor functions at a higher speed. Reconfiguration is disruptive to coprocessor and accelerator operations. The coprocessor or accelerator must be deactivated before you begin the reconfiguration.



--- Chunk 6859 ---
ocessor functions at a higher speed. Reconfiguration is disruptive to coprocessor and accelerator operations. The coprocessor or accelerator must be deactivated before you begin the reconfiguration.

FIPS 140-2 certification is not relevant to the accelerator because it operates with clear keys only. The function extension capability through UDX is not available to the accelerator.

The functions that remain available when the Crypto Express8S feature is configured as an accelerator are used for the acceleration of modular arithmetic operations. That is, the RSA cryptographic operations are used with the SSL/TLS protocol. The following operations are accelerated:

- /SM590000 PKA Decrypt (CSNDPKD) with PKCS-1.2 formatting
- /SM590000 PKA Encrypt (CSNDPKE) with zero-pad formatting
- /SM590000 Digital Signature Verify

The RSA encryption and decryption functions support key lengths of 512 - 4,096 bits in the Modulus-Exponent (ME) and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) formats.

6.5.5  Managing Crypto Express8S

Each cryptographic coprocessor has 85 physical sets of registers or queue registers, which corresponds to the maximum number of LPARs that are running on an IBM z16 A01, which is also 85. Each of these sets belongs to the following domains:



--- Chunk 6861 ---
ical sets of registers or queue registers, which corresponds to the maximum number of LPARs that are running on an IBM z16 A01, which is also 85. Each of these sets belongs to the following domains:

- /SM590000 A cryptographic domain index, in the range of 0 - 84 for IBM z16 A01, is allocated to a logical partition in its image profile. The same domain also must be allocated to the ICSF instance that is running in the logical partition that uses the Options data set.
- /SM590000 Each ICSF instance accesses only the Master Keys or queue registers that correspond to the domain number that is specified in the logical partition image profile at the SE and in its Options data set. Each ICSF instance sees a logical cryptographic coprocessor that consists of the physical cryptographic engine and the unique set of registers (the domain) that is allocated to this logical partition.



--- Chunk 6862 ---
ch ICSF instance sees a logical cryptographic coprocessor that consists of the physical cryptographic engine and the unique set of registers (the domain) that is allocated to this logical partition.

The installation of CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) DES/TDES enablement (FC 3863) is required to use the Crypto Express7S feature.

Each Crypto Express8S FC 0908 includes two IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessors (PCIeCC), which is a hardware security module (HSM); FC 0909 includes one IBM 4770 PCIeCC. The adapters are available in the following configurations:

- /SM590000 IBM Enterprise Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) Coprocessor (CEX8C)
- /SM590000 IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards #11 (PKCS) Coprocessor (CEX8P)
- /SM590000 IBM Crypto Express7S Accelerator (CEX8A)

During the feature installation, the PCI-X adapter is configured by default as the CCA coprocessor.



--- Chunk 6863 ---
phy Standards #11 (PKCS) Coprocessor (CEX8P)
- /SM590000 IBM Crypto Express7S Accelerator (CEX8A)

During the feature installation, the PCI-X adapter is configured by default as the CCA coprocessor.

The configuration of the Crypto Express8S adapter as EP11 coprocessor requires a TKE workstation (FC 0057/0058) with TKE 10.0 (FC 0882) LIC. The same requirement applies to CCA mode for a full PCI-compliant environment.

The Crypto Express8S feature does not use CHPIDs from the channel subsystem pool. However, the Crypto Express8S feature requires one slot in a PCIe I/O drawer, and one PCHID for each PCIe cryptographic adapter.

For enabling an LPAR to use a Crypto Express8S adapter, the following cryptographic resources in the image profile must be defined for each partition:

- /SM590000 Usage domain index
- /SM590000 Control domain index
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Candidate List
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Online List



--- Chunk 6864 ---
ed for each partition:

- /SM590000 Usage domain index
- /SM590000 Control domain index
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Candidate List
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Online List

This task is accomplished by using the Customize/Delete Activation Profile task, which is in the Operational Customization Group, from the HMC or from the SE. Modify the cryptographic initial definition from the Crypto option in the image profile, as shown in Figure 6-6.

Important: After this definition is modified, any change to the image profile requires a DEACTIVATE and ACTIVATE of the logical partition for the change to take effect. Therefore, this cryptographic definition is disruptive to a running system.

<!-- missing-text -->

The following cryptographic resource definitions are used:

- /SM590000 Control Domain

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor domains that can be administered from this logical partition if it is set up as the TCP/IP host for the TKE.



--- Chunk 6865 ---
finitions are used:

- /SM590000 Control Domain

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor domains that can be administered from this logical partition if it is set up as the TCP/IP host for the TKE.

If you are setting up the host TCP/IP in this logical partition to communicate with the TKE, the partition is used as a path to other domains' Master Keys. Indicate all the control domains that you want to access (including this partition's own control domain) from this partition.

- /SM590000 Control and Usage Domain

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor domains that are assigned to the partition for all cryptographic coprocessors that are configured on the partition. The usage domains cannot be removed if they are online. The numbers that are selected must match the domain numbers that are entered in the Options data set when you start this partition instance of ICSF.



--- Chunk 6866 ---
age domains cannot be removed if they are online. The numbers that are selected must match the domain numbers that are entered in the Options data set when you start this partition instance of ICSF.

The same usage domain index can be used by multiple partitions, regardless to which CSS they are defined. However, the combination of PCIe adapter number and usage domain index number must be unique across all active partitions.

- /SM590000 Cryptographic Candidate list

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor numbers that can be accessed by this logical partition. From the list, select the coprocessor numbers (in the range 0 - 15) that identify the PCIe adapters to be accessed by this partition.

- /SM590000 Cryptographic Online list

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor numbers that are automatically brought online during logical partition activation. The numbers that are selected in the online list must also be part of the candidate list.



--- Chunk 6867 ---
cryptographic coprocessor numbers that are automatically brought online during logical partition activation. The numbers that are selected in the online list must also be part of the candidate list.

After they are activated, the active partition cryptographic definitions can be viewed from the HMC. Select the CPC, and click View LPAR Cryptographic Controls in the CPC Operational Customization window. The resulting window displays the definition of Usage and Control domain indexes, and PCI Cryptographic candidate and online lists, as shown in Figure 6-7. (Information is provided for active logical partitions only.)

Operational changes can be made by using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task, which reflects the cryptographic definitions in the image profile for the partition. With this function, the cryptographic feature can be added and removed dynamically, without stopping a running operating system.

flat panel display, PCIe adapter, and a writable USB media to install the TKE Licensed Internal Code (LIC) are included with the system unit. The TKE workstation requires an IBM 4770 crypto adapter.

A TKE workstation is part of a customized solution for the use of the Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility for z/OS (ICSF for z/OS) or Linux for IBM Z. This program provides a basic key management system for the cryptographic keys of an IBM z16 system that has Crypto Express features installed.

The TKE provides a secure, remote, and flexible method of providing Master Key Part Entry, and to remotely manage PCIe cryptographic coprocessors. The cryptographic functions on the TKE run by one PCIe cryptographic coprocessor. The TKE workstation communicates with the IBM Z system through a TCP/IP connection. The TKE workstation is available with Ethernet LAN connectivity only. Up to 10 TKE workstations can be ordered.

Tip: For more information about handling a TKE, see the TKE Introduction video.

6.6.1  Logical partition, TKE host, and TKE target

If one or more LPARs are configured to use Crypto Express coprocessors, the TKE workstation can be used to manage DES, AES, ECC, and PKA master keys. This management can be done for all cryptographic domains of each Crypto Express coprocessor feature that is assigned to the LPARs that are defined to the TKE workstation.

Each LPAR in the same system that uses a domain that is managed through a TKE workstation connection is a TKE host or TKE target. An LPAR with a TCP/IP connection to the TKE is referred to as the TKE host ; all other partitions are TKE targets .



--- Chunk 6873 ---
 that is managed through a TKE workstation connection is a TKE host or TKE target. An LPAR with a TCP/IP connection to the TKE is referred to as the TKE host ; all other partitions are TKE targets .

The cryptographic controls that are set for an LPAR through the SE determine whether the workstation is a TKE host or a TKE target.

6.6.2  Optional smart card reader

An optional smart card reader (FC 0891) can be added to the TKE workstation. One FC 0891 includes two smart card readers, two cables to connect them to the TKE workstation, and 20 smart cards. The reader supports the use of smart cards that contain an embedded microprocessor and associated memory for data storage. The memory can contain the keys to be loaded into the Crypto Express features. These readers can be used only with smart cards that have applets that were loaded from a TKE 8.1 or later. These cards are FIPS certified.

in the keys to be loaded into the Crypto Express features. These readers can be used only with smart cards that have applets that were loaded from a TKE 8.1 or later. These cards are FIPS certified.

Smart card readers from FC 0885 or FC 0891 also can be carried forward. Smart cards can be used on TKE 10.0 with these readers. Access to and use of confidential data on the smart card are protected by a user-defined PIN. Up to 990 other smart cards can be ordered for backup (the extra smart card feature code is FC 0900). When one feature code is ordered, 10 smart cards are included. The order increment is 1 - 99 (10 - 990 blank smart cards).



--- Chunk 6875 ---
s can be ordered for backup (the extra smart card feature code is FC 0900). When one feature code is ordered, 10 smart cards are included. The order increment is 1 - 99 (10 - 990 blank smart cards).

If smart cards with applets that are not supported by the new smart card reader are reused, new smart cards on TKE 8.1 or later must be created and the content from the old smart cards to the new smart cards must be copied. The new smart cards can be created and copied on a TKE 8.1 system. If the copies are done on TKE 9.0, the source smart card must be placed in an older smart card reader from feature code 0885 or 0891.

A new smart card for the Trusted Key Entry (TKE) allows stronger Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) levels. More TKE Smart Cards (FC 0900, packs of 10, FIPS certified blanks) require TKE 9.1 LIC or up.

6.6.3  TKE hardware support and migration information

The new TKE 10.0 LIC (FC 0882) is originally shipped with a new IBM z16 server. The following TKE workstations can be ordered with a new IBM z16:

- /SM590000 TKE 10.0 tower workstation (FC 0058)
- /SM590000 TKE 10.0 rack-mounted workstation (FC 0057)

Note: Several options for ordering the TKE with or without ordering Keyboard, Mouse, and Display are available. Ask your IBM Representative for more information about which option is the best option for you.

The TKE 10.0 LIC requires the 4770 crypto adapter. The TKE 9.x and TKE 8.x workstations can be upgraded to the TKE 10.0 tower workstation by purchasing a 4770 crypto adapter.

The TKE 10.0 LIC requires the 4770 crypto adapter. The TKE 9.x and TKE 8.x workstations can be upgraded to the TKE 10.0 tower workstation by purchasing a 4770 crypto adapter.

The Omnikey Cardman 3821 smart card readers can be carried forward to any TKE 10.0 workstation. Smart cards 45D3398, 74Y0551, and 00JA710 can be used on TKE 10.0.

When performing a MES upgrade from TKE 8.x, or TKE 9.x to a TKE 10.0 installation, the following steps must be completed:

- 1. Save Upgrade Data on an old TKE to USB memory to save client data.
- 2. Replace the 4767 crypto adapter with the 4768 crypto adapter.
- 3. Upgrade the firmware to TKE 10.0.
- 4. Install the Frame Roll to apply Save Upgrade Data (client data) to the TKE 10.0 system.
- 5. Run the TKE Workstation Setup wizard.

TKE upgrade considerations

The TKE LIC does not need to be upgraded if you are migrating your configuration with Crypto Express6S and TKE Release 9.x to an IBM z16.

TKE upgrade considerations

The TKE LIC does not need to be upgraded if you are migrating your configuration with Crypto Express6S and TKE Release 9.x to an IBM z16.

Note: If your IBM z16 includes Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S, you can use TKE V9.2, which requires the 4768 cryptographic adapter.

For more information about TKE hardware support, see Table 6-3. For some functions, requirements must be considered; for example, the characterization of a Crypto Express adapter in EP 11 mode always requires the use of a TKE.

<!-- missing-text -->

- a. The TKE workstation can be upgraded to TKE LIC V10.0 by adding a 4770 cryptographic adapter.

Attention: The TKE is unaware of the CPC type where the host crypto module is installed. That is, the TKE does not consider whether a Crypto Express is running on IBM z16, IBM 15, or IBM z14 system. Therefore, the LIC can support any CPC where the coprocessor is supported, but the TKE LIC must support the specific crypto module.

7.2  Support by operating system

IBM z16 systems introduced several new functions. This section describes the support of those functions by the current operating systems. Also included are some of the functions that were introduced in previous IBM Z servers and carried forward or enhanced in IBM z16 servers.

Features and functions that are available on previous servers, but no longer supported by IBM z16 servers, are not documented here.

For more information about supported functions that are based on operating systems, see 7.3, 'IBM z16 features and function support overview' on page 252. Tables are built by function and feature classification to help you determine, by a quick scan, what is supported and the minimum operating system level that is required.

z/OS Version 2 Release 3 is the earliest in-service release that supports IBM z16 servers. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Service support for z/OS Version 2 Release 2 ended in September of 2020; however, a fee-based extension for defect support (for up to three years) can be obtained by ordering IBM Software Support Services - Service Extension for z/OS V2.R2.
- /SM590000 IBM z16 capabilities differ depending on the z/OS release. Toleration support is provided on z/OS V2R2. Exploitation support is provided on z/OS V2R3 and later only 1 .

IBM z16 Model A01 - Up to 85 LPARs

The IBM z16 A01 can be configured with up to 85 LPARs (same as previous models). Because channel subsystems can be shared by up to 15 LPARs, it is necessary to configure six channel subsystems to reach the 85 LPAR limit.

Remember: A virtual appliance that is deployed in a Secure Service Container runs in a dedicated LPAR. When activated, it reduces the maximum number of available LPARs by one.

Remember: A virtual appliance that is deployed in a Secure Service Container runs in a dedicated LPAR. When activated, it reduces the maximum number of available LPARs by one.

Dynamic PU add

Planning an LPAR configuration includes defining reserved PUs that can be brought online when extra capacity is needed. Operating system support is required to use this capability without an IPL; that is, nondisruptively. This support is available in z/OS for some time.

The dynamic PU add function enhances this support by allowing you to dynamically define and change the number and type of reserved PUs in an LPAR profile, which removes any planning requirements. The new resources are immediately made available to the operating system and in the case of z/VM, to its guests.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

Dynamic LPAR memory upgrade

An LPAR can be defined with an initial and a reserved amount of memory. At activation time, the initial amount is made available to the partition and the reserved amount can be added later, partially or totally. Although these two memory zones do not have to be contiguous in real memory, they appear as logically contiguous to the operating system that runs in the LPAR.

z/OS can take advantage of this support and nondisruptively acquire and release memory from the reserved area. z/VM V7R1 and later can acquire memory nondisruptively and immediately make it available to guests.

e advantage of this support and nondisruptively acquire and release memory from the reserved area. z/VM V7R1 and later can acquire memory nondisruptively and immediately make it available to guests.

z/VM virtualizes this support to its guests, which now also can increase their memory nondisruptively if supported by the guest operating system. Currently, releasing memory from z/VM is supported on z/VM V7.2 with PTFs 3 . Releasing memory from the z/VM guest depends on the guest's operating system support.

Linux on IBM Z also supports acquiring and releasing memory nondisruptively. This feature is enabled for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and RHEL 7.9and later releases.

LPAR group absolute capping



--- Chunk 7240 ---

Linux on IBM Z also supports acquiring and releasing memory nondisruptively. This feature is enabled for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and RHEL 7.9and later releases.

LPAR group absolute capping

Group absolute capping allows you to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU that is defined as a CP or an IFL is shared across a set of LPARs. This facility is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus a relative) limit. It is not affected by changes to the logical or physical configuration of the system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs.

Capacity Provisioning Manager

The provisioning architecture enables clients to better control the configuration and activation of the On/Off CoD. For more information, see Chapter 8, 'System upgrades' on page 327. This process is inherently more flexible and can be automated. This capability can result in easier, faster, and more reliable management of the processing capacity.

The Capacity Provisioning Manager, which is a feature that was first available with z/OS V1R9, interfaces with z/OS Workload Manager (WLM) and implements capacity provisioning policies. Several implementation options are available, from an analysis mode that issues only guidelines, to an autonomic mode that provides fully automated operations.

Replacing manual monitoring with autonomic management or supporting manual operation with guidelines can help ensure that sufficient processing power is available with the least possible delay. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253.

Program-directed re-IPL

Program directed re-IPL allows an operating system to re-IPL without operator intervention. This function is supported for SCSI and IBM extended count key data (IBM ECKD) devices.

IOCP

All IBM Z servers require a description of their I/O configuration. This description is stored in I/O configuration data set (IOCDS) files. The I/O configuration program (IOCP) allows for the creation of the IOCDS file from a source file that is known as the I/O configuration source (IOCS).

The IOCS file contains definitions of LPARs and channel subsystems. It also includes detailed information for each channel and path assignment, control unit, and device in the configuration.

IOCP for IBM z16 provides support for the following features:

7.4.2  Base CPC features and functions

In this section, we describe the features and functions of Base CPC.

HiperDispatch

The HIPERDISPATCH=YES/NO parameter in the IEAOPTxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB and on the SET OPT=xx command controls whether HiperDispatch is enabled or disabled for a z/OS image. It can be changed dynamically, without an IPL or any outage.

In z/OS, the IEAOPTxx keyword HIPERDISPATCH defaults to YES when it is running on an IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM IBM z14system.

In z/OS, the IEAOPTxx keyword HIPERDISPATCH defaults to YES when it is running on an IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM IBM z14system.

The use of SMT on IBM z16 systems requires that HiperDispatch is enabled on the operating system. For more information, see 'Simultaneous multithreading' on page 273.

Also, any LPAR that is running with more than 64 logical processors is required to operate in HiperDispatch Management Mode.

HiperDispatch on IBM z16 systems uses chip and CPC drawer configuration to improve the access cache performance. It optimizes the system PU allocation with Chip/cluster/drawer cache structure on IBM Z servers.

The base support for IBM z16 is provided by PTFs that are identified by:

IBM.device.server.IBM z16-3931.requiredservice

PR/SM on IBM z16 servers preferentially assigns memory for a system in one CPC drawer that is striped across the clusters of that drawer to take advantage of the lower latency memory access in a drawer. Also, PR/SM tries to consolidate storage onto drawers with the most processor entitlement.



--- Chunk 7249 ---
triped across the clusters of that drawer to take advantage of the lower latency memory access in a drawer. Also, PR/SM tries to consolidate storage onto drawers with the most processor entitlement.

With HiperDispatch enabled, PR/SM seeks to assign logical processors of a partition to the smallest number of PU chips within a drawer in cooperation with operating system to optimize shared cache usage.

PR/SM automatically keeps a partition's memory and logical processors on the same CPC drawer where possible. This arrangement looks simple for a partition, but it is a complex optimization for multiple logical partitions because some must be split among processors drawers.

All IBM z16 processor types can be dynamically reassigned except IFPs.

To use HiperDispatch effectively, WLM goal adjustment might be required. Review the WLM policies and goals and update them as necessary.



--- Chunk 7250 ---
6 processor types can be dynamically reassigned except IFPs.

To use HiperDispatch effectively, WLM goal adjustment might be required. Review the WLM policies and goals and update them as necessary.

WLM policies can be changed without turning off HiperDispatch. A health check is provided to verify whether HiperDispatch is enabled on a system image.

z/VM V7R3, V7R2 and V7R1

z/VM also uses the HiperDispatch facility for improved processor efficiency by better use of the processor cache to take advantage of the cache-rich PU chip, node, and drawer design of the IBM z16 system.

CPU polarization support in Linux on IBM Z

You can optimize the operation of a vertical SMP environment by adjusting the SMP factor based on the workload demands. For more information about CPU polarization support in Linux on IBM Z, see this IBM Documentation web page.

z/TPF

z/TPF on IBM z16 can use more processors immediately without reactivating the LPAR or IPLing the z/TPF system.



--- Chunk 7251 ---
PU polarization support in Linux on IBM Z, see this IBM Documentation web page.

z/TPF

z/TPF on IBM z16 can use more processors immediately without reactivating the LPAR or IPLing the z/TPF system.

When z/TPF is running in a shared processor configuration, the achieved MIPS is higher when z/TPF uses a minimum set of processors.

In low-use periods, z/TPF minimizes the processor footprint by compressing TPF workload onto a minimal set of I-streams (engines), which reduces the effect on other LPARs and allows the entire CPC to operate more efficiently.

As a consequence, z/OS and z/VM experience less contention from the z/TPF system when the z/TPF system is operating at periods of low demand.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

The use of a zIIP is transparent to application programs. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253.

On IBM z16 servers, the zIIP processor is designed to run in SMT mode, with up to two threads per processor. This function is designed to help improve throughput for zIIP workloads and provide appropriate performance measurement, capacity planning, and SMF accounting data. zIIP support is available on all currently supported z/OS versions.

Use the PROJECTCPU option of the IEAOPTxx parmlib member to help determine whether zIIPs can be beneficial to the installation. Setting PROJECTCPU=YES directs z/OS to record the amount of eligible work for zIIPs in SMF record type 72 subtype 3.

The field APPL% IIPCP of the Workload Activity Report listing by WLM service class indicates the percentage of a processor that is zIIP eligible. Because of the zIIP's lower price as compared to a CP, even a utilization as low as 10% can provide cost benefits.

Transactional Execution 4

Transactional Execution (TX) is known in academia and industry as hardware transactional memory . Transactional execution is implemented on IBM Z servers.

This feature enables software to indicate to the hardware the beginning and end of a group of instructions that must be treated in an atomic way. All of their results occur or none occur, in true transactional style. The execution is optimistic.



--- Chunk 7456 ---
e hardware the beginning and end of a group of instructions that must be treated in an atomic way. All of their results occur or none occur, in true transactional style. The execution is optimistic.

The hardware provides a memory area to record the original contents of affected registers and memory as instruction execution occurs. If the transactional execution group is canceled or must be rolled back, the hardware transactional memory is used to reset the values. Software can implement a fallback capability.

This capability increases the software's efficiency by providing a way to avoid locks (lock elision). This advantage is of special importance for speculative code generation and highly parallelized applications.

TX is used by IBM Java virtual machine (JVM) and might be used by other software. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

System Recovery Boost

System Recovery Boost is a feature that was implemented on the IBM z15 system. The feature provides more temporary processor capacity and delivers substantially faster system shutdown and restart and critical system operations, such as stand-alone dump, short duration Recovery process boost for sysplex events, and fast catch-up of an accumulated backlog of critical workload after a planned or unplanned event.

Added or increased IBM software costs are not incurred by using System Recovery Boost. With the IBM z16 system, more Recovery process boost scenarios are supported that allow the customer to define some boost granularity (see Table 7-14). For more information, see IBM Z System Recovery Boost , REDP-5563.

- a. Boost must be enabled for LPARs to opt in.
- b. Subcapacity Boost also is available for stand-alone memory dump on z/OS and z/VSE.
- c. With Fixes.
- d. Subcapacity boost might be available during the boost period to guest operating systems, except for z/OS.
- e. Allows CP work to be dispatched on zIIPs. zIIP processor capacity boost is available only if the customer has at least one active processor that is characterized as zIIP. For IBM z16l A01 and IBM z15 T01 only, more zIIPs can be used if obtained through eBOD (temporary zIIP boost records).
- f. Process recovery boosts support subcapacity CPs speed boost and entitled (purchased) customer zIIPs only; zIIPs that are provided by FC 9930 and FC 6802 cannot be used for process recovery boosts.

The client's automation product can be used to automate and control the following System Recovery Boost activities:

- /SM590000 To activate and deactivate the eBod temporary capacity record to provide more physical zIIPs for an IPL or Shutdown Boost.
- /SM590000 To dynamically modify LPAR weights, as might be needed to modify sharing physical zIIP capacity during a Boost period.
- /SM590000 To drive the invocation of the PROC that indicates the beginning of a shutdown process (and the start of the shut-down Boost).
- /SM590000 To take advantage of new composite hardware API reconfiguration actions.
- /SM590000 To control the level of parallelism that is present in the workload at startup (for example, starting middleware regions) and shutdown (for example, performing an orderly shutdown of middleware).

rallelism that is present in the workload at startup (for example, starting middleware regions) and shutdown (for example, performing an orderly shutdown of middleware).

Simultaneous multithreading

SMT is the hardware capability to process up to two simultaneous threads in a single core, which shares the resources of the core, such as cache, translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and execution resources. This sharing improves system capacity and efficiency by reducing processor delays, which increases the overall throughput of the system.

SMT 5  is supported for zIIPs and IFLs.

Note: For zIIPs and IFLs, SMT must be enabled on z/OS, z/VM, or Linux on IBM Z instances. An operating system with SMT support can be configured to dispatch work to a thread on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM) core in single-thread or SMT mode.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

ead on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM) core in single-thread or SMT mode.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

An operating system that uses SMT controls each core and is responsible for maximizing its throughput and meeting workload goals with the smallest number of cores. In z/OS, consider HiperDispatch cache optimization when you must choose the two threads to be dispatched in the same processor.

HiperDispatch attempts to dispatch guest virtual CPUs on the same logical processor on which they ran. PR/SM attempts to dispatch a vertical low logical processor in the same physical processor. If that process is not possible, it attempts to dispatch it in the same node, or then the same CPC drawer where it was dispatched before to maximize cache reuse.

ssor in the same physical processor. If that process is not possible, it attempts to dispatch it in the same node, or then the same CPC drawer where it was dispatched before to maximize cache reuse.

From the perspective of an application, SMT is transparent and no changes are required in the application for it to run in an SMT environment, as shown in Figure 7-1.

z/OS

The use of SMT on z/OS requires enabling HiperDispatch, and defining the processor view ( PROCVIEW ) control statement in the LOADxx parmlib member and the MT\_ZIIP\_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx parmlib member.

The PROCVIEW statement is defined for the life of IPL, and can have the following values:



--- Chunk 7464 ---

The PROCVIEW statement is defined for the life of IPL, and can have the following values:

- /SM590000 CORE : This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core, in which a core can include one or more threads. The number of threads is limited by IBM z16 to two threads. If the underlying hardware does not support SMT, a core is limited to one thread.
- /SM590000 CPU : This value is the default. It specifies that z/OS should configure a traditional processor view of CPU and not use SMT.
- /SM590000 CORE,CPU\_OK : This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core (as with the CORE value) but the CPU parameter is accepted as an alias for applicable commands.

When PROCVIEW CORE or CORE,CPU\_OK are specified in z/OS that is running on an IBM z16, HiperDispatch is forced to run as enabled, and you cannot disable HiperDispatch. The PROCVIEW statement cannot be changed dynamically; therefore, you must re-IPL after changing it to make the new setting effective.

 forced to run as enabled, and you cannot disable HiperDispatch. The PROCVIEW statement cannot be changed dynamically; therefore, you must re-IPL after changing it to make the new setting effective.

The MT\_ZIIP\_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx controls zIIP SMT mode. It can be 1 (the default), where only one thread can be running in a core, or 2 , where up two threads can be running in a core. If PROCVIEW CPU is specified, the MT\_ZIIP\_MODE is always 1 . Otherwise, the use of SMT to dispatch two threads in a single zIIP logical processor ( MT\_ZIIP\_MODE=2 ) can be changed dynamically by using the SET OPT=xx setting in the IEAOPTxx parmlib. Changing the MT mode for all cores can take some time to complete.

PROCVIEW CORE requires DISPLAY M=CORE and CONFIG CORE to display the core states and configure an entire core.

PROCVIEW CORE requires DISPLAY M=CORE and CONFIG CORE to display the core states and configure an entire core.

With the introduction of Multi-Threading support for SAPs, a maximum of 88 logical SAPs can be used. RMF is updated to support this change by implementing page break support in the I/O Queuing Activity report that is generated by the RMF Post processor.

z/VM V7R3, V7R2, and V7R1

The use of SMT in z/VM is enabled by using the MULTITHREADING statement in the system configuration file. Multithreading is enabled only if z/VM is configured to run with the HiperDispatch vertical polarization mode enabled and with the dispatcher work distribution mode set to reshuffle.



--- Chunk 7468 ---
iguration file. Multithreading is enabled only if z/VM is configured to run with the HiperDispatch vertical polarization mode enabled and with the dispatcher work distribution mode set to reshuffle.

The default in z/VM is multithreading disabled. Dynamic SMT enables dynamically varying the active threads per core. The number of active threads per core can be changed dynamically without a system outage and potential capacity gains going from SMT-1 to SMT-2 (one to two threads per core) can be achieved dynamically.

z/VM V7R3, V7R2, and V7R1 support up to 40 multithreaded cores (80 threads) for IFLs, and each thread is treated as an independent processor. z/VM dispatches virtual IFLs on the IFL logical processor so that the same or different guests can share a core. Each core has a single dispatch vector, and z/VM attempts to place virtual sibling IFLs on the same dispatch vector to maximize cache reuses.



--- Chunk 7469 ---
r so that the same or different guests can share a core. Each core has a single dispatch vector, and z/VM attempts to place virtual sibling IFLs on the same dispatch vector to maximize cache reuses.

z/VM guests have no awareness of SMT, and cannot use it directly. z/VM SMT use does not include guest support for multithreading. The value of this support for guests is that the first-level z/VM host of the guests can achieve higher throughput from the multi-threaded IFL cores.

Linux on IBM Z and the KVM hypervisor

The Linux kernel features SMT functions that were developed by the Linux on IBM Z development team. SMT is supported on LPAR only (not as a second-level guest).

Single-instruction multiple-data

The SIMD feature introduces a new set of instructions to enable parallel computing that can accelerate code with string, character, integer, and floating point data types. The SIMD instructions allow many operands to be processed with a single complex instruction.



--- Chunk 7471 ---
rallel computing that can accelerate code with string, character, integer, and floating point data types. The SIMD instructions allow many operands to be processed with a single complex instruction.

IBM z16 is equipped with a set of instructions to improve the performance of complex mathematical models and analytic workloads through vector processing and complex instructions, which can process numerous data with a single instruction. This set of instructions, which is known as SIMD, enables more consolidation of analytic workloads and business transactions on IBM Z servers.

SIMD on IBM z16 has support for enhanced math libraries that provide performance improvements for analytical workloads by processing more information with a single CPU instruction.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. Operating System support includes the following features 6 :



--- Chunk 7472 ---
nformation with a single CPU instruction.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. Operating System support includes the following features 6 :

- /SM590000 Enablement of vector registers.
- /SM590000 A math library with an optimized and tuned math function (Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem [MASS]) that can be used in place of some of the C standard math functions. It includes a SIMD vectorized and nonvectorized version.
- /SM590000 A specialized math library, which is known as Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS), that is optimized for the hardware.
- /SM590000 IBM Language Environmentfi for C runtime function enablement for ATLAS.
- /SM590000 DBX to support the disassembly of the new vector instructions, and to display and set vector registers.
- /SM590000 XML SS exploitation to use new vector processing instructions to improve performance.



--- Chunk 7473 ---
 to support the disassembly of the new vector instructions, and to display and set vector registers.
- /SM590000 XML SS exploitation to use new vector processing instructions to improve performance.

MASS and ATLAS can reduce the time and effort for middleware and application developers. IBM provides compiler built-in functions for SIMD that software applications can use as needed, such as for using string instructions.

The use of new hardware instructions require the z/OS V2R5 XL C/C++ compiler with ARCH(14) and TUNE(14) options for targeting IBM z16 instructions. The ARCH(14) compiler option allows the compiler to use any new IBM z16 instructions where suitable. The TUNE(14) compiler option allows the compiler to tune for any IBM z16 micro-architecture.

Vector programming support is extended for IBM z16 to provide access to the new instructions that were introduced by the VEF 2 7 specification.

 compiler to tune for any IBM z16 micro-architecture.

Vector programming support is extended for IBM z16 to provide access to the new instructions that were introduced by the VEF 2 7 specification.

Older levels of z/OS XL C/C++ compilers do not provide IBM z16 exploitation; however, the z/OS V2R5 XL C/C++ compiler can be used to generate code for the older levels of z/OS running on IBM z16.

The followings compilers include built-in functions for SIMD:

- /SM590000 IBM Java
- /SM590000 XL C/C++
- /SM590000 Enterprise COBOL
- /SM590000 Enterprise PL/I

Code must be developed to use the SIMD functions. Applications with SIMD instructions abend if they run on a lower hardware level system that do not support SIMD. Some mathematical function replacement can be done without code changes by including the scalar MASS library before the standard math library.



--- Chunk 7475 ---
a lower hardware level system that do not support SIMD. Some mathematical function replacement can be done without code changes by including the scalar MASS library before the standard math library.

Because the MASS and standard math library include different accuracies, assess the accuracy of the functions in the context of the user application before deciding whether to use the MASS and ATLAS libraries.

The SIMD functions can be disabled in z/OS partitions at IPL time by using the MACHMIG parameter in the LOADxx member. To disable SIMD code, use the MACHMIG VEF hardware-based vector facility. If you do not specify a MACHMIG statement, which is the default, the system not limited in its use of the Vector Facility for z/Architecture (SIMD).

Hardware decimal floating point

Industry support for decimal floating point is growing, with IBM leading the open standard definition. Examples of support for the draft standard IEEE 754r include Java BigDecimal, C#, XML, C/C++, GCC, COBOL, and other key software vendors, such as Microsoft and SAP.

IBM z16 introduces COBOL optimization for Hexadecimal Floating Point (HFP) &lt;--&gt; Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) conversion, and Numeric Editing, and Zoned Decimal operations.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. For more information, see 7.5.8, 'z/OS XL C/C++ considerations' on page 321.

Out-of-order execution

Out-of-order (OOO) execution yields significant performance benefits for compute-intensive applications by reordering instruction execution, which allows later (newer) instructions to be run ahead of a stalled instruction, and reordering storage accesses and parallel storage accesses. OOO maintains good performance growth for traditional applications.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. For more information, see '3.4.3, 'Out-of-Order execution' on page 81.

The Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort is an on chip hardware feature that is available on IBM z15 and newer servers. It is driven by the SORT LISTS (SORTL) instruction.

z/OS DFSORT takes advantage of Z Sort, and provides users with significant performance boosts for their sort workloads. With z/OS DFSORT's Z Sort algorithm, clients can see batch sort job elapsed time improvements of up to 20 - 30% (depending on record size) and CPU time improvements of up to 40% compared to IBM z14.

The function is used on z/OS V2.R5 and enabled on z/OS V2.R4 and V2.R3 with PTFs for APAR PH03207.

SMF 0 records were enhanced to indicate the number of crypto counters that are supported by the current IBM Z hardware.

SMF 30 records were enhanced to include new crypto counter sections that contain counters for CPACF cryptographic instructions that are used by a job in a specific period. These sections are produced only for those instructions that are used.

These counters are correlated with z/OS jobs and users for the determination of the algorithms, bit lengths, and key security that is used by a specific workload. This data can aid in compliance, performance, and configuration.

The SMF 30 self-defining section indicates the length and number of crypto counter sections.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

Instruction Execution Protection

Instruction Execution Protection (IEP) is a hardware function that enables software, such as Language Environment, to mark specific memory regions (for example, a heap or stack), as nonexecutable to improve the security of programs that are running on IBM Z servers against stack-overflow or similar attacks.

Through enhanced hardware features (based on DAT table entry bit) and specific software requests to obtain memory areas as nonexecutable, areas of memory can be protected from unauthorized execution. A Protection Exception occurs if an attempt is made to fetch an instruction from an address in such an element or if an address in such an element is the target of an execute-type instruction.

To use IEP, Real Storage Manager (RSM) is enhanced to request nonexecutable memory allocation. Use new keyword EXECUTABLE=YES|NO on STORAGE OBTAIN or IARV64 to indicate whether memory that is to be used contains executable code. Recovery Termination Manager (RTM) writes LOGREC record of any program-check that results from IEP.

IEP support is for z/OS V2.R2 and later running on IBM z16 with APARs OA51030 and OA51643 installed.

Note: The zEDC Express feature that is available on older systems is not carried forward to IBM z16.

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC maintains software compatibility with zEDC Express use cases. For more information, see Integrated Acceleratorfor zEnterprise Data Compression .

The z/OS zEDC capability is a software-priced feature that is designed to support compression capable hardware.

7.4.3  Coupling and clustering features and functions

In this section, we describe the coupling and cluster features.

Coupling facility and CFCC considerations

Coupling facility (CF) connectivity to an IBM z16 is supported on the z16, IBM z14, or another IBM z16. The CFCC levels that are supported on IBM Z are listed in Table 7-15.

z14, or another IBM z16. The CFCC levels that are supported on IBM Z are listed in Table 7-15.

<!-- missing-text -->

- a. CFCC Level 22 is not supported when an IBM z16 participates in the sysplex

Consideration: Because coupling link connectivity on IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 ZR1 do not support InfiniBand, you must carefully plan your configuration if IBM z14 M0x systems with InfiniBand coupling are present in your configuration. Also, consider the level of CFCC. For more information, see 'Migration considerations' on page 191.

CFCC Level 25

CFCC Level 25 is delivered on IBM z16 servers with driver level 51 and introduces the following enhancements:

- /SM590000 Scalability Improvements

Processing and dispatching enhancements that result in meaningful scaling of effective throughput up to the limit of 16 ICF processors.

- /SM590000 Request latency/performance improvements

CFCC and coupling link firmware and hardware improvements to reduce link latency.

CFCC and coupling link firmware and hardware improvements to reduce link latency.

- /SM590000 Elimination of VSAM RLS orphaned cast-out lock problems and improved VSAM RLS Structure Full recovery processing.

Addresses reoccurring problems that are encountered by installations running VSAM RLS data sharing.

Retry Buffer support that is used on list and lock commands is extended to nonidempotent cache commands and optimized lock commands.

The new support also allows connectors to lock structures to specify a percentage of record data entries to be reserved. These reserved entries are off limits to normal requests to the coupling facility and can be used only if a new keyword is used on lock requests that generate record data entries.

- /SM590000 Cache residency time metrics

The CF calculates in microseconds by way of a moving weighted average the elapsed time a data area or directory entry resides in a storage class before it is reclaimed. XES returns this information on an IXLCACHE REQUEST=READSTGSTATS and IXLMG STRNAME=strname,STGCLASS=stgclass request.

- /SM590000 DYNDISP=ON|OFF is deprecated

For CFCC Level 25, DYNDISP=THIN is the only available behavior for shared-engine CF dispatching.

Specifying OFF or ON in CF commands and the CF configuration file is preserved for compatibility, but a warning message is issued to indicate that these options are no longer supported, and that DYNDISP=THIN behavior is to be used.

Before you begin the migration process, install the compatibility and coexistence PTFs. A planned outage is required when you upgrade the CF or CF LPAR to CFCC Level 25.

CFCC Level 24

CFCC Level 24 is delivered on IBM z16 servers with driver level 41. CFCC Level 24 introduced the following enhancements:

- /SM590000 CFCC Fair Latch Manager

This enhancement to the internals of the Coupling Facility (CFCC) dispatcher provides CF work management efficiency and processor scalability improvements. It also improves the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks

/SM590000 CFCC Message Path Resiliency



--- Chunk 7518 ---
ork management efficiency and processor scalability improvements. It also improves the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks

/SM590000 CFCC Message Path Resiliency

CF Message Paths use a z/OS-provided system identifier (SYID) to uniquely identify which z/OS system image (and instance of that system image) is sending requests over a message path to the CF. With IBM z15, we are providing a new resiliency mechanism that transparently recovers for this 'missing' message path deactivate (if and when that deactivation ever occurs).

During path initialization, the CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active, including the SYID for the path. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness, and if incorrect, gather diagnostic information and reactivates the path to correct the problem.

/SM590000 CF monopolization avoidance



--- Chunk 7519 ---
/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness, and if incorrect, gather diagnostic information and reactivates the path to correct the problem.

/SM590000 CF monopolization avoidance

z/OS takes advantage of current CF support in CFLEVEL 24 (IBM z15 T01/T02) to deliver improved z/OS support for handling CF monopolization.

With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher monitors in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a specific structure on a structure-by-structure basis.

When the number of CF tasks that is used by any structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks also is exceeded, the structure is considered to be 'monopolizing' the CF. z/OS is informed of this monopolization.



--- Chunk 7520 ---
model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks also is exceeded, the structure is considered to be 'monopolizing' the CF. z/OS is informed of this monopolization.

New support in z/OS observes the monopolization state for a structure, and starts to selectively queue and throttle incoming requests to the CF on a structure-specific basis. Other requests for other 'non-monopolizing' structures and workloads are unaffected.

z/OS dynamically manages the queue of requests for the 'monopolizing' structures to limit the number of active CF requests (parallelism) to them, and monitors the CF's monopolization state information so as to observe the structure becoming 'non-monopolized' again, so that request processing can eventually revert back to a non-throttled mode of operation.



--- Chunk 7521 ---
the CF's monopolization state information so as to observe the structure becoming 'non-monopolized' again, so that request processing can eventually revert back to a non-throttled mode of operation.

The overall goal of z/OS anti-monopolization support is to protect the ability of ALL well-behaved structures and workloads to access the CF, and get their requests processed in the CF in a timely fashion. At the same time, it implements queuing and throttling mechanisms in z/OS to hold back the specific abusive workloads that are causing problems for other workloads.

z/OS XCF/XES use of APAR support is required to provide this function.

- /SM590000 CFCC Change Shared-Engine CF Default to DYNDISP=THIN

Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Shared processor CFs can operate with different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:



--- Chunk 7522 ---
 Shared-Engine CF Default to DYNDISP=THIN

Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Shared processor CFs can operate with different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:

- -DYNDISP=OFF : LPAR timeslicing controls the CF processor.
- -DYNDISP=ON : An optimization over pure LPAR timeslicing, in which the CFCC code manages timer interrupts to share processors more efficiently.
- -DYNDISP=THIN : An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts.

Thin Interrupt support was available since zEC12/zBC12,. It is proven to be efficient and well-performing in numerous different test and customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations.

Therefore, IBM z15 made DYNDISP=THIN the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.

Therefore, IBM z15 made DYNDISP=THIN the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.

CFCC Level 23

CFCC Level 23 is delivered on IBM IBM z14 servers with driver level 36. In addition to CFCC Level 22 enhancements, it introduces the following enhancements:

- /SM590000 Asynchronous cross invalidation (XI) for CF cache structures

This enhancement requires z/OS fixes for APARs OA54688 (exploitation) and OA54985 (toleration). It also requires specific data manager support (Db2 V12 with PTFs).

- /SM590000 Coupling Facility hang detection

These enhancements provide a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability. With this support, the CFCC dispatcher significantly reduces the CF hang detection interval to only 2 seconds, which allows more timely detection and recovery from such events.



--- Chunk 7524 ---
ollection capability. With this support, the CFCC dispatcher significantly reduces the CF hang detection interval to only 2 seconds, which allows more timely detection and recovery from such events.

When a hang is detected, in most cases the CF confines the scope of the failure to 'structure damage' for the single CF structure the hung command was processing against, captures diagnostics with a nondisruptive CF dump, and continues operating without stopping or rebooting the CF image.

- /SM590000 Coupling Facility granular latching

This enhancement eliminates the performance degradation that is caused by structure-wide latching. With this support, most CF list and lock structure ECR processing no longer uses structure-wide latching. It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use. However, a few 'edge conditions' in ECR processing still require structure-wide latching.

For more information about the latest CFCC code levels, see the current exception letter that is published on Resource Link website (login is required).

CF structure sizing changes are expected when upgrading from a previous CFCC Level to CFCC Level 25. In fact, CFLEVEL 25 can have more noticeable CF structure size increases associated with it, especially for smaller structures, because of task-related memory increases that are associated with the increased number of CF tasks in CFLEVEL 25

Review the CF LPAR size by using the CFSizer tool.

Alternatively, the batch SIZER utility also can be used for re-sizing your CF structures as needed. Make sure to update CFRM Policy INITISIZE or SIZE values as needed.

Coupling links support

Integrated Coupling Adapter (ICA) Short Reach and Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR) coupling link options provide high-speed connectivity at short and longer distances over fiber optic interconnections.

Virtual Flash Memory use by CFCC

VFM can be used in coupling facility images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures. The use of VFM can help availability by reducing latency from paging delays that can occur at the start of the workday or during other transitional periods. It is also helps to eliminate delays that can occur when diagnostic data during failures is collected.

Asynchronous CF Duplexing for lock structures

Asynchronous CF Duplexing enhancement is a general-purpose interface for any CF Lock structure user. It enables secondary structure updates to be performed asynchronously from primary CF updates. It offers performance advantages for duplexing lock structures and avoids the need for synchronous communication delays during the processing of every duplexed update operation.

- /SM590000 Db2 V12 with PTFs for APAR PI66689
- /SM590000 IRLM V2.R3 with PTFs for APAR PI68378

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-5 on page 256.

Asynchronous cross-invalidate for CF cache structures

Asynchronous cross-invalidate (XI) for CF cache structures enables improved efficiency in CF data sharing by adopting a more transactional behavior for cross-invalidate (XI) processing. This processing is used to maintain coherency and consistency of data managers' local buffer pools across the sysplex.



--- Chunk 7530 ---
by adopting a more transactional behavior for cross-invalidate (XI) processing. This processing is used to maintain coherency and consistency of data managers' local buffer pools across the sysplex.

Instead of performing XI signals synchronously on every cache update request that causes them, data managers can 'opt in' for the CF to perform these XIs asynchronously (and then synchronize them with the CF at or before the transaction is completed). Data integrity is maintained if all XI signals complete by the time transaction locks are released.

The feature enables faster completion of cache update CF requests, especially with the cross-site distance that is involved. It also provides improved cache structure service times and coupling efficiency. It requires specific data manager use or participation, which is not transparent to the data manager. No SMF data changes were made for CF monitoring and reporting.

The following requirements must be met:

z/VM Dynamic I/O support for ICA CHPIDs

z/VM dynamic I/O configuration support allows you to add, delete, and modify the definitions of channel paths, control units, and I/O devices to the server and z/VM without shutting down the system.

This function refers exclusively to the z/VM dynamic I/O support of InfiniBand 9  and ICA coupling links. Support is available for the CIB and CS5 CHPID type in the z/VM dynamic commands, including the change channel path dynamic I/O command.

7.4.4  Storage connectivity-related features and functions

In this section, we describe the storage connectivity-related features and functions.

zHyperlink Express

IBM IBM z14 introduced IBM zHyperLink Express as a brand new IBM Z input/output (I/O) channel link technology since FICON. The zHyperLink Express 1.1 feature is available with new IBM z16 systems and is designed to help bring data close to processing power, increase the scalability of transaction processing, and lower I/O latency.



--- Chunk 7533 ---
ink Express 1.1 feature is available with new IBM z16 systems and is designed to help bring data close to processing power, increase the scalability of transaction processing, and lower I/O latency.

zHyperLink Express is designed for up to 5x lower latency than High-Performance FICON for IBM Z (zHPF) by directly connecting the IBM Z central processor complex (CPC) to the I/O Bay of the DS8000 (DS8880 or later). This short distance (up to 150 m [492.1 feet]), direct connection is intended to speed Db2 for z/OS transaction processing and improve active log throughput.

The improved performance of zHyperLink Express allows the Processing Unit (PU) to make a synchronous request for the data that is in the DS8000 cache. This process eliminates the undispatch of the running request, the queuing delays to resume the request, and the PU cache disruption.

Extended distance FICON

An enhancement to the industry-standard FICON architecture (FC-SB-3) helps avoid degradation of performance at extended distances by implementing a new protocol for persistent IU pacing. Extended distance FICON is transparent to operating systems and applies to all FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features that carry native FICON traffic (CHPID type FC).

To use this enhancement, the control unit must support the new IU pacing protocol. IBM System Storage DS8000 series supports extended distance FICON for IBM Z environments. The channel defaults to current pacing values when it operates with control units that cannot use extended distance FICON.

High-performance FICON



--- Chunk 7541 ---
rts extended distance FICON for IBM Z environments. The channel defaults to current pacing values when it operates with control units that cannot use extended distance FICON.

High-performance FICON

High-performance FICON (zHPF) was first provided on IBM System z10fi, and is a FICON architecture for protocol simplification and efficiency. It reduces the number of information units (IUs) that are processed. Enhancements were made to the z/Architecture and the FICON interface architecture to provide optimizations for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads.

zHPF is available on the following servers:

- /SM590000 IBM z16
- /SM590000 IBM z15
- /SM590000 IBM z14
- /SM590000 IBM z13
- /SM590000 IBM z13sfi
- /SM590000 IBM zEC12
- /SM590000 IBM zBC12

As of this writing, the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+(CHPID type FC) support the FICON protocol and the zHPF protocol in the server LIC.



--- Chunk 7542 ---
IBM zEC12

As of this writing, the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+(CHPID type FC) support the FICON protocol and the zHPF protocol in the server LIC.

When used by the FICON channel, the z/OS operating system, and the DS8000 control unit or other subsystems, the FICON channel processor usage can be reduced and performance improved. Suitable levels of Licensed Internal Code (LIC) are required.

Also, the changes to the architectures provide end-to-end system enhancements to improve reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS).

zHPF is compatible with the following standards:

- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling standard (FC-FS)
- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Switch Fabric and Switch Control Requirements (FC-SW)
- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Single-Byte-4 (FC-SB-4) standards

For example, the zHPF channel programs can be used by the z/OS OLTP I/O workloads, Db2, VSAM, the partitioned data set extended (PDSE), and the z/OS file system (zFS).

At the zHPF announcement, zHPF supported the transfer of small blocks of fixed size data (4 K) from a single track. This capability was extended, first to 64 KB, and then to multi-track operations. The 64 KB data transfer limit on multi-track operations was removed by z196. This improvement allows the channel to fully use the bandwidth of FICON channels, which results in higher throughputs and lower response times.



--- Chunk 7544 ---
r limit on multi-track operations was removed by z196. This improvement allows the channel to fully use the bandwidth of FICON channels, which results in higher throughputs and lower response times.

The multi-track operations extension applies to the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+, when configured as CHPID type FC and connecting to z/OS. zHPF requires matching support by the DS8000 series. Otherwise, the extended multi-track support is transparent to the control unit.

zHPF is enhanced to allow all large write operations (greater than 64 KB) at distances up to 100 km (62.13 miles) to be run in a single round trip to the control unit. This process does not elongate the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances. This enhancement to zHPF removes a key inhibitor for customers that are adopting zHPF over extended distances, especially when the IBM HyperSwap capability of z/OS is used.

From the z/OS perspective, the FICON architecture is called command mode and the zHPF architecture is called transport mode . During link initialization, the channel node and the control unit node indicate whether they support zHPF.

Requirement: All FICON channel path identifiers (CHPIDs) that are defined to the same LCU must support zHPF. The inclusion of any non-compliant zHPF features in the path group causes the entire path group to support command mode only.

identifiers (CHPIDs) that are defined to the same LCU must support zHPF. The inclusion of any non-compliant zHPF features in the path group causes the entire path group to support command mode only.

The mode that is used for an I/O operation depends on the control unit that supports zHPF and its settings in the z/OS operating system. For z/OS use, a parameter is available in the IECIOSxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB ( ZHPF=YES or NO ) and in the SETIOS system command to control whether zHPF is enabled or disabled. The default is ZHPF=NO .

Support also is added for the D IOS,ZHPF system command to indicate whether zHPF is enabled, disabled, or not supported on the server.

Similar to the existing FICON channel architecture, the application or access method provides the channel program (CCWs). How zHPF (transport mode) manages channel program operations is different from the CCW operation for the existing FICON architecture (command mode).

While in command mode, each CCW is sent to the control unit for execution. In transport mode, multiple channel commands are packaged together and sent over the link to the control unit in a single control block. Fewer processors are used compared to the existing FICON architecture. Specific complex CCW chains are not supported by zHPF.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.

Modified Indirect Data Address Word facility

The Modified Indirect Data Address Word (MIDAW) facility improves FICON performance. It provides a more efficient channel command word (CCW)/indirect data address word (IDAW) structure for specific categories of data-chaining I/O operations.

The MIDAW facility is a system architecture and software feature that is designed to improve FICON performance. This facility was first made available on IBM System z9fi servers, and is used by the Media Manager in z/OS.

The MIDAW facility provides a more efficient CCW/IDAW structure for certain categories of data-chaining I/O operations.

MIDAW can improve FICON performance for extended format data sets. Nonextended data sets also can benefit from MIDAW.

MIDAW can improve FICON performance for extended format data sets. Nonextended data sets also can benefit from MIDAW.

MIDAW can improve channel use and I/O response time. It also reduces FICON channel connect time, director ports, and control unit processor usage.

IBM laboratory tests indicate that applications that use EF data sets, such as Db2, or long chains of small blocks can gain significant performance benefits by using the MIDAW facility.

MIDAW is supported on FICON channels that are configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.

MIDAW technical description

MIDAW is supported on FICON channels that are configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.

MIDAW technical description

An IDAW is used to specify data addresses for I/O operations in a virtual environment. 10 The IDAW design allows the first IDAW in a list to point to any address within a page. Subsequent IDAWs in the same list must point to the first byte in a page. Also, IDAWs (except the first and last IDAW) in a list must manage complete 2 K or 4 K units of data.

Figure 7-2 shows a single CCW that controls the transfer of data that spans noncontiguous 4 K frames in main storage. When the IDAW flag is set, the data address in the CCW points to a list of words (IDAWs). Each IDAW contains an address that designates a data area within real storage.

The number of required IDAWs for a CCW is determined by the following factors:

The number of required IDAWs for a CCW is determined by the following factors:

- /SM590000 IDAW format as specified in the operation request block (ORB)
- /SM590000 Count field of the CCW
- /SM590000 Data address in the initial IDAW

For example, three IDAWS are required when the following events occur:

- /SM590000 The ORB specifies format-2 IDAWs with 4 KB blocks.
- /SM590000 The CCW count field specifies 8 KB.
- /SM590000 The first IDAW designates a location in the middle of a 4 KB block.

- /SM590000 The ORB specifies format-2 IDAWs with 4 KB blocks.
- /SM590000 The CCW count field specifies 8 KB.
- /SM590000 The first IDAW designates a location in the middle of a 4 KB block.

CCWs with data chaining can be used to process I/O data blocks that have a more complex internal structure, in which portions of the data block are directed into separate buffer areas. This process is sometimes known as scatter-read or scatter-write . However, as technology evolves and link speed increases, data chaining techniques become less efficient because of switch fabrics, control unit processing and exchanges, and other issues.

The MIDAW facility is a method of gathering and scattering data from and into discontinuous storage locations during an I/O operation. The MIDAW format is shown in Figure 7-3. It is 16 bytes long and aligned on a quadword.

An example of MIDAW usage is shown in Figure 7-4.

The use of MIDAWs is indicated by the MIDAW bit in the CCW. If this bit is set, the skip flag cannot be set in the CCW. The skip flag in the MIDAW can be used instead. The data count in the CCW must equal the sum of the data counts in the MIDAWs. The CCW operation ends when the CCW count goes to zero or the last MIDAW (with the last flag) ends.

The combination of the address and count in a MIDAW cannot cross a page boundary. Therefore, the largest possible count is 4 K. The maximum data count of all the MIDAWs in a list cannot exceed 64 K, which is the maximum count of the associated CCW.

W cannot cross a page boundary. Therefore, the largest possible count is 4 K. The maximum data count of all the MIDAWs in a list cannot exceed 64 K, which is the maximum count of the associated CCW.

The scatter-read or scatter-write effect of the MIDAWs makes it possible to efficiently send small control blocks that are embedded in a disk record to separate buffers from those that are used for larger data areas within the record. MIDAW operations are on a single I/O block, in the manner of data chaining. Do not confuse this operation with CCW command chaining.

Extended format data sets

z/OS extended format (EF) data sets use internal structures (often not visible to the application program) that require a scatter-read (or scatter-write) operation. Therefore, CCW data chaining is required, which produces less than optimal I/O performance. Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here.

ired, which produces less than optimal I/O performance. Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here.

VSAM and non-VSAM (DSORG=PS) sets can be defined as EF data sets. For non-VSAM data sets, a 32-byte suffix is appended to the end of every physical record (that is, block) on disk. VSAM appends the suffix to the end of every control interval (CI), which normally corresponds to a physical record.

A 32 K CI is split into two records to span tracks. This suffix is used to improve data reliability, and facilitates other functions that are described next. For example, if the DCB BLKSIZE or VSAM CI size is equal to 8192, the block on storage consists of 8224 bytes. The control unit does not distinguish between suffixes and user data. The suffix is transparent to the access method and database.

In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following functions:

ntrol unit does not distinguish between suffixes and user data. The suffix is transparent to the access method and database.

In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following functions:

- /SM590000 DFSMS striping
- /SM590000 Access method compression
- /SM590000 Extended addressability (EA)

EA is useful for creating large Db2 partitions (larger than 4 GB). Striping can be used to increase sequential throughput, or to spread random I/Os across multiple logical volumes. DFSMS striping is useful for the use of multiple channels in parallel for one data set. The Db2 logs are often striped to optimize the performance of Db2 sequential inserts.

Processing an I/O operation to an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set. With MIDAW, the extra CCW for the EF data set suffix is eliminated.

 an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set. With MIDAW, the extra CCW for the EF data set suffix is eliminated.

MIDAWs benefit EF and non-EF data sets. For example, to read 12 4 K records from a non-EF data set on a 3390 track, Media Manager chains together 12 CCWs by using data chaining. To read 12 4 K records from an EF data set, 24 CCWs are chained (two CCWs per 4 K record). By using Media Manager track-level command operations and MIDAWs, an entire track can be transferred by using a single CCW.

Performance benefits

z/OS Media Manager includes I/O channel program support for implementing EF data sets, and automatically uses MIDAWs when appropriate. Most disk I/Os in the system are generated by using Media Manager.

S Media Manager includes I/O channel program support for implementing EF data sets, and automatically uses MIDAWs when appropriate. Most disk I/Os in the system are generated by using Media Manager.

Users of the Executing Fixed Channel Programs in Real Storage (EXCPVR) instruction can construct channel programs that contain MIDAWs. However, doing so requires that they construct an IOBE with the IOBEMIDA bit set. Users of the EXCP instruction cannot construct channel programs that contain MIDAWs.

The MIDAW facility removes the 4 K boundary restrictions of IDAWs and for EF data sets, which reduces the number of CCWs. Decreasing the number of CCWs helps to reduce the FICON channel processor use. Media Manager and MIDAWs do not cause the bits to move any faster across the FICON link. However, they reduce the number of frames and sequences that flow across the link and use the channel resources more efficiently.

DAWs do not cause the bits to move any faster across the FICON link. However, they reduce the number of frames and sequences that flow across the link and use the channel resources more efficiently.

The performance of a specific workload can vary based on the conditions and hardware configuration of the environment. IBM laboratory tests found that Db2 gains significant performance benefits by using the MIDAW facility in the following areas:

- /SM590000 Table scans
- /SM590000 Logging
- /SM590000 Utilities
- /SM590000 Use of DFSMS striping for Db2 data sets

Media Manager with the MIDAW facility can provide significant performance benefits when used in combination applications that use EF data sets (such as Db2) or long chains of small blocks.

ICKDSF

Device Support Facilities, ICKDSF, Release 17 is required on all systems that share disk subsystems with an IBM z16 processor.

ICKDSF supports a modified format of the CPU information field that contains a two-digit LPAR identifier. ICKDSF uses the CPU information field instead of CCW reserve/release for concurrent media maintenance. It prevents multiple systems from running ICKDSF on the same volume, and at the same time allows user applications to run while ICKDSF is processing. To prevent data corruption, ICKDSF must determine all sharing systems that might run ICKDSF. Therefore, this support is required for IBM z16.

Remember: The need for ICKDSF Release 17 also applies to systems that are not part of the same sysplex, or are running an operating system other than z/OS, such as z/VM.

z/OS Discovery and Auto-Configuration

z/OS Discovery and Auto-Configuration

z/OS Discovery and Auto Configuration (zDAC) is designed to automatically run several I/O configuration definition tasks for new and changed disk and tape controllers that are connected to a switch or director, when attached to a FICON channel.

The zDAC function is integrated into the hardware configuration definition (HCD). Clients can define a policy that can include preferences for availability and bandwidth that include parallel access volume (PAV) definitions, control unit numbers, and device number ranges. When new controllers are added to an I/O configuration or changes are made to existing controllers, the system discovers them and proposes configuration changes that are based on that policy.

zDAC provides real-time discovery for the FICON fabric, subsystem, and I/O device resource changes from z/OS. By exploring the discovered control units for defined logical control units (LCUs) and devices, zDAC compares the discovered controller information with the current system configuration. It then determines delta changes to the configuration for a proposed configuration.

its (LCUs) and devices, zDAC compares the discovered controller information with the current system configuration. It then determines delta changes to the configuration for a proposed configuration.

All added or changed logical control units and devices are added into the proposed configuration. They are assigned proposed control unit and device numbers, and channel paths that are based on the defined policy. zDAC uses channel path chosen algorithms to minimize single points of failure. The zDAC proposed configurations are created as work I/O definition files (IODFs) that can be converted to production IODFs and activated.

zDAC is designed to run discovery for all systems in a sysplex that support the function. Therefore, zDAC helps to simplify I/O configuration on IBM z16 systems that run z/OS, and reduces complexity and setup time.

The 63.75-K subchannels

Servers before IBM z9 EC reserved 1024 subchannels for internal system use, out of a maximum of 64 K subchannels. Starting with IBM z9 EC, the number of reserved subchannels was reduced to 256, which increased the number of subchannels that are available. Reserved subchannels exist in subchannel set 0 only. One subchannel is reserved in each of subchannel sets 1, 2, and 3.

The informal name, 63.75-K subchannels , represents 65280 subchannels, as shown in the following equation:

63 x 1024 + 0.75 x 1024 = 65280

This equation is applicable for subchannel set 0. For subchannel sets 1, 2 and 3, the available subchannels are derived by using the following equation:

Multiple subchannel sets

First introduced in IBM z9 EC, multiple subchannel sets (MSS) provide a mechanism for addressing more than 63.75 K I/O devices and aliases for FICON (CHPID types FC) on the IBM z16, IBM z15, IBM z14, IBM z13, IBM z13s, IBM zEC12, and IBM zBC12. IBM z196 introduced the third subchannel set (SS2). With IBM z13, one more subchannel set (SS3) was introduced, which expands the alias addressing by 64 K more I/O devices.

Current z/VM versions MSS support for mirrored direct access storage device (DASD) provides a subset of host support for the MSS facility to allow the use of an alternative subchannel set for Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) secondary volumes.

32 K subchannels

To help facilitate growth and continue to enable server consolidation, the IBM z16 supports up to 32 K subchannels per FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ channels (CHPID). More devices can be defined per FICON channel, which includes primary, secondary, and alias devices. The maximum number of subchannels across all device types that are addressable within an LPAR remains at 63.75 K for subchannel set 0 and 64 K (64 X 1024)-1 for subchannel sets 1, 2, and 3.

This support is available to the IBM z16, IBM z15, z14, IBM z13, and IBM z13s servers and applies to the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features (defined as CHPID type FC).

Although change is required in z/OS to support dynamic routing, I/O errors can occur if the FICON switches are configured for dynamic routing despite the missing support in the processor or storage controllers. Therefore, a health check is provided that interrogates the switch to determine whether dynamic routing is enabled in the switch fabric.

No action is required on z/OS to enable the health check; it is automatically enabled at IPL and reacts to changes that might cause problems. The health check can be disabled by using the PARMLIB or SDSF modify commands.

The tool assigns WWPNs to each virtual FCP channel or port by using the same WWPN assignment algorithms that a system uses when assigning WWPNs for channels that use NPIV. Therefore, the SAN can be set up in advance, which allows operations to proceed much faster after the server is installed. In addition, the SAN configuration can be retained instead of altered by assigning the WWPN to physical FCP ports when a FICON feature is replaced.

Similar to SMC-R, this protocol uses shared memory architectural concepts that eliminate TCP/IP processing in the data path, yet preserve TCP/IP Qualities of Service for connection management purposes.

ilar to SMC-R, this protocol uses shared memory architectural concepts that eliminate TCP/IP processing in the data path, yet preserve TCP/IP Qualities of Service for connection management purposes.

Support in select Linux on IBM Z distributions is now provided for Shared Memory Communications over Direct Memory Access (SMC-D). For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Shared Memory Communications Version 2

Shared Memory Communications v2 is available in z/OS V2R4 (with PTFs) and z/OS V2R5.

Because the initial version of SMC was limited to TCP/IP connections over the same layer 2 network, it was not routable across multiple IP subnets. The associated TCP/IP connection was limited to hosts within a single IP subnet that required the hosts to have direct access to the same physical layer 2 network (that is, the same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet.

SMC Version 2 (SMCv2) provides support for SMC over multiple IP subnets for both SMC-D and SMC-R and is referred to as SMC-Dv2 and SMC-Rv2. SMCv2 requires updates to the underlying network technology. SMC-Dv2 requires ISMv2 and SMC-Rv2 requires RoCEv2.

ltiple IP subnets for both SMC-D and SMC-R and is referred to as SMC-Dv2 and SMC-Rv2. SMCv2 requires updates to the underlying network technology. SMC-Dv2 requires ISMv2 and SMC-Rv2 requires RoCEv2.

The SMCv2 protocol is downward compatible, which allows SMCv2 hosts to continue to communicate with SMCv1 previous hosts.

Although SMCv2 changes the SMC connection protocol to enable multiple IP subnet support, SMCv2 does not change how user TCP socket data is transferred, which preserves the benefits of SMC to TCP workloads.

TCP/IP connections that require IPsec are not eligible for any form of SMC.

HiperSockets Completion Queue

user TCP socket data is transferred, which preserves the benefits of SMC to TCP workloads.

TCP/IP connections that require IPsec are not eligible for any form of SMC.

HiperSockets Completion Queue

The HiperSockets Completion Queue function is implemented on IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14. This function is designed to allow HiperSockets to transfer data synchronously (if possible) and asynchronously, if necessary. Therefore, it combines ultra-low latency with more tolerance for traffic peaks. HiperSockets Completion Queue can be especially helpful in burst situations.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge

The HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge is supported on IBM Z servers. With the HiperSockets Virtual Switch Bridge, z/VM virtual switch is enhanced to transparently bridge a guest virtual machine network connection on a HiperSockets LAN segment. This bridge allows a single HiperSockets guest virtual machine network connection to also directly communicate with the following components:

- /SM590000 Other guest virtual machines on the virtual switch
- /SM590000 External network hosts through the virtual switch OSA UPLINK port

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility

The HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility allows the streaming of bulk data over a HiperSockets link between two LPARs. Multiple output buffers are supported on a single Signal Adapter (SIGA) write instruction. The key advantage of this enhancement is that it allows the receiving LPAR to process a much larger amount of data per I/O interrupt. This process is transparent to the operating system in the receiving partition. HiperSockets Multiple Write Facility with fewer I/O interrupts is designed to reduce processor use of the sending and receiving partitions.

Support for this function is required by the sending operating system. For more information, see 'HiperSockets' on page 185. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

HiperSockets support of IPV6

IPv6 is a key element in the future of networking. The IPv6 support for HiperSockets allows compatible implementations between external networks and internal HiperSockets networks. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

HiperSockets Layer 2 support

For flexible and efficient data transfer for IP and non-IP workloads, the HiperSockets internal networks on IBM Z servers can support two transport modes: Layer 2 (Link Layer) and the current Layer 3 (Network or IP Layer). Traffic can be Internet Protocol (IP) Version 4 or Version 6 (IPv4, IPv6) or non-IP (AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA).



--- Chunk 7597 ---
es: Layer 2 (Link Layer) and the current Layer 3 (Network or IP Layer). Traffic can be Internet Protocol (IP) Version 4 or Version 6 (IPv4, IPv6) or non-IP (AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA).

HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device features its own Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) address. This MAC address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of Layer 2 addresses, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers and firewalls.

Layer 2 support can help facilitate server consolidation. Complexity can be reduced, network configuration is simplified and intuitive, and LAN administrators can configure and maintain the mainframe environment the same way as they do a nonmainframe environment.

HiperSockets network traffic analyzer (HS NTA) provides support for tracing Layer2 and Layer3 HiperSockets network traffic in Linux on IBM Z. This support allows Linux on IBM Z to control the trace for the internal virtual LAN to capture the records into host memory and storage (file systems).

Linux on IBM Z tools can be used to format, edit, and process the trace records for analysis by system programmers and network administrators.

Checksum offload for in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD)

Checksum offload provides the capability of calculating the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and IP header checksum. Checksum verifies the accuracy of files. By moving the checksum calculations to a Gigabit or 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature, host processor cycles are reduced and performance is improved.

Checksum offload provides checksum offload for several types of traffic and is supported by the following features when configured as CHPID type OSD (QDIO mode only):

uns the checksum calculations for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets. The checksum offload function applies to packets that go to or come from the LAN.

When multiple IP stacks share an OSA-Express, and an IP stack sends a packet to a next hop address that is owned by another IP stack that is sharing the OSA-Express, OSA-Express sends the IP packet directly to the other IP stack. The packet does not have to be placed out on the LAN, which is termed LPAR-to-LPAR traffic. Checksum offload is enhanced to support the LPAR-to-LPAR traffic, which was not originally available.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Querying and displaying an OSA configuration

OSA-Express3 introduced the capability for the operating system to query and display directly the current OSA configuration information (similar to OSA/SF). z/OS uses this OSA capability by introducing the TCP/IP operator command display OSAINFO . z/VM provides this function with the NETSTAT OSAINFO TCP/IP command.

The use of display OSAINFO (z/OS) or NETSTAT OSAINFO (z/VM) allows the operator to monitor and verify the current OSA configuration and helps improve the overall management, serviceability, and usability of OSA-Express cards.

These commands apply to CHPID type OSD. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

These commands apply to CHPID type OSD. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

QDIO data connection isolation for z/VM

The QDIO data connection isolation function provides a higher level of security when sharing an OSA connection in z/VM environments that use VSWITCH. The VSWITCH is a virtual network device that provides switching between OSA connections and the connected guest systems.

QDIO data connection isolation allows disabling internal routing for each QDIO connected. It also provides a means for creating security zones and preventing network traffic between the zones.

QDIO data connection isolation is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

QDIO interface isolation for z/OS



--- Chunk 7803 ---
ction isolation is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

QDIO interface isolation for z/OS

Some environments require strict controls for routing data traffic between servers or nodes. In specific cases, the LPAR-to-LPAR capability of a shared OSA connection can prevent such controls from being enforced. With interface isolation, internal routing can be controlled on an LPAR basis. When interface isolation is enabled, the OSA discards any packets that are destined for a z/OS LPAR that is registered in the OSA Address Table (OAT) as isolated.

QDIO interface isolation is supported on all OSA-Express features on IBM z16. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

QDIO optimized latency mode

O interface isolation is supported on all OSA-Express features on IBM z16. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

QDIO optimized latency mode

QDIO optimized latency mode (OLM) can help improve performance for applications that feature a critical requirement to minimize response times for inbound and outbound data.

OLM optimizes the interrupt processing in the following manner:

- /SM590000 For inbound processing, the TCP/IP stack looks more frequently for available data to process. This process ensures that any new data is read from the OSA-Express features without needing more program-controlled interrupts (PCIs).
- /SM590000 For outbound processing, the OSA-Express cards also look more frequently for available data to process from the TCP/IP stack. Therefore, the process does not require a Signal Adapter (SIGA) instruction to determine whether more data is available.



--- Chunk 7805 ---
lso look more frequently for available data to process from the TCP/IP stack. Therefore, the process does not require a Signal Adapter (SIGA) instruction to determine whether more data is available.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization

QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization enables system programmers and network administrators to coordinate and simultaneously capture software and hardware traces. It allows z/OS to signal OSA-Express features (by using a diagnostic assist function) to stop traces and capture the current trace records.

QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization is supported by the OSA-Express features on IBM z16 when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) for OSA

n is supported by the OSA-Express features on IBM z16 when in QDIO mode (CHPID type OSD). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259.

Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) for OSA

Inbound workload queuing (IWQ) creates multiple input queues and allows OSA to differentiate workloads 'off the wire.' It then assigns work to a specific input queue (per device) to z/OS.

Each input queue is a unique type of workload, and has unique service and processing requirements. The IWQ function allows z/OS to preassign the appropriate processing resources for each input queue. This approach allows multiple concurrent z/OS processing threads to process each unique input queue (workload), which avoids traditional resource contention.

IWQ reduces the conventional z/OS processing that is required to identify and separate unique workloads. This advantage results in improved overall system performance and scalability.



--- Chunk 7807 ---
e contention.

IWQ reduces the conventional z/OS processing that is required to identify and separate unique workloads. This advantage results in improved overall system performance and scalability.

A primary objective of IWQ is to provide improved performance for business-critical interactive workloads by reducing contention that is created by other types of workloads. In a heavily mixed workload environment, this 'off the wire' network traffic separation is provided by OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, and OSA-Express6S 11  features that are defined as CHPID type OSD.

The following types of z/OS workloads are identified and assigned to unique input queues:

- Network traffic that is associated with a distributed virtual Internet Protocol address (VIPA) is assigned to a unique input queue. This configuration allows the Sysplex Distributor traffic to be immediately distributed to the target host.
- /SM590000 z/OS bulk data traffic

Network traffic that is dynamically associated with a streaming (bulk data) TCP connection is assigned to a unique input queue. This configuration allows the bulk data processing to be assigned the suitable resources and isolated from critical interactive workloads.

IWQ for the OSA-Express features is enhanced to differentiate and separate inbound Enterprise Extender traffic to a dedicated input queue.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

GARP VLAN Registration Protocol

All OSA-Express features support VLAN prioritization, which is a component of the IEEE 802.1 standard. GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) support allows an OSA-Express port to register or unregister its VLAN IDs with a GVRP-capable switch and dynamically update its table as the VLANs change. This process simplifies the network administration and management of VLANs because manually entering VLAN IDs at the switch is no longer necessary.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Link aggregation support for z/VM

Link aggregation (IEEE 802.3ad) that is controlled by the z/VM Virtual Switch (VSWITCH) allows the dedication of an OSA-Express port to the z/VM operating system. The port must be participating in an aggregated group that is configured in Layer 2 mode.

Link aggregation (trunking) combines multiple physical OSA-Express ports into a single logical link. This configuration increases throughput, and provides nondisruptive failover if a port becomes unavailable. The target links for aggregation must be of the same type.

Link aggregation is applicable to CHPID type OSD (QDIO). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation

Link aggregation is applicable to CHPID type OSD (QDIO). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation

Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation support allows a port group of OSA-Express features to span multiple virtual switches within a single z/VM system or between multiple z/VM systems. Sharing a Link Aggregation Port Group (LAG) with multiple virtual switches increases optimization and use of the OSA-Express features when handling larger traffic loads.

Higher adapter use protects customer investments, which is increasingly important as 10 GbE deployments become more prevalent. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Large send for IPv6 packets

Large send for IPv6 packets improves performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express feature by using a more efficient memory transfer into it.

Large send for IPv6 packets improves performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express feature by using a more efficient memory transfer into it.

Large send support for IPv6 packets applies to the OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, and OSA-Express6S 11  features (CHPID type OSD) on IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14.

OSA-Express6S added TCP checksum on large send, which reduces the cost (CPU time) of error detection for large send.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA Dynamic LAN idle

The OSA Dynamic LAN idle parameter helps reduce latency and improve performance by dynamically adjusting the inbound blocking algorithm. System administrators can authorize the TCP/IP stack to enable a dynamic setting that previously was static.

The blocking algorithm is modified based on the following application requirements:

The blocking algorithm is modified based on the following application requirements:

- /SM590000 For latency-sensitive applications, the blocking algorithm is modified considering latency.
- /SM590000 For streaming (throughput-sensitive) applications, the blocking algorithm is adjusted to maximize throughput.

In all cases, the TCP/IP stack determines the best setting that is based on the current system and environmental conditions, such as inbound workload volume, processor use, and traffic patterns. It can then dynamically update the settings.

Supported OSA-Express features adapt to the changes, which avoids thrashing and frequent updates to the OAT. Based on the TCP/IP settings, OSA holds the packets before presenting them to the host. A dynamic setting is designed to avoid or minimize host interrupts.

OSA Layer 3 virtual MAC for z/OS environments

To help simplify the infrastructure and facilitate load balancing when an LPAR is sharing an OSA MAC address with another LPAR, each operating system instance can have its own unique logical or virtual MAC (VMAC) address. All IP addresses that are associated with a TCP/IP stack are accessible by using their own VMAC address instead of sharing the MAC address of an OSA port. This situation also applies to Layer 3 mode and to an OSA port spanned among channel subsystems.

Network Traffic Analyzer

IBM Z servers offer systems programmers and network administrators the ability to more easily solve network problems despite high traffic. With the OSA-Express Network Traffic Analyzer and QDIO Diagnostic Synchronization on the server, you can capture trace and trap data. This data can then be forwarded to z/OS tools for easier problem determination and resolution.

7.5.5  z/OS V2.R3

IBM announced z/OS Version 2 Release 3 - Engine for digital transformation through Announcement letter 217-246 on 17 July 2017. Focusing on three critical areas (Security, Simplification, and Cloud), z/OS V2.R3 provides a simple and transparent approach to enable extensive encryption of data and to simplify the overall management of the z/OS system to increase productivity. Focus also is given to providing a simple approach for self-service provisioning and rapid delivery of software as a service, while enabling for the API economy.

Consider the following points before migrating z/OS V2.R3 to IBM z16:



--- Chunk 8092 ---
 simple approach for self-service provisioning and rapid delivery of software as a service, while enabling for the API economy.

Consider the following points before migrating z/OS V2.R3 to IBM z16:

- /SM590000 IBM z/OS V2.R3 with IBM z16 requires a minimum of 8 GB of memory. When running as a z/VM guest or on an IBM System zfi Personal Development Tool, a minimum of 2 GB is required for z/OS V2.R3. If the minimum is not met, a warning WTOR is issued at IPL.
- Continuing with less than the minimum memory might affect availability. A migration health check warns if the system is configured with less than 8 GB.
- /SM590000 Dynamic splitting and merging of Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) is available with IBM z16.
- /SM590000 RMF support is provided to collect SMC-D related performance measurements in SMF 73 Channel Path Activity and SMF 74 subtype 9 PCIe Activity records. It also provides these measurements in the RMF Postprocessor and Monitor III PCIe and Channel Activity reports.

asurements in SMF 73 Channel Path Activity and SMF 74 subtype 9 PCIe Activity records. It also provides these measurements in the RMF Postprocessor and Monitor III PCIe and Channel Activity reports.

HyperSwap support is enhanced to allow RESERVE processing. When a system runs a request to swap to secondary devices that are managed by HyperSwap, z/OS detects when RESERVEs are held and ensures that the devices that are swapped also hold the RESERVE. This enhancement is provided with collaboration from z/OS, GDPS HyperSwap, and CSM HyperSwap.

7.5.6  Remote dynamic activation of I/O configurations for stand-alone Coupling Facilities, Linux on Z and z/TPF

The remote activation of dynamic changes avoid the need for disruptive hardware/firmware actions (Power-on Reset or IML) to be taken to instantiate those configuration changes, reducing, or completely eliminating the client workload impact that would otherwise have resulted from taking these disruptive actions.

r IML) to be taken to instantiate those configuration changes, reducing, or completely eliminating the client workload impact that would otherwise have resulted from taking these disruptive actions.

IBM z16 provide a supported capability to drive these hardware-only I/O configuration changes from a driving z/OS HCD instance to a remote target CPC which is a Coupling facility of hosts IBM Linux on Z and z/TPF.

This new support is applicable only when boththe driving CPC and the target CPC are z16s with the required firmware support (Bundle S24 or higher) and when the driving system's z/OS level is 2.3 or higher with APA OA65559.

7.5.7  Coupling links

IBM z16 servers support only active participation in the same Parallel Sysplex with IBM z15 and IBM z14. Configurations with z/OS on one of these servers can add an IBM z16 Server to their Sysplex for a z/OS or a Coupling Facility image.

Configurations with a Coupling Facility on one of these servers can add an IBM z16 Server to their Sysplex for a z/OS or a Coupling Facility image. IBM z16 does not support participating in a Parallel Sysplex with System IBM z13/IBM z13s and earlier systems.

Each system can use, or not use, internal coupling links, CE LR links, or ICA SR coupling links independently of what other systems are using.

Coupling connectivity is available only when other systems also support the same type of coupling. For more information about supported coupling link technologies on IBM z16, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187, and the Coupling Facility Configuration Options white paper.

7.5.8  z/OS XL C/C++ considerations

IBM z/OS V2.R4 XL C/C++ is an optional feature of z/OS that continues to ship with IBM z16.

The following new functions provide performance improvements for applications by using new IBM z16 instructions:

- /SM590000 High-performance math libraries
- /SM590000 MASS
- /SM590000 Replace Atlas with OpenBLAS
- /SM590000 Metal C for modernizing HLASM applications and systems programming

- /SM590000 MASS
- /SM590000 Replace Atlas with OpenBLAS
- /SM590000 Metal C for modernizing HLASM applications and systems programming

To enable the use of new functions, specify ARCH(14) and VECTOR for compilation. The binaries that are produced by the compiler on IBM z16 can be run only on IBM z16 and above because it uses the vector facility on IBM z16 for new functions. The use of older versions of the compiler on IBM z16 does not enable new functions.

z/OS V2R4 can use the latest level (14) of the following C/C++ compiler options:

ty on IBM z16 for new functions. The use of older versions of the compiler on IBM z16 does not enable new functions.

z/OS V2R4 can use the latest level (14) of the following C/C++ compiler options:

- /SM590000 ARCHITECTURE : This option selects the minimum level of system architecture on which the program can run. Specific features that are provided by the compiler require a minimum architecture level. ARCH(14) uses instructions that are available on the IBM z16.
- /SM590000 TUNE : This option allows optimization of the application for a specific system architecture within the constraints that are imposed by the ARCHITECTURE option. The TUNE level must not be lower than the setting in the ARCHITECTURE option.



--- Chunk 8099 ---
f the application for a specific system architecture within the constraints that are imposed by the ARCHITECTURE option. The TUNE level must not be lower than the setting in the ARCHITECTURE option.

Important: Use the previous IBM Z ARCHITECTURE or TUNE options for C/C++ programs if the same applications run on the previous IBM Z servers. However, if C/C++ applications run on IBM z16 servers only, use the latest ARCHITECTURE and TUNE options to ensure that the best performance possible is delivered through the latest instruction set additions.

For more information about the ARCHITECTURE , TUNE , and VECTOR compiler options, see z/OS XL C/C++ User's Guide, SC14-7307-40.

7.7  z/VSE migration considerations

As described in 7.2.3, 'z/VSE' on page 251, IBM z16 supports z/VSE 6.2.

Consider the following general guidelines when you are migrating z/VSE environment to IBM z16 servers:

- /SM590000 Collect reference information before migration

This information includes baseline data that reflects the status of, for example, performance data, CPU use of reference workload, I/O activity, and elapsed times.



--- Chunk 8225 ---
ence information before migration

This information includes baseline data that reflects the status of, for example, performance data, CPU use of reference workload, I/O activity, and elapsed times.

This information is required to size IBM z16 and is the only way to compare workload characteristics after migration.

For more information, see z/VSE Release and Hardware Upgrade .

- /SM590000 Apply required maintenance for IBM z16

Review the Preventive Service Planning (PSP) bucket 8561DEVICE for IBM z16 and apply the required PTFs for IBM and independent software vendor (ISV) products.

Note: IBM z16™ supports z/Architecture mode only.

7.8  Software licensing

/SM590000 zIPLA licensing

International Program License Agreement (IPLA) programs include a one-time charge (OTC) and an optional annual maintenance charge, called Subscription and Support. This annual charge includes access to IBM technical support and enables you to obtain version upgrades at no charge for products that generally fall under the zIPLA such as application development tools, CICS tools, data management tools, WebSphere for IBM Z products, Linux on IBM Z middleware and z/VM.

The following pricing metrics apply to IBM Z IPLA products:



--- Chunk 8230 ---
ch as application development tools, CICS tools, data management tools, WebSphere for IBM Z products, Linux on IBM Z middleware and z/VM.

The following pricing metrics apply to IBM Z IPLA products:

- -Value Unit pricing applies to most IPLA products that run on z/OS. Value Unit pricing is typically based on a number of MSUs and allows for lower cost of incremental growth.
- -z/VM V5, V6, V7, and specific z/VM middleware include pricing that is based on the number of engines. Engine-based Value Unit pricing allows for a lower cost of incremental growth with more engine-based licenses that are purchased.
- -Most Linux middleware also is priced based on the number of engines. The number of engines is converted into Processor Value Units under the IBM Passport Advantagefi terms and conditions.

For more information, see this web page.

- /SM590000 Subcapacity licensing



--- Chunk 8231 ---
s. The number of engines is converted into Processor Value Units under the IBM Passport Advantagefi terms and conditions.

For more information, see this web page.

- /SM590000 Subcapacity licensing

Subcapacity licensing includes software charges for specific IBM products that are based on the use capacity of the logical partitions (LPARs) on which the product runs.

Subcapacity licensing removes the dependency between the software charges and CPC (hardware) installed capacity.

The subcapacity licensed products are charged monthly based on the highest observed 4-hour rolling average use of the logical partitions in which the product runs.



--- Chunk 8232 ---
PC (hardware) installed capacity.

The subcapacity licensed products are charged monthly based on the highest observed 4-hour rolling average use of the logical partitions in which the product runs.

The 4-hour rolling average use of the logical partition can be limited by a defined capacity value on the image profile of the partition. This value activates the soft capping function of PR/SM, which limits the 4-hour rolling average partition use to the defined capacity value. Soft capping controls the maximum 4-hour rolling average usage (the last 4-hour average value at every 5-minute interval), but does not limit the maximum instantaneous partition use.

You can also use an LPAR group capacity limit, which sets soft capping by PR/SM for a group of logical partitions that are running z/OS. Only the 4-hour rolling average use of the LPAR group is tracked, which allows use peaks above the group capacity value.

- /SM590000 Sysplex licensing



--- Chunk 8233 ---
p of logical partitions that are running z/OS. Only the 4-hour rolling average use of the LPAR group is tracked, which allows use peaks above the group capacity value.

- /SM590000 Sysplex licensing

Sysplex licensing allows monthly software licenses to be aggregated across a qualified Parallel Sysplex. To be eligible for Sysplex pricing aggregation, the customer environment must meet hardware, software, operation, and verification criteria to be considered 'actively coupled'. For more information about Sysplex licensing, see this web page.

- /SM590000 Taylor Fit Software Consumption

Taylor Fit Software Consumption Solution is a cloud-like, usage-based licensing model. Usage is measured based on MSUs that are used, which removes the need for manual or automated capping. It also allows customers to configure their systems to support optimal response times and service level agreements.

Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP) requires z/OS V2.R2, or later, with the applicable PTFs applied.



--- Chunk 8234 ---
lows customers to configure their systems to support optimal response times and service level agreements.

Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP) requires z/OS V2.R2, or later, with the applicable PTFs applied.

The requirements for TFP vary with the solution. The specific requirements for a solution must be met before IBM can accept and process subcapacity reports in which TFP solutions are reported. For more information about TFP, see this web page.

Technology Transition Offerings with IBM z16

Complementing the announcement of the IBM z16 server, IBM introduced the following Technology Transition Offerings (TTOs):

- /SM590000 Technology Update Pricing for the IBM z16.
- /SM590000 New and revised Transition Charges for Sysplexes or Multiplexes TTOs for actively coupled Parallel Sysplexes (z/OS), Loosely Coupled Complexes (z/TPF), and Multiplexes (z/OS and z/TPF).



--- Chunk 8235 ---

- /SM590000 New and revised Transition Charges for Sysplexes or Multiplexes TTOs for actively coupled Parallel Sysplexes (z/OS), Loosely Coupled Complexes (z/TPF), and Multiplexes (z/OS and z/TPF).

Technology Update Pricing for the IBM z16 extends the software price and performance that is provided by AWLC for IBM z16 servers. The new and revised Transition Charges for Sysplexes offerings provide a transition to Technology Update Pricing for the IBM z16 for customers who have not fully migrated to IBM z16 servers. This transition ensures that aggregation benefits are maintained and phases in the benefits of Technology Update Pricing for the IBM z16 pricing as customers migrate.

When an IBM z16 server is in an actively coupled Parallel Sysplex or a Loosely Coupled Complex, you might choose aggregated Advanced Workload License Charges (AWLC) pricing or aggregated Parallel Sysplex License Charges (PSLC) pricing (subject to all applicable terms and conditions).



--- Chunk 8236 ---
 Complex, you might choose aggregated Advanced Workload License Charges (AWLC) pricing or aggregated Parallel Sysplex License Charges (PSLC) pricing (subject to all applicable terms and conditions).

When an IBM z16 server is part of a Multiplex under Country Multiplex Pricing (CMP) terms, Country Multiplex License Charges (CMLC), Multiplex zNALC (MzNALC), and Flat Workload License Charges (FWLC) are the only pricing metrics that are available (subject to all applicable terms and conditions).

When an IBM z16 server is running z/VSE, you can choose Mid-Range Workload License Charges (MWLC), which are subject to all applicable terms and conditions.

For more information about AWLC, CMLC, MzNALC, PSLC, MWLC, or the Technology Update Pricing and Transition Charges for Sysplexes or Multiplexes TTO offerings, see the IBM Z Software Pricing page of the IBM IT infrastructure website.

8.2  Permanent and Temporary Upgrades

The terminology for CoD and the types of upgrades for an IBM z16 are described in this section.

8.2.1  Overview

Upgrades can be categorized as described in this section.

Permanent versus temporary upgrades

Deciding whether to perform a permanent or temporary upgrade depends on the situation. For example, a growing workload might require more memory, I/O cards, or processor capacity. However, to handle a peak workload or to temporarily replace a system that is down during a disaster or data center maintenance, might require only a temporary upgrade.

IBM z16 servers offer the following solutions:

 a peak workload or to temporarily replace a system that is down during a disaster or data center maintenance, might require only a temporary upgrade.

IBM z16 servers offer the following solutions:

- /SM590000 Permanent upgrades
- -Miscellaneous equipment specification (MES)
- An MES upgrade might involve adding physical hardware or installing Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC). In both cases, the hardware installation is performed by IBM personnel.
- -Customer Initiated Upgrade (CIU)

The use of the CIU facility for a system requires that the online CoD buying feature (FC 9900) is installed on the system and the relevant CIU contract agreements are in place. The CIU facility supports only LICCC upgrades.

For more information, see 8.2.4, 'Permanent upgrades' on page 332.

) is installed on the system and the relevant CIU contract agreements are in place. The CIU facility supports only LICCC upgrades.

For more information, see 8.2.4, 'Permanent upgrades' on page 332.

Tip: An MES provides system upgrades that can result in more enabled processors, a different central processor (CP) capacity level, more processor drawers, memory, PCIe+ I/O drawers, and I/O features (physical upgrade). Extra planning tasks are required for nondisruptive logical upgrades. An MES is ordered through your IBM representative and installed by IBM service support representatives (IBM SSRs).

- /SM590000 Temporary upgrades

All temporary upgrades are LICCC-based. The one billable capacity offering is On/Off Capacity on Demand (CoD), which can be used for short-term capacity requirements and are pre-paid or post-paid.

The two replacement capacity offerings available are Capacity Backup (CBU) and Capacity for Planned Event (CPE).

hich can be used for short-term capacity requirements and are pre-paid or post-paid.

The two replacement capacity offerings available are Capacity Backup (CBU) and Capacity for Planned Event (CPE).

Note: CPE is available only when carried forward to IBM z16.

System Recovery Boost zIIP capacity is a pre-paid offering that is available on IBM z15 T01 and IBM z16 A01. It is intended to provide temporary zIIP capacity to be used to boost CPU performance for boost events. For more information, see Introducing IBM X System Recovery Boost , REDP-5563.

Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is new type of temporary record that is introduced with IBM z16. This record holds the Flexible Capacity Entitlements for IBM z16 machines across two or more sites.

8.2.3  Concurrent and nondisruptive upgrades

Depending on the effect on the system and application availability, upgrades can be classified in the following manner:

- /SM590000 Concurrent

In general, concurrency addresses the continuity of operations of the hardware during an upgrade; for example, whether a system (hardware) must be turned off during the upgrade. For more information, see 8.3, 'Concurrent upgrades' on page 334.

- /SM590000 Nonconcurrent

This type of upgrade requires turning off the hardware that is being upgraded. Examples include memory upgrades to an IBM z16 A01 max 39.

- /SM590000 Nondisruptive

Nondisruptive upgrades do not require the software or operating system to be restarted for the upgrade to take effect.

- /SM590000 Disruptive



--- Chunk 8247 ---
s to an IBM z16 A01 max 39.

- /SM590000 Nondisruptive

Nondisruptive upgrades do not require the software or operating system to be restarted for the upgrade to take effect.

- /SM590000 Disruptive

An upgrade is considered disruptive when resources that are modified or added to an operating system image require that the operating system be restarted to configure the newly added resources.

A Concurrent upgrade might be disruptive to operating systems or programs that do not support the upgrades while being nondisruptive to others. For more information, see 8.12, 'Planning for nondisruptive upgrades' on page 372.

8.2.4  Permanent upgrades

Permanent upgrades can be obtained by using the following processes:

- /SM590000 Ordered through an IBM marketing representative
- /SM590000 Initiated by the client with the CIU on the IBM Resource Link



--- Chunk 8248 ---
nent upgrades can be obtained by using the following processes:

- /SM590000 Ordered through an IBM marketing representative
- /SM590000 Initiated by the client with the CIU on the IBM Resource Link

Tip: The use of the CIU facility for a system requires that the online CoD buying feature (FC 9900) is installed on the system. The CIU facility is enabled through the permanent upgrade authorization feature code (FC 9898).

Permanent upgrades that are ordered through an IBM representative

Through a permanent upgrade, you can accomplish the following tasks:

- /SM590000 Add:
- -Processor drawers
- -Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) drawers and features
- -Model capacity
- -Specialty engines
- -Memory
- -I/O channels
- -Crypto Express cards
- /SM590000 Activate unassigned model capacity or IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs
- /SM590000 Deactivate activated model capacity or IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs
- /SM590000 Change specialty engines (recharacterization)



--- Chunk 8249 ---
/SM590000 Activate unassigned model capacity or IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs
- /SM590000 Deactivate activated model capacity or IFLs, ICFs, or zIIPs
- /SM590000 Change specialty engines (recharacterization)

Considerations: Most of the MESs can be concurrently applied without disrupting the workload. For more information, see 8.3, 'Concurrent upgrades' on page 334. However, specific MES changes might be disruptive, such as adding PCIe IO drawers.

Memory upgrades that require dual inline memory module (DIMM) changes can be made nondisruptively if multiple CPC drawers are available and the

flexible memory option is used.

- /SM590000 Capacity for Planned Event
- /SM590000 Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency

8.3  Concurrent upgrades

Concurrent upgrades on IBM z16 servers can provide more capacity with no system outage. In most cases, a concurrent upgrade can be nondisruptive to the operating system with planning and operating system support.

This capability is based on the flexibility of the design and structure, which allows concurrent hardware installation and Licensed Internal Control Code (LICC) configuration changes.

This capability is based on the flexibility of the design and structure, which allows concurrent hardware installation and Licensed Internal Control Code (LICC) configuration changes.

The sub-capacity models allow more configuration granularity within the family. The added granularity is available for models that are configured with up to 39 CPs, and provides 117 extra capacity settings. Sub-capacity models provide for CP capacity increase in two dimensions that can be used together to deliver configuration granularity. The first dimension is adding CPs to the configuration. The second is changing the capacity setting of the CPs currently installed to a higher model capacity identifier.

r configuration granularity. The first dimension is adding CPs to the configuration. The second is changing the capacity setting of the CPs currently installed to a higher model capacity identifier.

IBM z16 allows the concurrent and nondisruptive addition of processors to a running logical partition (LPAR). As a result, you can have a flexible infrastructure to which you can add capacity. This function is supported by z/OS, z/VM, and z/VSE. This addition is made by using one of the following methods:

- /SM590000 With planning ahead for the future need of extra processors. Reserved processors can be specified in the LPAR's profile. When the extra processors are installed, the number of active processors for that LPAR can be increased without the need for a partition reactivation and initial program load (IPL).
- /SM590000 Another (easier) way is to enable the dynamic addition of processors through the z/OS LOADxx member. Set the DYNCPADD parameter in member LOADxx to ENABLE .

d initial program load (IPL).
- /SM590000 Another (easier) way is to enable the dynamic addition of processors through the z/OS LOADxx member. Set the DYNCPADD parameter in member LOADxx to ENABLE .

Another function concerns the system assist processor (SAP). When more SAPs are concurrently added to the configuration, the SAP-to-channel affinity is dynamically remapped on all SAPs on the system to rebalance the I/O configuration.

8.3.1  PU Capacity feature upgrades

IBM z16 Model A01 has a machine type 3931 and a model capacity identifier.

The 3931 is available in the following CPC drawer configurations:

- /SM590000 Feature Max39 (one CPC Drawer installed) can have a maximum of 39 PUs for client characterization
- /SM590000 Feature Max82 (two CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 82 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max125 (three CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 125 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max168 (four CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 168 client PUs



--- Chunk 8258 ---
have a maximum of 82 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max125 (three CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 125 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max168 (four CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 168 client PUs

- /SM590000 Feature Max200 (four CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 200 client PUs
- /SM590000 Model capacity identifiers 4 xx , 5 yy , 6 yy , or 7 nn

The xx is a range of 00 - 39 2 , yy is a range of 01 - 39, and nn is a range of 01 - 99, A0 - K0, where A0 represents the decimal number 100, which combines the character A with decimal 0 and where K0 represents the decimal number 200. It is obtained by continuing the hexadecimal counting to the following values:

- -F = 15
- -G = 16
- -H = 17
- -I = 18
- -J = 19
- -K = 20
- -Adding the decimal digit 0 to make 200

An IBM z16 A01 with 200 client usable processors is an IBM z16 7K0. The model capacity identifier describes how many CPs are characterized ( xx , yy , or nn ) and the capacity setting (4, 5, 6, or 7) of the CPs.

1 with 200 client usable processors is an IBM z16 7K0. The model capacity identifier describes how many CPs are characterized ( xx , yy , or nn ) and the capacity setting (4, 5, 6, or 7) of the CPs.

A hardware configuration upgrade always requires more physical hardware (processor drawers, PCIe+ I/O drawers, or both). A system upgrade can change the system model or the MCI.

Consider the following points regarding model upgrades:

- /SM590000 LICCC upgrade:
- -Can add memory or Virtual Flash Memory (VFM) up to the amount that is physically installed
- -Can change the model capacity identifier, the capacity setting, or both
- /SM590000 Hardware installation upgrade:
- -Can change the CPC drawer feature by adding one or more drawers
- -Can change the model capacity identifier, the capacity setting, or both
- -Can add physical memory, PCIe+ I/O drawers, and other hardware features



--- Chunk 8260 ---
CPC drawer feature by adding one or more drawers
- -Can change the model capacity identifier, the capacity setting, or both
- -Can add physical memory, PCIe+ I/O drawers, and other hardware features

The model capacity identifier can be concurrently changed. Concurrent upgrades can be performed for permanent and temporary upgrades.

Tip: A CPC drawer feature upgrade can be performed concurrently only for a Max39 or a Max82 machine if feature codes 2981 or 2982 were ordered with the base machine.

LICCC upgrades (MES ordered)

The LICCC provides for system upgrades without hardware changes by activating extra (physically installed) unused capacity. Concurrent upgrades through LICCC can be performed for the following resources:



--- Chunk 8261 ---
ICCC provides for system upgrades without hardware changes by activating extra (physically installed) unused capacity. Concurrent upgrades through LICCC can be performed for the following resources:

- /SM590000 Processors, such as CPs, ICFs, z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs), IFLs, and SAPs, if unused PUs are available on the installed processor drawers, or if the model capacity identifier for the CPs can be increased.
- /SM590000 Memory, when unused capacity is available on the installed memory cards. The Flexible memory option is available to give you better control over future memory upgrades. For more information, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

Concurrent hardware installation upgrades (MES ordered)

Configuration upgrades can be concurrent when installing the following resources:

- /SM590000 Processor drawers (which contain processors, memory, and fan-outs). Up to two processor drawers can be added concurrently on an IBM z16 A01 Max39 if feature codes 2981 and 2982 were ordered with the initial configuration.
- /SM590000 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-outs.
- /SM590000 I/O cards, when slots are still available on the installed PCIe+ I/O drawers.
- /SM590000 PCIe+ I/O drawers.

The concurrent I/O upgrade capability can be better used if a future target configuration is considered during the initial configuration.

Concurrent PU conversions (MES ordered)

IBM z16 A01 supports concurrent conversion between all PU types, which includes SAPs, to provide flexibility and meet changing business requirements.

ation.

Concurrent PU conversions (MES ordered)

IBM z16 A01 supports concurrent conversion between all PU types, which includes SAPs, to provide flexibility and meet changing business requirements.

Important: The LICCC-based PU conversions require that at least one PU (CP, ICF, or IFL), remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conversion is disruptive. The PU conversion generates a LICCC that can be installed concurrently in two steps:

- 1. Remove the assigned PU from the configuration.
- 2. Activate the newly available PU as the new PU type.

LPARs also might have to free the PUs to be converted. The operating systems must include support to configure processors offline or online so that the PU conversion can be done nondisruptively.

Considerations: Client planning and operator action are required to use concurrent PU conversion. Consider the following points about PU conversion:



--- Chunk 8264 ---
t the PU conversion can be done nondisruptively.

Considerations: Client planning and operator action are required to use concurrent PU conversion. Consider the following points about PU conversion:

- /SM590000 It is disruptive if all current PUs are converted to different types.
- /SM590000 It might require individual LPAR outages if dedicated PUs are converted.

Unassigned CP capacity is recorded by a model capacity identifier. CP feature conversions change (increase or decrease) the model capacity identifier.

8.3.2  Customer Initiated Upgrade facility

The CIU facility is an IBM online system through which you can order, download, and install permanent and temporary upgrades for IBM Z servers. Access to and use of the CIU facility requires a contract between the client and IBM through for which the terms and conditions for use of the CIU facility are accepted.



--- Chunk 8265 ---
 upgrades for IBM Z servers. Access to and use of the CIU facility requires a contract between the client and IBM through for which the terms and conditions for use of the CIU facility are accepted.

The CIU facility is controlled through the permanent upgrade authorization FC 9898. A prerequisite to FC 9898 is the online CoD buying feature code (FC 9900). Although FC 9898 can be installed on your IBM z16 servers at any time, often it is added when ordering an IBM z16.

After you place an order through the CIU facility, you receive a notice that the order is ready for download. You can then download and apply the upgrade by using functions that are available through the Hardware Management Console (HMC), along with the RSF. After all of the prerequisites are met, the entire process (from ordering to activation of the upgrade) is performed by the customer, and does not require any onsite presence of IBM SSRs.

CIU prerequisites



--- Chunk 8266 ---
l of the prerequisites are met, the entire process (from ordering to activation of the upgrade) is performed by the customer, and does not require any onsite presence of IBM SSRs.

CIU prerequisites

The CIU facility supports LICCC upgrades only. It does not support I/O upgrades. All other capacity that is required for an upgrade must be previously installed. Extra processor drawers or I/O cards cannot be installed as part of an order that is placed through the CIU facility. The sum of CPs, unassigned CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and unassigned IFLs cannot exceed the client PU count of the installed processor drawers. The total number of zIIPs can be twice the number of purchased CPs.

CIU registration and contract for CIU

To use the CIU facility, a customer must be registered and the system must be set up. After you complete the CIU registration, access to the CIU application is available through the IBM Resource Link website.



--- Chunk 8267 ---

As part of the setup, provide one resource link ID for configuring and placing CIU orders and, if required, a second ID as an approver. The IDs are then set up for access to the CIU support. The CIU facility allows upgrades to be ordered and delivered much faster than through the regular MES process.

To order and activate the upgrade, log on to the IBM Resource Link website, and start the CIU application to upgrade a system for processors or memory. You can request a client order approval to conform to your operational policies. You also can allow the definition of more IDs to be authorized to access the CIU. More IDs can be authorized to enter or approve CIU orders, or only view orders.

Permanent upgrades

Permanent upgrades can be ordered by using the CIU facility. Through the CIU facility, you can generate online permanent upgrade orders to concurrently add processors (CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs) and memory, or change the model capacity identifier. You can do so up to the limits of the installed processor drawers on a system.

Temporary upgrades

Temporary upgrades

The IBM z16 A01 base model describes permanent and dormant capacity by using the capacity marker and the number of PU features that are installed on the system. Up to eight temporary offerings can be present. Each offering includes its own policies and controls, and each can be activated or deactivated independently in any sequence and combination. Although multiple offerings can be active at any time, only one On/Off CoD offering can be active at any time if enough resources are available to fulfill the offering specifications.

Temporary upgrades are represented in the system by a record . All temporary upgrade records are on the SE hard disk drive (HDD). The records can be downloaded from the RSF or installed from portable media. At the time of activation, you can control everything locally.

The provisioning architecture is shown in Figure 8-1.

e control over the temporary offerings. The activation and deactivation can be driven manually or under the control of an application through a documented application programming interface (API) 3 .

By using the API approach, you can customize at activation time the resources that are necessary to respond to the current situation up to the maximum that is specified in the order record. If the situation changes, you can add or remove resources without having to return to the base configuration. This process eliminates the need for temporary upgrade specifications for all possible scenarios.

For a CPE record, only the ordered configuration can be activated.

This approach also enables you to update and replenish temporary upgrades, even in situations where the upgrades are active. Likewise, depending on the configuration, permanent upgrades can be performed while temporary upgrades are active. Examples of the activation sequence of multiple temporary upgrades are shown in Figure 8-2.

As shown in Figure 8-2, if R2, R3, and R1 are active at the same time, only parts of R1 can be activated because not enough resources are available to fulfill all of R1. When R2 is deactivated, the remaining parts of R1 can be activated as shown.

Temporary capacity can be billable as On/Off CoD, or replacement capacity as CBU, CPE, or System Recovery Boost. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 On/Off CoD is a function that enables concurrent and temporary capacity growth of the system.

On/Off CoD can be used for client peak workload requirements, for any length of time, and includes a daily hardware and maintenance charge. The software charges can vary according to the license agreement for the individual products. For more information, contact your IBM Software Group representative.

On/Off CoD can concurrently add processors (CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs), increase the model capacity identifier, or both. It can do so up to the limit of the installed processor drawers of a system. It is restricted to twice the installed capacity. On/Off CoD requires a contractual agreement between you and IBM.

You decide whether to pre-pay or post-pay On/Off CoD. Capacity tokens that are inside the records are used to control activation time and resources.

- /SM590000 CBU is a concurrent and temporary activation of more CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs; or an increase of the model capacity identifier; or both.

Note: CBU cannot be used for peak workload management in any form.

On/Off CoD is the correct method to use for workload management. A CBU activation can last up to 90 days when a disaster or recovery situation occurs.

CBU features are optional, and require unused capacity to be available on installed processor drawers of the backup system. They can be available as unused PUs, an increase in the model capacity identifier, or both.

A CBU contract must be in place before the special code that enables this capability can be loaded on the system. The standard CBU contract provides for five 10-day tests (the CBU test activation ) and one 90-day activation over a five-year period. For more information, contact your IBM representative.

You can run production workload on a CBU upgrade during a CBU test. At least an equivalent amount of production capacity must be shut down during the CBU test. If you signed CBU contracts, you also must sign an Amendment (US form #Z125-8145) with IBM to allow you to run production workload on a CBU upgrade during your CBU tests.

The CPE offering is used to replace temporary lost capacity within a client's enterprise for planned downtime events, such as data center changes.

Notes: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 CPE cannot be used for peak load management of client workload or for a disaster situation.
- /SM590000 CPE is available only as carry forward on IBM z16.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade record offering can be used to provide extra zIIP capacity that can be used by the System Recovery Boost facility. You might want to consider the use of this offering if your server is a full capacity model (7nn) and can benefit from more CP capacity (running on zIIPs) for system shutdown and restart. The capacity is delivered as zIIPs that can perform CP work during the boost periods for an LPAR.

8.4  Miscellaneous equipment specification upgrades

MES upgrades enable concurrent and permanent capacity growth. MES upgrades allow the concurrent adding of processors (CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs), memory capacity, and I/O ports. For sub-capacity models, MES upgrades allow the concurrent adjustment of the number of processors and the capacity level.

8.4.1  MES upgrade for processors

An MES upgrade for processors can concurrently add CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs to an IBM z16 by assigning available PUs on the processor drawers through LICCC. Depending on the quantity of the extra processors in the upgrade, more processor drawers might be required, and can be concurrently installed before the LICCC is enabled if plan-ahead features are available. With the sub-capacity models, capacity can be provided by adding CPs, changing the capacity identifier on the current CPs, or both.

Limits: The sum of CPs, inactive CPs, ICFs, unassigned ICFs, zIIPs, unassigned zIIPs, IFLs, unassigned IFLs, and SAPs cannot exceed the maximum limit of PUs available for client use. The number of zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs.



--- Chunk 8403 ---
d ICFs, zIIPs, unassigned zIIPs, IFLs, unassigned IFLs, and SAPs cannot exceed the maximum limit of PUs available for client use. The number of zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of purchased CPs.

An example of an MES upgrade for processors (with two upgrade steps) is shown in Figure 8-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

An IBM z16 model A01 Max39 (one processor drawer), model capacity identifier 708 (eight CPs), is concurrently upgraded to a model A01 Max82 (two processor drawers), with MCI 742 (42 CPs). The model upgrade requires adding a processor drawer and assigning and activating 42 PUs as CPs. Then, model Max82, MCI 742, is concurrently upgraded to a capacity identifier 743 (43 CPs) with two IFLs. This process is done by assigning and activating three more unassigned PUs (one as CP and two as IFLs). If needed, LPARs can be created concurrently to use the newly added processors.

with two IFLs. This process is done by assigning and activating three more unassigned PUs (one as CP and two as IFLs). If needed, LPARs can be created concurrently to use the newly added processors.

The example that is shown in Figure 8-3 shows how the addition of PUs as CPs and IFLs and the addition of a processor drawer works. The addition of a processor drawer to an IBM z16 Max 39 upgrades the machine to Max82.

After the second CPC drawer addition, CPC drawer 0 has 39 configurable PUs and CPC drawer 1 has 43 configurable PUs, which allows 82 PUs to be characterized on the new Max82 configuration.

Consideration: All available processors on a server (including reserved processors) can be defined to an LPAR. However, do not define more processors to an LPAR than the target operating system supports.

The number of processors that are supported by various operating systems releases are listed in Table 8-3.

With suitable planning, memory can be added nondisruptively to z/OS partitions and z/VM partitions. If necessary, new LPARs can be created nondisruptively to use the newly added memory.

Concurrency: Upgrades that require DIMM changes can be concurrent by using the EDA feature. Planning is required to see whether this option is a viable for your configuration. The use of the flexible memory option ensures that EDA can work with the least disruption.

The one-processor drawer feature Max39 requires a minimum of 1024 GB addressable memory. The client addressable storage in this case is 512 GB. Memory can be upgraded up to 10 TB of memory (9984 GB client addressable). An upgrade changes the DIMM sizes and adding DIMMs in all available slots in the processor drawer.

You also can add memory by concurrently adding a second processor drawer with sufficient memory into the configuration and then, using LICCC to enable that memory. Changing DIMMs in a single CPC drawer system is disruptive.

An LPAR can dynamically take advantage of a memory upgrade if reserved storage is defined to that LPAR. The reserved storage is defined to the LPAR as part of the image profile.

Reserved memory can be configured online to the LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (DSR) function. DSR allows a z/OS operating system image and z/VM partitions to add reserved storage to their configuration if any unused storage exists.

ing the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (DSR) function. DSR allows a z/OS operating system image and z/VM partitions to add reserved storage to their configuration if any unused storage exists.

The nondisruptive addition of storage to a z/OS and z/VM partition requires the correct operating system parameters to be set. If reserved storage is not defined to the LPAR, the LPAR must be deactivated, the image profile changed, and the LPAR reactivated. This process allows the extra storage resources to be available to the operating system image.

8.4.3  MES upgrades for I/O

MES upgrades for I/O can concurrently add I/O features by using one of the following methods:

- /SM590000 Installing I/O features on an installed PCIe+ I/O drawer
- /SM590000 Adding a PCIe+ I/O drawer to hold the new I/O features

For more information about PCIe+ I/O drawers, see 4.2, 'I/O system overview' on page 148.

For more information about PCIe+ I/O drawers, see 4.2, 'I/O system overview' on page 148.

The number of PCIe+ I/O drawers that can be present in an IBM z16 depends on how many CPC drawers are present and whether the configuration includes the Bulk Power Assembly (BPA) offering. It also depends on whether the CPC drawer reserve features are present.

The number of drawers for a PDU-based IBM z16 configuration options is listed in Table 8-4. Options for a BPA-based IBM z16 are Table 8-5 on page 346. Both tables are based on no CPC drawer reserve options being configured.

Note: The maximum number of I/O drawers in the table is reduced by one for each CPC drawer reserve feature that is present.

To better use the MES for I/O capability, carefully plan the initial configuration to allow concurrent upgrades up to the target configuration.

If a PCIe+ I/O drawer is added to an IBM z16 and original features must be physically moved to another PCIe+ I/O drawer, original card moves are disruptive.

z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on Z do not provide dynamic I/O configuration support. Although installing the new hardware is done concurrently, defining the new hardware to these operating systems requires an IPL.

8.4.5  Summary of plan-ahead feature

The flexible memory plan-ahead feature is available for IBM z16 servers. No feature code is associated with flexible memory. The purpose of flexible memory is to enable enhanced processor drawer availability. If a processor drawer must be serviced, the flexible memory is activated to accommodate storing the CPC drawer that is taken offline. After the repair action, the memory is taken offline again and is made unavailable for use.

Tip: Accurate planning and the definition of the target configuration allows you to maximize the value of these plan-ahead features.

8.5  Permanent upgrade by using the CIU facility

By using the CIU facility (through the IBM Resource Link), you can start a permanent upgrade for CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, SAPs, or memory. When performed through the CIU facility, you add the resources without IBM personnel present at your location. You can also unassign previously purchased CPs and IFL processors through the CIU facility.

Adding permanent upgrades to a system through the CIU facility requires that the permanent upgrade enablement feature (FC 9898) is installed on the system. A permanent upgrade might change the system model capacity identifier (4 xx , 5 yy , 6 yy , or 7 nn ) if more CPs are requested, or if the capacity identifier is changed as part of the permanent upgrade. If necessary, more LPARs can be created concurrently to use the newly added processors.

r 7 nn ) if more CPs are requested, or if the capacity identifier is changed as part of the permanent upgrade. If necessary, more LPARs can be created concurrently to use the newly added processors.

Consideration: A permanent upgrade of processors can provide a concurrent upgrade, which results in more enabled processors that are available to a system configuration. More planning and tasks are required for nondisruptive logical upgrades. For more information, see 'Guidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades' on page 377.

Maintenance charges are automatically adjusted as a result of a permanent upgrade.

Software charges that are based on the total capacity of the system on which the software is installed are adjusted to the new capacity after the permanent upgrade is installed. Software products that use WLC or customers with TFP might not be affected by the system upgrade because their charges are based on LPAR usage rather than system total capacity.

8.6  On/Off Capacity on Demand

On/Off CoD allows you to temporarily enable PUs and unassigned IFLs that are available within the current hardware model. You can also use it to change capacity settings for CPs to help meet your peak workload requirements.

8.6.1  Overview

The capacity for CPs is expressed in millions of service units (MSUs). Capacity for specialty engines is expressed in number of specialty engines. Capacity tokens are used to limit the resource consumption for all types of processor capacity.

Capacity tokens were introduced to provide better control over resource consumption when On/Off CoD offerings are activated. Tokens represent the following resource consumptions:



--- Chunk 8449 ---
rocessor capacity.

Capacity tokens were introduced to provide better control over resource consumption when On/Off CoD offerings are activated. Tokens represent the following resource consumptions:

- /SM590000 For CP capacity, each token represents the amount of CP capacity that results in one MSU of software cost for one day (an MSU-day token ).
- /SM590000 For specialty engines, each token is equivalent to one specialty engine capacity for one day (an engine-day token ).

Each specialty engine type features its own tokens, and each On/Off CoD record includes separate token pools for each capacity type. During the ordering sessions on IBM Resource Link, select how many tokens of each type to create for an offering record. Each engine type must include tokens for that engine type to be activated. Capacity that has no tokens cannot be activated.



--- Chunk 8450 ---
ink, select how many tokens of each type to create for an offering record. Each engine type must include tokens for that engine type to be activated. Capacity that has no tokens cannot be activated.

When resources from an On/Off CoD offering record that contains capacity tokens are activated, a billing window is started. A billing window is always 24 hours. Billing occurs at the end of each billing window.

The resources that are billed are the highest resource use inside each billing window for each capacity type. An activation period is one or more complete billing windows. The activation period is the time from the first activation of resources in a record until the end of the billing window in which the last resource in a record is deactivated.



--- Chunk 8451 ---
plete billing windows. The activation period is the time from the first activation of resources in a record until the end of the billing window in which the last resource in a record is deactivated.

At the end of each billing window, the tokens are decremented by the highest usage of each resource during the billing window. If any resource in a record does not have enough tokens to cover usage for the next billing window, the entire record is deactivated.

Note: On/Off CoD requires that the Online CoD Buying feature (FC 9900) is installed on the system that you want to upgrade.

The On/Off CoD to Permanent Upgrade Option gives customers a window of opportunity to assess capacity additions to your permanent configurations by using On/Off CoD. If a purchase is made, the hardware On/Off CoD charges during this window (three days or less) are waived. If no purchase is made, you are charged for the temporary use.

The following resources are eligible for temporary use:



--- Chunk 8452 ---
ardware On/Off CoD charges during this window (three days or less) are waived. If no purchase is made, you are charged for the temporary use.

The following resources are eligible for temporary use:

- /SM590000 ICFs
- /SM590000 zIIPs
- /SM590000 IFLs
- /SM590000 SAPs

The temporary addition of memory and I/O ports or adapters is not supported.

Unassigned PUs that are on the installed processor drawers can be temporarily and concurrently activated as CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs through LICCC. You can assign PUs up to twice the currently installed CP capacity, and up to twice the number of ICFs, zIIPs, or IFLs.

An On/Off CoD upgrade cannot change the system capacity feature. The addition of processor drawers is not supported. However, the activation of an On/Off CoD upgrade can increase the model capacity identifier (4 xx , 5 yy , 6 yy , or 7 nn ).

- /SM590000 TCP/IP connectivity to observed systems
- /SM590000 RMF Distributed Data Server is active
- /SM590000 CIM server is active

The Capacity Provisioning Manager Console is provided as part of z/OSMF, which provides a browser-based interface for managing z/OS systems.

Customizing the capacity provisioning function is required on the following systems:

- /SM590000 Observed z/OS systems

These systems are in one or multiple sysplexes that are to be monitored. For more information about the capacity provisioning domain, see 8.12, 'Planning for nondisruptive upgrades' on page 372.

8.6.3  Ordering

Concurrently installing temporary capacity by ordering On/Off CoD is possible in the following manner:

- /SM590000 CP features equal to the MSU capacity of installed CPs
- /SM590000 IFL features up to the number of installed IFLs
- /SM590000 ICF features up to the number of installed ICFs
- /SM590000 zIIP features up to the number of installed zIIPs
- /SM590000 SAPs: Up to eight

On/Off CoD can provide CP temporary capacity in two ways:

- /SM590000 By increasing the number of CPs.
- /SM590000 For sub-capacity models, capacity can be added by increasing the number of CPs, changing the sub-capacity setting of the CPs, or both. If the On/Off CoD is adding CP resources that have a capacity setting different from the installed CPs, the base capacity settings are changed to match.

On/Off CoD includes the following limits that are associated with its use:



--- Chunk 8456 ---
 resources that have a capacity setting different from the installed CPs, the base capacity settings are changed to match.

On/Off CoD includes the following limits that are associated with its use:

- -The number of CPs cannot be reduced.
- -The target configuration capacity is limited to these amounts:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Twice the currently installed capacity, expressed in MSUs for CPs.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Twice the number of installed IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs. Up to eight SAPs can be activated. For more information, see 8.3.1, 'PU Capacity feature upgrades' on page 334.

On/Off CoD can be ordered as prepaid or postpaid. A prepaid On/Off CoD offering record contains resource descriptions, MSUs, specialty engines, and tokens that describe the total capacity that can be used. For CP capacity, the token contains MSU-days. For specialty engines, the token contains specialty engine-days.



--- Chunk 8457 ---
 MSUs, specialty engines, and tokens that describe the total capacity that can be used. For CP capacity, the token contains MSU-days. For specialty engines, the token contains specialty engine-days.

When resources on a prepaid offering are activated, they must have enough capacity tokens to allow the activation for an entire billing window, which is 24 hours. The resources remain active until you deactivate them or until one resource uses all of its capacity tokens. Then, all activated resources from the record are deactivated.

A postpaid On/Off CoD offering record contains resource descriptions, MSUs, specialty engines, and can contain capacity tokens that denote MSU-days and specialty engine-days.

When resources in a postpaid offering record without capacity tokens are activated, those resources remain active until they are deactivated, or until the offering record expires. The record normally expires 180 days after its installation.



--- Chunk 8458 ---
rd without capacity tokens are activated, those resources remain active until they are deactivated, or until the offering record expires. The record normally expires 180 days after its installation.

When resources in a postpaid offering record with capacity tokens are activated, those resources must include enough capacity tokens to allow the activation for an entire billing window (24 hours). The resources remain active until they are deactivated until all of the resource tokens are used, or until the record expires. The record usually expires 180 days after its installation. If one capacity token type is used, resources from the entire record are deactivated.

For example, for an IBM z16 with capacity identifier 502 (two CPs), a capacity upgrade through On/Off CoD can be delivered in the following ways:

, resources from the entire record are deactivated.

For example, for an IBM z16 with capacity identifier 502 (two CPs), a capacity upgrade through On/Off CoD can be delivered in the following ways:

- /SM590000 Add CPs of the same capacity setting. With this option, the model capacity identifier can be changed to a 503, which adds another CP to make it a three-way CP. It also can be changed to a 504, which adds two CPs and makes it a four-way CP.
- /SM590000 Change to a different capacity level of the current CPs and change the model capacity identifier to a 602 or 702. The capacity level of the CPs is increased, but no other CPs are added. The 502 also can be temporarily upgraded to a 603, which increases the capacity level and adds a processor. The capacity setting 439 does not have an upgrade path through On/Off CoD because you cannot reduce the number of CPs and a 539 is more than twice the capacity.

Use the Large System Performance Reference (LSPR) information to evaluate the capacity requirements according to your workload type. For more information about LSPR data for current IBM processors, see this web page.

The On/Off CoD hardware capacity is charged on a 24-hour basis. A grace period is granted at the end of the On/Off CoD day. This grace period allows up to an hour after the 24-hour billing period to change the On/Off CoD configuration for the next 24-hour billing period or deactivate the current On/Off CoD configuration. The times when the capacity is activated and deactivated are maintained in the IBM z16 and returned to the IBM support systems.

If On/Off capacity is active, On/Off capacity can be added without having to return the system to its original capacity. If the capacity is increased multiple times within a 24-hour period, the charges apply to the highest amount of capacity active in that period.

If capacity is added from an active record that contains capacity tokens, the system checks whether the resource has enough capacity to be active for an entire billing window (24 hours). If that criteria is not met, no extra resources are activated from the record.

If necessary, more LPARs can be activated concurrently to use the newly added processor resources.

Consideration: On/Off CoD provides a concurrent hardware upgrade that results in more capacity being made available to a system configuration. Extra planning tasks are required for nondisruptive upgrades. For more information, see 'Guidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades' on page 377.

To participate in this offering, you must accept contractual terms for purchasing capacity through the Resource Link, establish a profile, and install an On/Off CoD enablement feature on the system. Later, you can concurrently install temporary capacity up to the limits in On/Off CoD and use it for up to 180 days.

 establish a profile, and install an On/Off CoD enablement feature on the system. Later, you can concurrently install temporary capacity up to the limits in On/Off CoD and use it for up to 180 days.

Monitoring occurs through the system call-home facility. An invoice is generated if the capacity is enabled during the calendar month. You are billed for the use of temporary capacity until the system is returned to the original configuration. Remove the enablement code if the On/Off CoD support is no longer needed.

On/Off CoD orders can be pre-staged in Resource Link to allow multiple optional configurations. The pricing of the orders is done at the time that you order them, and the pricing can vary from quarter to quarter. Staged orders can have different pricing.

allow multiple optional configurations. The pricing of the orders is done at the time that you order them, and the pricing can vary from quarter to quarter. Staged orders can have different pricing.

When the order is downloaded and activated, the daily costs are based on the pricing at the time of the order. The staged orders do not have to be installed in the order sequence. If a staged order is installed out of sequence and later a higher-priced order is staged, the daily cost is based on the lower price.

Another possibility is to store multiple On/Off CoD LICCC records on the SE with the same or different capacities, which gives you greater flexibility to enable quickly needed temporary capacity. Each record is easily identified with descriptive names, and you can select from a list of records that can be activated.

Resource Link provides the interface to order a dynamic upgrade for a specific system. You can create, cancel, and view the order. Configuration rules are enforced, and only valid configurations are generated based on the configuration of the individual system. After you complete the prerequisites, orders for the On/Off CoD can be placed. The order process uses the CIU facility on Resource Link.

Memory and channels are not supported on On/Off CoD.

An individual record can be activated only once. Subsequent sessions require a new order to be generated, which produces a new LICCC record for that specific order.

8.6.4  On/Off CoD testing

Each On/Off CoD-enabled system is entitled to one no-charge 24-hour test. No IBM charges are assessed for the test, including charges that are associated with temporary hardware capacity, IBM software, and IBM maintenance. The test can be used to validate the processes to download, stage, install, activate, and deactivate On/Off CoD capacity.



--- Chunk 8467 ---
ociated with temporary hardware capacity, IBM software, and IBM maintenance. The test can be used to validate the processes to download, stage, install, activate, and deactivate On/Off CoD capacity.

This test can have a maximum duration of 24 hours, which commences upon the activation of any capacity resource that is contained in the On/Off CoD record. Activation levels of capacity can change during the 24-hour test period. The On/Off CoD test automatically stops at the end of the 24-hour period.

You also can perform administrative testing. Although capacity is not added to the system, you can test all of the procedures and automation for the management of the On/Off CoD facility.

An example of an On/Off CoD order on the Resource Link web page is shown in Figure 8-11.

The example order that is shown in Figure 8-11 is an On/Off CoD order for 0% more CP capacity (system is at capacity level 7), and for two more ICFs and two more zIIPs. The maximum number of CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, and IFLs is limited by the current number of available unused PUs of the installed processor drawers. The maximum number of SAPs is determined by the model number and the number of available PUs on the already installed processor drawers.

To finalize the order, you must accept Terms and Conditions for the order, as shown in Figure 8-12.

8.6.5  Activation and deactivation

When a previously ordered On/Off CoD is retrieved from Resource Link, it is downloaded and stored on the SE HDD. You can activate the order manually or through automation when the capacity is needed.

If the On/Off CoD offering record does not contain resource tokens, you must deactivate the temporary capacity manually. Deactivation is done from the SE and is nondisruptive. Depending on how the capacity was added to the LPARs, you might be required to perform tasks at the LPAR level to remove it. For example, you might have to configure offline any CPs that were added to the partition, deactivate LPARs that were created to use the temporary capacity, or both.



--- Chunk 8470 ---
 at the LPAR level to remove it. For example, you might have to configure offline any CPs that were added to the partition, deactivate LPARs that were created to use the temporary capacity, or both.

On/Off CoD orders can be staged in Resource Link so that multiple orders are available. An order can be downloaded and activated only once. If a different On/Off CoD order is required or a permanent upgrade is needed, it can be downloaded and activated without having to restore the system to its original purchased capacity.

In support of automation, an API is available that allows the activation of the On/Off CoD records. The activation is performed from the HMC and requires specifying the order number. With this API, automation code can be used to send an activation command along with the order number to the HMC to enable the order.

8.6.6  Termination

A customer is contractually obligated to end the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature when a transfer in asset ownership occurs. A customer also can choose to end the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature without transferring ownership.

Removing FC 9898 ends the right to use the On/Off CoD. This feature cannot be ordered if a temporary session is active. Similarly, the CIU enablement feature cannot be removed if a temporary session is active. When the CIU enablement feature is removed, the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature is simultaneously removed. Reactivating the right-to-use feature subjects the client to the terms and fees that apply then.

Upgrades that involve physical hardware are supported while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active on a specific IBM z16 server. LICCC-only upgrades can be ordered and retrieved from IBM Resource Link, and can be applied while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active. LICCC-only memory upgrades can be retrieved and applied while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active.

Monitoring

When you activate an On/Off CoD upgrade, an indicator is set in vital product data. This indicator is part of the call-home data transmission, which is sent on a scheduled basis. A timestamp is placed into the call-home data when the facility is deactivated. At the end of each calendar month, the data is used to generate an invoice for the On/Off CoD that was used during that month.

Software

Software Parallel Sysplex license charge (PSLC) clients are billed at the MSU level that is represented by the combined permanent and temporary capacity. All PSLC products are billed at the peak MSUs that are enabled during the month, regardless of usage. Customers with WLC licenses are billed by product at the highest four-hour rolling average for the month. In this instance, temporary capacity does not increase the software bill until that capacity is allocated to LPARs and used.

8.7  z/OS Capacity Provisioning

This section describes how z/OS Capacity Provisioning can help you manage the addition of capacity to a server to handle workload peaks.

z/OS Capacity Provisioning is delivered as part of the z/OS MVS Base Control Program (BCP).

Capacity Provisioning includes the following components:

- /SM590000 Capacity Provisioning Manager (Provisioning Manager)
- /SM590000 Capacity Provisioning Management Console (available in the IBM z/OS Management Facility)
- /SM590000 Sample data sets and files

The Provisioning Manager monitors the workload on a set of z/OS systems and organizes the provisioning of extra capacity to these systems when required. You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file.



--- Chunk 8476 ---
 monitors the workload on a set of z/OS systems and organizes the provisioning of extra capacity to these systems when required. You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file.

The details of extra capacity and the rules for its provisioning are stored in a policy file. These two files are created and maintained through the Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC).

The operational flow of Capacity Provisioning is shown in Figure 8-13 on page 360.

<!-- missing-text -->

The z/OS WLM manages the workload by goals and business importance on each z/OS system. WLM metrics are available through existing interfaces, and are reported through IBM Resource Measurement Facility (RMF) Monitor III, with one RMF gatherer for each z/OS system.

Sysplex-wide data aggregation and propagation occur in the RMF Distributed Data Server (DDS). The RMF Common Information Model (CIM) providers and associated CIM models publish the RMF Monitor III data.



--- Chunk 8477 ---
lex-wide data aggregation and propagation occur in the RMF Distributed Data Server (DDS). The RMF Common Information Model (CIM) providers and associated CIM models publish the RMF Monitor III data.

CPM retrieves critical metrics from one or more z/OS systems' CIM structures and protocols. CPM communicates to local and remote SEs and HMCs by using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

CPM can see the resources in the individual offering records and the capacity tokens. When CPM activates resources, a check is run to determine whether enough capacity tokens remain for the specified resource to be activated for at least 24 hours. If insufficient tokens remain, no resource from the On/Off CoD record is activated.



--- Chunk 8478 ---
 determine whether enough capacity tokens remain for the specified resource to be activated for at least 24 hours. If insufficient tokens remain, no resource from the On/Off CoD record is activated.

If a capacity token is used during an activation that is driven by the CPM, the corresponding On/Off CoD record is deactivated prematurely by the system. This process occurs even if the CPM activates this record, or parts of it. However, you receive warning messages five days before a capacity token is fully used.

The five days are based on the assumption that the consumption is constant for the five days. You must put operational procedures in place to handle these situations. You can deactivate the record manually, allow it to occur automatically, or replenish the specified capacity token by using the Resource Link application.

The Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC) is a console that administrators use to work with provisioning policies and domain configurations and to monitor the status of a Provisioning Manager. The management console is implemented by the Capacity Provisioning task in the IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF). z/OSMF provides a framework for managing various aspects of a z/OS system through a web browser interface.

Capacity Provisioning Domain

The provisioning infrastructure is managed by the CPM through the Capacity Provisioning Domain (CPD), which is controlled by the Capacity Provisioning Policy (CPP). The CPD is shown in Figure 8-14.

--- Chunk 8480 ---
structure is managed by the CPM through the Capacity Provisioning Domain (CPD), which is controlled by the Capacity Provisioning Policy (CPP). The CPD is shown in Figure 8-14.

<!-- missing-text -->

The CPD configuration defines the CPCs and z/OS systems that are controlled by an instance of the CPM. One or more CPCs, sysplexes, and z/OS systems can be defined into a domain. Although sysplexes and CPCs do not have to be contained in a domain, they must not belong to more than one domain.

Each domain has one active capacity provisioning policy.

CPM operates in the following modes, which allows four different levels of automation:

- /SM590000 Manual

Use this command-driven mode when no CPM policy is active.

- /SM590000 Analysis

In analysis mode, CPM processes capacity-provisioning policies and informs the operator when a provisioning or deprovisioning action is required according to policy criteria.



--- Chunk 8481 ---


- /SM590000 Analysis

In analysis mode, CPM processes capacity-provisioning policies and informs the operator when a provisioning or deprovisioning action is required according to policy criteria.

Also, the operator determines whether to ignore the information or to manually upgrade or downgrade the system by using the HMC, SE, or available CPM commands.

- /SM590000 Confirmation

In this mode, CPM processes capacity provisioning policies and interrogates the installed temporary offering records. Every action that is proposed by the CPM must be confirmed by the operator.

- /SM590000 Autonomic

This mode is similar to the confirmation mode, but no operator confirmation is required.

Several reports are available in all modes that contain information about the workload, provisioning status, and the rationale for provisioning guidelines. User interfaces are provided through the z/OS console and the CPMC application.

Planning considerations for using automatic provisioning

Although only one On/Off CoD offering can be active at any one time, several On/Off CoD offerings can be present on the system. Changing from one offering to another requires stopping the active offering before the inactive one can be activated. This operation decreases the current capacity during the change.



--- Chunk 8685 ---
 on the system. Changing from one offering to another requires stopping the active offering before the inactive one can be activated. This operation decreases the current capacity during the change.

The provisioning management routines can interrogate the installed offerings, their content, and the status of the content of the offering. To avoid the decrease in capacity, create only one On/Off CoD offering on the system by specifying the maximum allowable capacity. Then, when an activation is needed, the CPM can activate a subset of the contents of the offering sufficient to satisfy the demand. If more capacity is needed later, the Provisioning Manager can activate more capacity up to the maximum allowed increase.

Multiple offering records can be pre-staged on the SE HDD. Changing the content of the offerings (if necessary) also is possible.

ager can activate more capacity up to the maximum allowed increase.

Multiple offering records can be pre-staged on the SE HDD. Changing the content of the offerings (if necessary) also is possible.

Remember: CPM controls capacity tokens for the On/Off CoD records. In a situation where a capacity token is used, the system deactivates the corresponding offering record. Therefore, you must prepare routines for catching the warning messages about capacity tokens being used, and have administrative procedures in place for such a situation.

The messages from the system begin five days before a capacity token is fully used. To avoid capacity records being deactivated in this situation, replenish the necessary capacity tokens before they are used.



--- Chunk 8687 ---
es from the system begin five days before a capacity token is fully used. To avoid capacity records being deactivated in this situation, replenish the necessary capacity tokens before they are used.

The CPM operates based on Workload Manager (WLM) indications, and the construct that is used is the Performance Index (PI) of a service class period. It is important to select service class periods that are suitable for the business application that needs more capacity.

For example, the application in question might be running through several service class periods, where the first period is the important one. The application might be defined as importance level 2 or 3, but might depend on other work that is running with importance level 1. Therefore, it is important to consider which workloads to control and which service class periods to specify.

8.8  System Recovery Boost Upgrade



--- Chunk 8688 ---
 other work that is running with importance level 1. Therefore, it is important to consider which workloads to control and which service class periods to specify.

8.8  System Recovery Boost Upgrade

Important: The base System Recovery Boost capability is built into IBM z16 firmware and does not require ordering more features. System Recovery Boost Upgrade (consisting of FC 9930 and FC 6802) is an optional, orderable feature that provides more temporary zIIP capacity for use during boost periods. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 is only needed if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.



--- Chunk 8689 ---
 Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 is only needed if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade optional feature is offered with IBM z16 A01 to provide more capacity for System Recovery Boost processing. For example, if a z/OS operating system change requires a sequence of system shutdowns and restarts, and these procedures can benefit from extra CPU capacity, the System Recovery Boost record can be used to activate more zIIPs on the server at the commencement of the change window. These zIIPs are used by the z/OS systems to run general CP work during the boost periods.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade requires the following feature codes:

- /SM590000 FC 6802: System Recovery Boost Record



--- Chunk 8690 ---
 used by the z/OS systems to run general CP work during the boost periods.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade requires the following feature codes:

- /SM590000 FC 6802: System Recovery Boost Record

This feature code provides extra zIIP capacity (20 zIIP records for 1 - 5 years, orderable by FC 6799, and must be renewed if expired) for use in System Recovery Boost events (shutdown, restart/IPL, and stand-alone memory dumps).

Note: At least one permanent zIIP record must be present for ordering System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 6802).

- /SM590000 FC 9930: Boost Authorization contract

This code enables the ordering of On/Off CoD for System Recovery Boost through Resource Link.

or ordering System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 6802).

- /SM590000 FC 9930: Boost Authorization contract

This code enables the ordering of On/Off CoD for System Recovery Boost through Resource Link.

Important: The System Recovery Boost Upgrade record is for System Recovery Boost capacity only. It cannot be used for peak workload management. The customer must deactivate the boost capacity at the end of the system boost procedure. The zIIP capacity that is provided in the SRB Record is for LPAR shutdown and startup (IPL and Catchup) and is not available for process boost events.

The zIIP processors that can be activated by System Recovery Boost record come from the 'dark core' capacity on the server. They can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively.

The base system configuration must have sufficient memory and channels to accommodate the potential requirements of the larger capacity system.

ver. They can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively.

The base system configuration must have sufficient memory and channels to accommodate the potential requirements of the larger capacity system.

Note: The System Recovery Boost configuration is activated temporarily and provides up to a maximum of 20 extra zIIPs to the system's original, permanent configuration and can violate the 2:1 zIIP rule. The number of zIIPs that can be activated is limited by the unused capacity that is available on the system.

When activating the System Recovery Boost record, the extra zIIPs are added to the zIIP pool when they are activated. Review the LPAR zIIP assignments and weights in the image profiles to ensure that the LPAR can use the extra capacity when it becomes available.

Configure a quantity for the initial and reserved zIIPs in the image profile so that extra zIIPs can be brought online dynamically when the boost record is activated. Also, consider adjusting the LPAR zIIP weight.



--- Chunk 8693 ---
ntity for the initial and reserved zIIPs in the image profile so that extra zIIPs can be brought online dynamically when the boost record is activated. Also, consider adjusting the LPAR zIIP weight.

This feature can be ordered in the range of 1 - 5 years. Only one record can be installed on a system and it must be replenished before it can be used again (if expired).

A System Recovery Boost Upgrade contract (through FC 9930) must be in place before the special code that enables this capability can be installed on the system.

8.9  Capacity for Planned Event

The Capacity Planned Event feature (6833) can no longer be ordered for a new IBM z16; however, if installed on the base system, the record is brought forward during an upgrade into IBM z16 (by way of the support element Save/Restore process). Also, the CPE record cannot be replenished through e-configuration or IBM Resource Link.

Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is a new CoD offering that is available on IBM z16 machines. This offering allows processing capacity flexibility between an organization's primary site and alternative data centers.

Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is designed to provide increased flexibility and control to organizations that want to shift production capacity between participating IBM z16 servers at different sites. The capacity of any engine type can be shifted up to 12 times annually and stay at the target machine for up to 12 months after the flexible capacity record activation on the target machine. Capacity shifts can be done under full customer control without IBM intervention and can be fully automated by using IBM GDPS automation tools.

The CBU entitlement record (FC 6818) contains an expiration date that is established at the time of the order. This date depends on the quantity of CBU years (FC 6817). You can extend your CBU entitlements through the purchase of more CBU years.

The number of FC 6817 per instance of FC 6818 remains limited to five. Fractional years are rounded up to the nearest whole integer when calculating this limit.

If two years and eight months exist before the expiration date at the time of the order, the expiration date can be extended by no more than two years. One test activation is provided for each CBU year that is added to the CBU entitlement record.

FC 6805 allows for ordering more tests in increments of one. The maximum number of tests that is allowed is 15 for each FC 6818.

vided for each CBU year that is added to the CBU entitlement record.

FC 6805 allows for ordering more tests in increments of one. The maximum number of tests that is allowed is 15 for each FC 6818.

The processors that can be activated by CBU come from the available unassigned PUs on any installed processor drawer. A maximum of 200 CBU features that can be ordered. The number of features that can be activated is limited by the number of unused PUs on the system; for example:

- /SM590000 An IBM z16 Max 39 with Capacity Model Identifier 401 can activate up to 39 CBU features. These CBU features can be used to change the capacity setting of the CPs, and to activate unused PUs.
- /SM590000 An IBM z16 Max 82 CMI 715 with 15 CPs, 4 IFLs, and 1 ICF has 62 unused PUs available. It can activate up to 62 CBU features.



--- Chunk 8701 ---

- /SM590000 An IBM z16 Max 82 CMI 715 with 15 CPs, 4 IFLs, and 1 ICF has 62 unused PUs available. It can activate up to 62 CBU features.

The ordering system allows for over-configuration in the order. You can order up to 200 CBU features, regardless of the current configuration. However, at activation, only the capacity that is installed can be activated. At activation, you can decide to activate only a subset of the CBU features that are ordered for the system.

Sub-capacity makes a difference in the way that the CBU features are completed. On the full-capacity models, the CBU features indicate the amount of extra capacity that is needed. If the amount of necessary CBU capacity is equal to four CPs, the CBU configuration is four CBU CPs.



--- Chunk 8702 ---
 the full-capacity models, the CBU features indicate the amount of extra capacity that is needed. If the amount of necessary CBU capacity is equal to four CPs, the CBU configuration is four CBU CPs.

The sub-capacity models feature multiple capacity settings of 4 xx , 5 yy , or 6 yy . The standard models use the capacity setting 7 nn . To change the capacity setting, the number of CBU CPs must be equal to or greater than the number of CPs in the base configuration.

For example, if the base configuration is a two-way 402, two CBU feature codes are required to provide a CBU configuration of a four-way of the same capacity setting. If the required CBU capacity changes the capacity setting of the CPs, going from model capacity identifier 402 to a CBU configuration of a four-way 504 requires four CBU feature codes with a capacity setting of 5 yy .



--- Chunk 8703 ---
 capacity changes the capacity setting of the CPs, going from model capacity identifier 402 to a CBU configuration of a four-way 504 requires four CBU feature codes with a capacity setting of 5 yy .

If the capacity setting of the CPs is changed, more CBU features are required, not more physical PUs. Therefore, your CBU contract requires more CBU features when the capacity setting of the CPs is changed.

CBU can add CPs through LICCC only, and the IBM z16 A01 must have the correct number of installed processor drawers to allow the required upgrade. CBU can change the model capacity identifier to a higher value than the base setting (4 xx , 5 yy , or 6 yy ), but the CBU feature cannot decrease the capacity setting.

A CBU contract must be in place before the special code that enables this capability can be installed on the system. CBU features can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively. For each system enabled for CBU, the authorization to use CBU is available for 1 - 5 years.

s this capability can be installed on the system. CBU features can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively. For each system enabled for CBU, the authorization to use CBU is available for 1 - 5 years.

The alternative configuration is activated temporarily , and provides more capacity than the system's original, permanent configuration. At activation time, determine the capacity that you require for that situation. You can decide to activate only a subset of the capacity that is specified in the CBU contract.

The base system configuration must have sufficient memory and channels to accommodate the potential requirements of the large CBU target system. Ensure that all required functions and resources are available on the backup systems. These functions include CF LEVELs for coupling facility partitions, memory, and cryptographic functions, and connectivity capabilities.

d functions and resources are available on the backup systems. These functions include CF LEVELs for coupling facility partitions, memory, and cryptographic functions, and connectivity capabilities.

When the emergency is over (or the CBU test is complete), the system must be returned to its original configuration. The CBU features can be deactivated at any time before the expiration date. Failure to deactivate the CBU feature before the expiration date can cause the system to downgrade resources gracefully to the original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines, or the last of in-use shared engines.

Planning: CBU for processors provides a concurrent upgrade. This upgrade can result in more enabled processors, changed capacity settings that are available to a system configuration, or both. You can activate a subset of the CBU features that are ordered for the system. Therefore, more planning and tasks are required for nondisruptive logical upgrades.

8.10.2  CBU activation and deactivation

The activation and deactivation of the CBU function is your responsibility and does not require the onsite presence of IBM SSRs. The CBU function is activated or deactivated concurrently from the HMC by using the API. On the SE, CBU is activated by using the Perform Model Conversion task or through the API. The API enables task automation.

CBU activation

CBU is activated from:

- /SM590000 The SE by using the HMC and SSO to the SE
- /SM590000 By using the Perform Model Conversion task
- /SM590000 Through automation by using the API on the SE or the HMC

During a real disaster, use the Activate CBU option to activate the 90-day period.

Image upgrades

After CBU activation, the IBM z16 can have more capacity, more active PUs, or both. The extra resources go into the resource pools and are available to the LPARs. If the LPARs must increase their share of the resources, the LPAR weight can be changed or the number of logical processors can be concurrently increased by configuring reserved processors online. The operating system must concurrently configure more processors online. If necessary, more LPARs can be created to use the newly added capacity.

--- Chunk 8709 ---
guring reserved processors online. The operating system must concurrently configure more processors online. If necessary, more LPARs can be created to use the newly added capacity.

CBU deactivation

To deactivate the CBU, the extra resources must be released from the LPARs by the operating systems. In some cases, this process involves varying the resources offline. In other cases, it can mean shutting down operating systems or deactivating LPARs. After the resources are released, the same facility on the HMC/SE is used to turn off CBU. To deactivate CBU, select the Undo temporary upgrade option from the Perform Model Conversion task on the SE.

Test CBUs are provided as part of the CBU contract. CBU is activated from the SE by using the Perform Model Conversion task. Select the test option to start a 10-day test period. A standard contract allows one test per CBU year. However, you can order more tests in increments of one up to a maximum of 15 for each CBU order.

lect the test option to start a 10-day test period. A standard contract allows one test per CBU year. However, you can order more tests in increments of one up to a maximum of 15 for each CBU order.

Tip: The CBU test activation is done the same way as the real activation; that is, by using the same SE Perform a Model Conversion window and selecting the Temporary upgrades option. The HMC windows were changed to avoid accidental real CBU activations by setting the test activation as the default option.

The test CBU must be deactivated in the same way as the regular CBU. Failure to deactivate the CBU feature before the expiration date can cause the system to degrade gracefully back to its original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines or the last in-use shared engine.

ore the expiration date can cause the system to degrade gracefully back to its original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines or the last in-use shared engine.

CBU example

An example of a CBU operation is shown in Figure 8-15. The permanent configuration is a 504, and a record contains seven CP CBU features. During an activation, multiple target configurations are available. With 7 CP CBU features, you can add up to 7CPs within the same MCI, which allows the activation of a 506, 507, through to a 511(the blue path).

Alternatively, 4 CP CBU features can be used to change the MCI (in the example from a 504 to a 704) and then add the remaining 3 CP CBU features to upgrade to a 707 (the red path).

8.10.3  Automatic CBU enablement for GDPS

The IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS) enables automatic management of the PUs that are provided by the CBU feature during a system or site failure. Upon detection of a site failure or planned disaster test, GDPS concurrently adds CPs to the systems in the take-over site to restore processing power for mission-critical production workloads. GDPS automation runs the following tasks:



--- Chunk 8713 ---
lanned disaster test, GDPS concurrently adds CPs to the systems in the take-over site to restore processing power for mission-critical production workloads. GDPS automation runs the following tasks:

- /SM590000 The analysis that is required to determine the scope of the failure. This process minimizes operator intervention and the potential for errors.
- /SM590000 Automates authentication and activation of the reserved CPs.
- /SM590000 Automatically restarts the critical applications after reserved CP activation.
- /SM590000 Reduces the outage time to restart critical workloads from several hours to minutes.

The GDPS service is for z/OS only, or for z/OS in combination with Linux on Z.

Site swap example

Figure 8-16 on page 371 - Figure 8-18 on page 372 show a sequence of events to move capacity from one site to another by using the Flexible Capacity features of the IBM z16.

A Flexible Capacity record is installed on the machines at each site. The machine at Site A has the base capacity that is configured at the same level as the high water mark of the Site B machine and has flex capacity that is activated to its HWM.

The flex capacity is then added to the machine at Site B, which brings it up to the Site A HWM and workload is transferred.

After all workload is transferred (within 24 hours), the capacity of the Site A machine is reduced to the base level. Workload can continue to run at Site B for up to a year.

8.12  Planning for nondisruptive upgrades

Continuous availability is an important requirement for customers, and planned outages are no longer acceptable. Although Parallel Sysplex clustering technology is the best continuous availability solution for z/OS environments, nondisruptive upgrades within a single system can avoid system outages and cover non-z/OS operating systems.



--- Chunk 8874 ---
clustering technology is the best continuous availability solution for z/OS environments, nondisruptive upgrades within a single system can avoid system outages and cover non-z/OS operating systems.

IBM z16 allows concurrent upgrades, which means that dynamically adding capacity to the system is possible. If the operating system images that run on the upgraded system do not require disruptive tasks to use the new capacity, the upgrade is also nondisruptive . This process avoids power-on resets (POR), LPAR deactivation, and IPLs.

If the concurrent upgrade is intended to satisfy an image upgrade to an LPAR, the operating system that is running in this partition must concurrently configure more capacity online. z/OS operating systems include this capability. z/VM can concurrently configure new processors and I/O devices online, and memory can be dynamically added to z/VM partitions.

e more capacity online. z/OS operating systems include this capability. z/VM can concurrently configure new processors and I/O devices online, and memory can be dynamically added to z/VM partitions.

If the concurrent upgrade is intended to satisfy the need for more operating system images, more LPARs can be created concurrently on the IBM z16 system. These LPARs include all resources that are needed. These extra LPARs can be activated concurrently.

These enhanced configuration options are available through the HSA, which is an IBM reserved area in system memory.

In general, Linux operating systems cannot add more resources concurrently. However, Linux and other types of virtual machines that run under z/VM can benefit from the z/VM capability to nondisruptively configure more resources online (processors and I/O).

ces concurrently. However, Linux and other types of virtual machines that run under z/VM can benefit from the z/VM capability to nondisruptively configure more resources online (processors and I/O).

With z/VM, Linux guests can manipulate their logical processors by using the Linux CPU hotplug daemon. The daemon can start and stop logical processors that are based on the Linux load average value. The daemon is available in Linux SLES 10 SP2 and later, and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) V5R4 and up.

8.12.1  Components

The following components can be added, depending on the considerations as described in this section:

- /SM590000 PUs
- /SM590000 Memory
- /SM590000 I/O
- /SM590000 Cryptographic adapters
- /SM590000 Special features

- /SM590000 Memory
- /SM590000 I/O
- /SM590000 Cryptographic adapters
- /SM590000 Special features

PUs

CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and SAPs can be added concurrently to an IBM z16 if unassigned PUs are available on any installed processor drawer. The number of zIIPs cannot exceed twice the number of CPs. The IBM z16 allows the concurrent addition of a second and third processor drawer if the CPC reserve features are installed.

If necessary, more LPARs can be created concurrently to use the newly added processors.

The Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC) also can configure more processors online to coupling facility LPARs by using the CFCC image operations window.

Memory

 to use the newly added processors.

The Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC) also can configure more processors online to coupling facility LPARs by using the CFCC image operations window.

Memory

Memory can be added concurrently up to the physical installed memory limit. More processor drawers can be installed concurrently, which allows further memory upgrades by LICCC, and enables memory capacity on the new processor drawers.

By using the previously defined reserved memory, z/OS operating system images, and z/VM partitions, you can dynamically configure more memory online. This process allows nondisruptive memory upgrades. Linux on Z supports Dynamic Storage Reconfiguration.

I/O

I/O features can be added concurrently if all the required infrastructure (I/O slots and PCIe Fan-outs) is present in the configuration. PCIe+ I/O drawers can be added concurrently without planning if free space is available in one of the frames and the configuration permits.

 slots and PCIe Fan-outs) is present in the configuration. PCIe+ I/O drawers can be added concurrently without planning if free space is available in one of the frames and the configuration permits.

Dynamic I/O configuration changes are supported by specific operating systems (z/OS and z/VM), which allows for nondisruptive I/O upgrades. Dynamic I/O reconfiguration on a stand-alone coupling facility system also is possible by using the Dynamic I/O activation for stand-alone CF CPCs features.

Cryptographic adapters

Crypto Express8S features can be added concurrently if all the required infrastructure is in the configuration.

Special features

Special features, such as zHyperlink, Coupling Express2 LR, and RoCE features can be added concurrently if all infrastructure is available in the configuration.

8.12.2  Concurrent upgrade considerations

By using an MES upgrade, On/Off CoD, CBU, or CPE, an IBM Z server can be upgraded concurrently from one model to another (temporarily or permanently).

Enabling and using the extra processor capacity is not apparent to most applications. However, specific programs depend on processor model-related information, such as ISV products. Consider the effect on the software that is running on an IBM z16 when you perform any of these configuration upgrades.

Processor identification

The following instructions are used to obtain processor information:

ct on the software that is running on an IBM z16 when you perform any of these configuration upgrades.

Processor identification

The following instructions are used to obtain processor information:

- /SM590000 Store System Information (STSI) instruction
- The STSI instruction can be used to obtain information about the current execution environment and any processing level that is below the current environment. It can be used to obtain processor model and model capacity identifier information from the basic machine configuration form of the system information block (SYSIB). It supports concurrent upgrades and is the recommended way to request processor information.
- /SM590000 Store CPU ID (STIDP) instruction
- STIDP returns information that identifies the execution environment, system serial number, and machine type.

Note: To ensure unique identification of the configuration of the issuing CPU, use the STSI instruction specifying basic machine configuration (SYSIB 1.1.1).



--- Chunk 8882 ---
system serial number, and machine type.

Note: To ensure unique identification of the configuration of the issuing CPU, use the STSI instruction specifying basic machine configuration (SYSIB 1.1.1).

Store System Information instruction

The format of the basic machine configuration SYSIB that is returned by the STSI instruction is shown in Figure 8-19. The STSI instruction returns the model capacity identifier for the permanent configuration and the model capacity identifier for any temporary capacity. This data is key to the functioning of CoD offerings.

<!-- missing-text -->

The model capacity identifier contains the base capacity, On/Off CoD, and CBU. The Model Permanent Capacity Identifier and the Model Permanent Capacity Rating contain the base capacity of the system. The Model Temporary Capacity Identifier and Model Temporary Capacity Rating contain the base capacity and On/Off CoD.



--- Chunk 8883 ---

Planning for nondisruptive upgrades

Online permanent upgrades, On/Off CoD, CBU, and CPE can be used to upgrade an IBM Z server concurrently. However, specific situations require a disruptive task to enable capacity that was recently added to the system. Some of these situations can be avoided if planning is done. Planning is a key factor for nondisruptive upgrades.

In a multi-site high-availability configuration, another option is the use of Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resilience to move workload to another site while hardware maintenance is performed.

Disruptive upgrades are performed for the following reasons:



--- Chunk 9058 ---
er option is the use of Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resilience to move workload to another site while hardware maintenance is performed.

Disruptive upgrades are performed for the following reasons:

- /SM590000 LPAR memory upgrades when reserved storage was not previously defined are disruptive to image upgrades. z/OS and z/VM support this function.
- /SM590000 An I/O upgrade when the operating system cannot use the dynamic I/O configuration function is disruptive to that partition. Linux, z/VSE, and z/TPF do not support dynamic I/O configuration.

You can minimize the need for these outages by carefully planning and reviewing 'Guidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades' on page 377.

- /SM590000 By using an SE function that is called Logical Processor add, which is under Operational Customization tasks, CPs and zIIPs can be added concurrently to a running partition. The CP and zIIP and initial or reserved number of processors can be changed dynamically.
- /SM590000 The operating system that runs in the targeted LPAR must support the dynamic addition of resources and to configure processors online. The total number of defined and reserved CPs cannot exceed the number of CPs that are supported by the operating system.
- z/OS V2.R5, V2.R4, and V2.R3 support 200 PUs per z/OS LPAR in non-SMT mode and 128 PUs per z/OS LPAR in SMT mode. For both, the PU total is the sum of CPs and zIIPs . z/VM supports up to 64 processors.

- /SM590000 Configure reserved storage to LPARs.
- Configuring reserved storage for all LPARs before their activation enables them to be nondisruptively upgraded. The operating system that is running in the LPAR must configure memory online. The amount of reserved storage can be greater than the CPC drawer threshold limit, even if no other CPC drawer is installed.
- With IBM z16 servers, the current partition storage limit is 4 TB for z/OS V2.R3 and V2.R4, and 16 TB for z/OS V2.R5 and later. z/VM V7.R1 supports 2 TB and z/VM V7.R2 supports 4 TB memory partitions.

- Use a convenient entry point for memory capacity, and select memory options that allow future upgrades within the memory cards that are installed on the CPC drawers.

For more information about the offerings, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

Considerations when installing CPC drawers

During an upgrade, a second and third processor drawer can be installed concurrently if they are planned. Depending on the number of processor drawers in the upgrade and your I/O configuration, a fan-out rebalancing might be needed for availability reasons.

A fourth or fifth processor drawer can be installed at the IBM Manufacturing plant only.

8.13  Summary of Capacity on-Demand offerings

The CoD infrastructure and its offerings are based on client requirements for more flexibility, granularity, and better business control over the IBM Z infrastructure, operationally, and financially.



--- Chunk 9261 ---
he CoD infrastructure and its offerings are based on client requirements for more flexibility, granularity, and better business control over the IBM Z infrastructure, operationally, and financially.

One major client requirement was to eliminate the need for a client authorization connection to the IBM Resource Link system when activating an offering. This requirement is met by the IBM z14, IBM z15, and IBM z16 servers.

After the offerings are installed on the IBM z16 SE, they can be activated at any time at the customer's discretion. No intervention by IBM or IBM personnel is necessary. In addition, the activation of CBU does not require a password.

The IBM z16 A01 can have up to eight offerings that are installed at the same time, with the limitation that only one of them can be an On/Off CoD offering, and only one can be an SRB Upgrade record. The others can be any combination.



--- Chunk 9262 ---
 offerings that are installed at the same time, with the limitation that only one of them can be an On/Off CoD offering, and only one can be an SRB Upgrade record. The others can be any combination.

The installed offerings can be activated fully or partially, and in any sequence and any combination. The offerings can be controlled manually through command interfaces on the HMC, or programmatically through a number of APIs. IBM applications, ISV programs, and client-written applications can control the use of the offerings.

Resource usage (and therefore, financial exposure) can be controlled by using capacity tokens in the On/Off CoD offering records.

The CPM is an example of an application that uses the CoD APIs to provision On/Off CoD capacity that is based on the requirements of the workload. The CPM cannot control other offerings.

Reliability, availability, and serviceability

From the quality perspective, the IBM z16 reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) design is driven by a set of high-level program RAS objectives. The IBM Z platform continues to drive toward Continuous Reliable Operation (CRO) at the single footprint level.

Note: Throughout this chapter, IBM z16 refers to IBM z16 Model A01 (Machine Type 3931).

The key objectives, in order of priority, are to ensure data integrity, computational integrity, reduce or eliminate unscheduled outages, reduce scheduled outages, reduce planned outages, and reduce the number of Repair Actions.



--- Chunk 9264 ---
f priority, are to ensure data integrity, computational integrity, reduce or eliminate unscheduled outages, reduce scheduled outages, reduce planned outages, and reduce the number of Repair Actions.

RAS can be accomplished with improved concurrent replace, repair, and upgrade functions for processors, memory, drawers, and I/O. RAS also extends to the nondisruptive capability for installing Licensed Internal Code (LIC) updates. In most cases, a capacity upgrade can be concurrent without a system outage. As an extension to the RAS capabilities, environmental controls are implemented in the system to help reduce power consumption and meet cooling requirements.

This chapter includes the following topics:

9.1  RAS strategy

The RAS strategy is to manage change by learning from previous generations and investing in new RAS function to eliminate or minimize all sources of outages. Enhancements that were introduced with IBM z15 RAS designs are implemented on the IBM z16 design through the introduction of new technology, structure, and requirements. Continuous improvements in RAS are associated with new features and functions to ensure that IBM Z servers deliver exceptional value to clients.

The following overriding RAS requirements are principles as shown in Figure 9-1:

AS are associated with new features and functions to ensure that IBM Z servers deliver exceptional value to clients.

The following overriding RAS requirements are principles as shown in Figure 9-1:

- /SM590000 Include existing (or equivalent) RAS characteristics from previous generations.
- /SM590000 Learn from current field issues and addressing the deficiencies.
- /SM590000 Understand the trend in technology reliability (hard and soft) and ensure that the RAS design points are sufficiently robust.
- /SM590000 Invest in RAS design enhancements (hardware and firmware) that provide IBM Z and Customer valued differentiation.

9.2.1  Processor Unit chip

IBM z16 uses the Processor Unit (PU) chip with the following technical changes:

- /SM590000 A PU chip is implemented by using EUV process with 7 nm FinFET lithography, and has eight cores (PUs) per chip (design) that are running at 5.2 GHz.
- /SM590000 Each core has private L1 (instruction and data) caches and a semi-private L2 cache, which are 32 MB. The eight cores and L2 caches on the chip communicate through bidirectional high-speed on-chip ring and with all SMP, I/O, and memory interfaces (see Figure 9-2 on page 381).

- /SM590000 The processor recovery logic is on the DCM and includes the following RAS characteristics:
- -PU refresh for soft errors
- -Hardened RU (recovery unit) with wordline failure detection
- -Improved latch interleaving (spacing) for soft error resistance
- -Core sparing for hard errors: All servers ship with two spare cores
- -Improved long-term thresholding
- -Redesigned nest
- -Concurrent repair by way of concurrent drawer repair (CDR)
- -Concurrent upgrade by way of LICCC and enhanced drawer availability (EDA)
- /SM590000 L1 and L1 shadow: L1 shadow is new on IBM z16 and includes the following characteristics:
- -Behaves like the L1 (for repairs)
- -Contains changed data
- -All unrecoverable error (UE) checkstop core: UEs are refetched before acting
- -UE impact depends on system state:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Before end OP, IPD without storage validity
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Before SIE sync, System Damage
- /SM590000 IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI (AIU)

- /SM590000 IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI (AIU)
- AIU is an on-chip AI Accelerator, which is new on IBM z16. AIU behaves like a co-processor to process the synchronous instructions, but AIU is in nest. The core control the AIU by issuing instruction (NNPA):
- -The array macro has row and column repair (MD and ABIST)
- -1 MB cache with single error correction double error detection (SECDEC) ECC
- /SM590000 On-chip L2, caches are implemented in dense SRAM. The IBM z16 removed the physical L3 (on-chip for IBM z15) and L4 (on extra storage controller single chip module - SC SCM) and implemented clustered cache algorithms that provide virtualized L3 (shared victim) and virtual L4 (shared victim) caches (see Figure 9-4).

9.6  IBM z16 availability characteristics

The following functions include availability characteristics on IBM z16:

- /SM590000 Enhanced drawer availability (EDA)

EDA is a procedure under which a CPC drawer in a multi-drawer system can be removed and reinstalled during an upgrade or repair action with no effect on the workload.

- /SM590000 Concurrent memory upgrade or replacement

Memory can be upgraded concurrently by using Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) if physical memory is available on the drawers.

The EDA function can be useful if the physical memory cards must be changed in a multi-drawer configuration (requiring the drawer to be removed).



--- Chunk 9883 ---
CC) if physical memory is available on the drawers.

The EDA function can be useful if the physical memory cards must be changed in a multi-drawer configuration (requiring the drawer to be removed).

It requires the availability of more memory resources on other drawers or reducing the need for memory resources during this action. Select the flexible memory option to help ensure that the suitable level of memory is available in a multiple-drawer configuration. This option provides more resources to use EDA when repairing a drawer or memory on a drawer. They also are available when upgrading memory when larger memory cards might be required.

- /SM590000 Concurrent Driver Maintenance (CDM)

One of the greatest contributors to downtime during planned outages is LIC driver updates that are performed in support of new features and functions. IBM z16 supports the concurrent activation of a selected new driver level.

- /SM590000 Plan Ahead for Balanced Power (FC 3003)

r updates that are performed in support of new features and functions. IBM z16 supports the concurrent activation of a selected new driver level.

- /SM590000 Plan Ahead for Balanced Power (FC 3003)

This feature allows you to order the maximum number of bulk power regulators (BPRs) on any server configuration. This feature helps to ensure that your configuration is in a balanced power environment if you intend to add CPC drawers and I/O drawers to your server in the future. The feature is available with Bulk Power Adapters (BPA) only.

- /SM590000 Concurrent fan-out addition or replacement

A PCIe+ fan-out card provides the path for data between memory and I/O through PCIe cables. With IBM z16, a hot-pluggable and concurrently upgradeable fan-out card is available. Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards per CPC drawer are available for IBM z16 servers. An IBM z16 Model A01 feature Max168 and Max200 hold four CPC drawers and can have 48 PCIe fan out slots.



--- Chunk 9885 ---
d is available. Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards per CPC drawer are available for IBM z16 servers. An IBM z16 Model A01 feature Max168 and Max200 hold four CPC drawers and can have 48 PCIe fan out slots.

Internal I/O paths from the CPC drawer fan-out ports to a PCIe drawer or an I/O drawer are spread across multiple CPC drawers (for feature Max71, Max108, Max145, and Max190) and across different nodes within a single CPC drawer Feature Max34. During an outage, a fan-out card that is used for I/O can be repaired concurrently while redundant I/O interconnect ensures that no I/O connectivity is lost.

- /SM590000 Redundant I/O interconnect

Redundant I/O interconnect helps maintain critical connections to devices. IBM z16 A01 allows a single drawer in a multi-drawer system to be removed and reinstalled concurrently during an upgrade or repair. Connectivity to the system I/O resources is maintained through a second path from a different drawer.

- /SM590000 Base Management Card (BMC)/Oscillator Cards (OSC)

IBM z16 A01 features two combined BMC and OSC per CPU draw. The strategy of redundant clock and switchover stays the same. One primary and one backup is available. If the primary OSC fails, the backup detects the failure, takes over transparently, and continues to provide the clock signal to the CPC.

- /SM590000 Processor unit (PU) sparing

IBM z16 A01has two spare PUs per system to maintain performance levels if an active PU, Internal Coupling Facility (ICF), Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL), IBM Z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP), integrated firmware processor (IFP), or system assist processor (SAP) fails. Transparent sparing for failed processors is supported and sparing is supported across the drawers.



--- Chunk 9887 ---
ion Processor (zIIP), integrated firmware processor (IFP), or system assist processor (SAP) fails. Transparent sparing for failed processors is supported and sparing is supported across the drawers.

- /SM590000 Application preservation

This function is used when a PU fails and no spares are available. The state of the failing PU is passed to another active PU, where the operating system uses it to successfully resume the task (in most cases, without customer intervention).

- /SM590000 Cooling change

The IBM z16 air-cooled configuration includes a front-to-rear radiator cooling system. The radiator pumps, blowers, controls, and sensors are N+1 redundant. In normal operation, one active pump supports the system. A second pump is turned on and the original pump is turned off periodically, which improves reliability of the pumps. The replacement of pumps or blowers is concurrent with no effect on performance.

Note: Customer chilled water (WCU) is not offered on IBM z16.

periodically, which improves reliability of the pumps. The replacement of pumps or blowers is concurrent with no effect on performance.

Note: Customer chilled water (WCU) is not offered on IBM z16.

- /SM590000 FICON Express 32S with Forward Error Correction (FEC)

FICON Express32S features continue to provide a new standard for transmitting data over 32 Gbps links by using 64b/66b encoding. The new standard that is defined by T11.org FC-FS-3 is more efficient than the current 8b/10b encoding.

FICON Express32S channels that are running at 32 Gbps can take advantage of FEC capabilities when connected to devices that support FEC.

FEC allows FICON Express32S channels to operate at higher speeds, over longer distances, with reduced power and higher throughput. They also retain the same reliability and robustness for which FICON channels are traditionally known.



--- Chunk 9889 ---
s to operate at higher speeds, over longer distances, with reduced power and higher throughput. They also retain the same reliability and robustness for which FICON channels are traditionally known.

FEC is a technique that is used for controlling errors in data transmission over unreliable or noisy communication channels. When running at 32 Gbps link speeds, customers often see fewer I/O errors, which reduces the potential effect to production workloads from those I/O errors.

Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) improve Fault Isolation. After a link error is detected (for example, IFCC, CC3, reset event, or a link incident report), link data that is returned from Read Diagnostic Parameters is used to differentiate between errors that result from failures in the optics versus failures because of dirty or faulty links.

- /SM590000 FICON Dynamic Routing

FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR) enables the use of storage area network (SAN) dynamic routing policies in the fabric. With the IBM z16, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static routing policies for inter-switch links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors.

N) dynamic routing policies in the fabric. With the IBM z16, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static routing policies for inter-switch links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors.

FICON Dynamic Routing dynamically changes the routing between the channel and control unit that is based on the Fibre Channel Exchange ID. Each I/O operation has a unique exchange ID. FIDR supports static SAN routing policies and dynamic routing policies.

FICON Dynamic Routing can help clients reduce costs by providing the following features:

- -Share SANs between their FICON and FCP traffic.
- -Improve performance because of SAN dynamic routing policies that better use all of the available ISL bandwidth through higher use of the ISLs,
- -Simplify management of their SAN fabrics by using static routing policies that assign different ISL routes with each power-on-reset (POR), which makes the SAN fabric performance difficult to predict.



--- Chunk 9893 ---
implify management of their SAN fabrics by using static routing policies that assign different ISL routes with each power-on-reset (POR), which makes the SAN fabric performance difficult to predict.

Customers must ensure that all devices in their FICON SAN support FICON Dynamic Routing before they implement this feature.

9.7  IBM z16 RAS functions

Hardware RAS function improvements focus on addressing all sources of outages. Sources of outages feature the following classifications:

- /SM590000 Unscheduled

This outage occurs because of an unrecoverable malfunction in a hardware component of the system.

- /SM590000 Scheduled

This outage is caused by changes or updates that must be done to the system in a timely fashion. A scheduled outage can be caused by a disruptive patch that must be installed, or other changes that must be made to the system.

- /SM590000 Planned



--- Chunk 9894 ---
 must be done to the system in a timely fashion. A scheduled outage can be caused by a disruptive patch that must be installed, or other changes that must be made to the system.

- /SM590000 Planned

This outage is caused by changes or updates that must be done to the system. A planned outage can be caused by a capacity upgrade or a driver upgrade. A planned outage usually is requested by the customer, and often requires planning. The IBM z16 design phase focuses on enhancing planning to simplify or eliminate planned outages.

The difference between scheduled outages and planned outages might not be obvious. The general consensus is that scheduled outages occur sometime soon. The timeframe is approximately two weeks.

Planned outages are outages that are planned well in advance and go beyond this approximate two-week timeframe. This chapter does not distinguish between scheduled and planned outages.

y two weeks.

Planned outages are outages that are planned well in advance and go beyond this approximate two-week timeframe. This chapter does not distinguish between scheduled and planned outages.

Preventing unscheduled, scheduled, and planned outages was addressed by the IBM Z system design for many years.

IBM z16 A01 has a fixed size HSA of 256 GB. This size helps eliminate planning requirements for HSA and provides the flexibility to update dynamically the configuration. You can perform the following tasks dynamically: 1

- /SM590000 Add:
- -Logical partition (LPAR)
- -Logical channel subsystem (LCSS)
- -Subchannel set
- -Logical PU to an LPAR
- -Cryptographic coprocessor
- -Memory
- -Physical processor
- /SM590000 Remove a cryptographic coprocessor
- /SM590000 Enable I/O connections
- /SM590000 Swap processor types

By addressing the elimination of planned outages, the following tasks also are possible:



--- Chunk 9896 ---
90000 Remove a cryptographic coprocessor
- /SM590000 Enable I/O connections
- /SM590000 Swap processor types

By addressing the elimination of planned outages, the following tasks also are possible:

- /SM590000 Concurrent driver upgrades
- /SM590000 Concurrent and flexible customer-initiated upgrades

For more information about the flexible upgrades that are started by customers, see 8.3.2, 'Customer Initiated Upgrade facility' on page 336.

- /SM590000 STP management of concurrent CTN Split and Merge
- /SM590000 Dynamic I/O for stand-alone CF, Linux on Z and z/TPF running on IBM z16

- /SM590000 STP management of concurrent CTN Split and Merge
- /SM590000 Dynamic I/O for stand-alone CF, Linux on Z and z/TPF running on IBM z16

Dynamic I/O configuration changes can be made to a stand-alone CF, Linux on Z and z/TPF without requiring a disruptive power on reset. A firmware LPAR with a firmware-based appliance version of an HCD instance is used to apply the new I/O configuration changes. The firmware-based LPAR is driven by updates from an HCD instance that is running in a z/OS LPAR on a different IBM z16 CPC that is connected to the same IBM z16 HMA.

- /SM590000 System Recovery Boost Stage 3

System Recovery Boost enhancements for IBM z16 introduce the possibility of significantly reducing the effect of these disruptions by boosting a set of recovery processes that create significant pain points for users.

These recovery processes include the following examples:

9.7.1  Scheduled outages

Concurrent hardware upgrades, parts replacement, driver upgrades, and firmware fixes that are available with IBM z16 all address the elimination of scheduled outages. Also, the following indicators and functions that address scheduled outages are included:

- /SM590000 Memory data bus lane sparing.

This feature reduces the number of repair actions for memory.

- /SM590000 Dual tabbed Memory Clock signals.
- /SM590000 Triple DRAM chipkill tolerance.
- /SM590000 Processor drawer power distribution N +2 design.

duces the number of repair actions for memory.

- /SM590000 Dual tabbed Memory Clock signals.
- /SM590000 Triple DRAM chipkill tolerance.
- /SM590000 Processor drawer power distribution N +2 design.

The CPC drawer uses POL cards in a highly redundant N +2 configuration. POL regulators are daughter cards that contain the voltage regulators for the principle logic voltage boundaries in the IBM z16 CPC drawer. They plug into the CPC drawer system board and are nonconcurrent FRUs for the affected drawer (similar to the memory DIMMs). If you can use EDA, the replacement of POL cards is concurrent for the entire IBM Z server.

- /SM590000 Redundant ( N +1) Ethernet switches.
- /SM590000 Redundant ( N +2) ambient temperature sensors.
- /SM590000 Dual inline memory module (DIMM) field-replaceable unit (FRU) indicators.



--- Chunk 9900 ---
er.

- /SM590000 Redundant ( N +1) Ethernet switches.
- /SM590000 Redundant ( N +2) ambient temperature sensors.
- /SM590000 Dual inline memory module (DIMM) field-replaceable unit (FRU) indicators.

These indicators imply that a memory module is not error-free and might fail eventually. This indicator gives IBM a warning and provides time to concurrently repair the storage module if the IBM z16 is a multi-drawer system.

The process to repair the storage module is to isolate or 'fence off' the drawer, remove the drawer, replace the failing storage module and then, add the drawer. The flexible memory option might be necessary to maintain sufficient capacity while repairing the storage module.

- /SM590000 Single processor core checkstop and sparing.

This indicator shows that a processor core malfunctioned and is spared . IBM determines what to do based on the system and the history of that system.

0 Single processor core checkstop and sparing.

This indicator shows that a processor core malfunctioned and is spared . IBM determines what to do based on the system and the history of that system.

- /SM590000 Point-to-point fabric for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) RAS design
- -The A-bus is the logical bus and it is split over 2 SMP9 cables:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; 11 bits per A-Bus
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; One SMP9 cable has six bits and the other has five bits.
- -CRC detection and replay
- -RAS lane Degrade and Call Home Strategy design
- -Concurrent repair of the SMP9 cable.

Having fewer components that can fail is an advantage. In a multi-drawer system, all of the drawers are connected by point-to-point connections. A drawer can always be added concurrently.

9.7.2  Unscheduled outages

An unscheduled outage occurs because of an unrecoverable malfunction in a hardware component of the system.

The following improvements can minimize unscheduled outages:

- /SM590000 Continued focus on firmware quality

For LIC and hardware design, failures are eliminated through rigorous design rules; design walk-through; peer reviews; element, subsystem, and system simulation; and extensive engineering and manufacturing testing.

- /SM590000 Memory subsystem

Redundant Array of Independent Memory (RAIM) on IBM Z servers is a concept that is similar to the concept of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). The RAIM design detects and recovers from dynamic random access memory (DRAM), socket, memory channel, or DIMM failures. Memory size now includes RAIM protection and recovery.

Memory channels are organized in 8-card RAIM groups that provide 50% reduced RAIM overhead (compared to IBM z15).

RAIM protection is similar to IBM z15:

- -Up to three chip marks and one channel mark
- -DDR4 DRAM with on chip power regulation
- -N+1 voltage regulators



--- Chunk 10105 ---
uced RAIM overhead (compared to IBM z15).

RAIM protection is similar to IBM z15:

- -Up to three chip marks and one channel mark
- -DDR4 DRAM with on chip power regulation
- -N+1 voltage regulators

Memory is implemented by using Standard Open Memory Interface (OMI) with up to six OMIs per drawer, has CRC/Retry for soft errors, degrade bus lanes 4-&gt;2 on hard error, and no waiting for all eight cards (use first seven to respond).

A precise marking of faulty chips helps ensure timely DIMM replacements. The design of the IBM z16 further improved this chip marking technology. Graduated DRAM marking is available, and channel marking and scrubbing calls for replacement on the third DRAM failure is available.

IBM z16 is equipped with the capabilities of soft-switching firmware. Enhanced logic in this function ensures that every affected circuit is powered off during the soft-switching of firmware components. For example, when you are upgrading the microcode of a FICON feature, enhancements are implemented to avoid any unwanted side effects that were detected on previous systems.

- /SM590000 Server Time Protocol (STP) recovery enhancement. IBM z16 updated the clocking structure:
- -System uses a mesosynchronous clocking structure (similar to IBM z15)
- -Two redundant oscillator cards in each drawer with dynamic oscillator switchover
- -STP now has external clock reference support, separate Ethernet ports for ETS
- -PTP and NTP (Ethernet cabling) are now directly connected to the CPC (no SE ETS connection needed)
- -Oscillator card shares FRU package with drawer' Base Control Card (BMC)
- -Concurrent repair of oscillator or control card

- -Concurrent repair of oscillator or control card

A new signal was implemented in IBM z16 hardware for helping with STP recovery. This signal is called N-Mode power signal . In a CTN with PTS and BTS being IBM z16 servers, CTN recovery can be started by the new signal. Systems must have dual power with at least one side of the power capable of holding the power (UPS or similar) for five minutes if a utility power failure occurs.

When PCIe-based integrated communication adapter (ICA) Short Reach (SR) links are used, an unambiguous 'going away signal' is sent when the server on which the coupling link is running is about to enter a failed (check stopped) state.



--- Chunk 10109 ---
tion adapter (ICA) Short Reach (SR) links are used, an unambiguous 'going away signal' is sent when the server on which the coupling link is running is about to enter a failed (check stopped) state.

When the 'going away signal' that is sent by the Current Time Server (CTS) in an STP-only Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) is received by the Backup Time Server (BTS), the BTS can safely take over as the CTS without relying on the previous Offline Signal (OLS) in a two-server CTN, or as the Arbiter in a CTN with three or more servers.

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery (ECAR) contains recovery algorithms during a failing Primary Time Server (PTS) and uses communication over the HMA/SE network to assist with BTS takeover.

For more information, see Chapter 10, 'Hardware Management Console and Support Element' on page 407.

Coupling Express2 LR does not support the 'going away signal'; however, ECAR can be used to assist with recovery in the following configurations:

- /SM590000 Design of pervasive infrastructure controls in processor chips in memory ASICs.
- /SM590000 Improved error checking in the processor recovery unit (RU) to better protect against word line failures in the RU arrays.

9.8  Enhanced drawer availability

EDA is a procedure in which a drawer in a multi-drawer system can be removed and reinstalled during an upgrade or repair action. This procedure has no effect on the running workload with suitable planning and depending on your system configuration. A single CPC drawer IBM z16 A01 does not support EDA.



--- Chunk 10111 ---
pgrade or repair action. This procedure has no effect on the running workload with suitable planning and depending on your system configuration. A single CPC drawer IBM z16 A01 does not support EDA.

The EDA procedure and careful planning help ensure that all the resources are still available to run critical applications in an ( n -1) drawer configuration. This process allows you to avoid planned outages. Consider the flexible memory option to provide more memory resources when you are replacing a drawer.

For more information about flexible memory, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.



--- Chunk 10112 ---
es. Consider the flexible memory option to provide more memory resources when you are replacing a drawer.

For more information about flexible memory, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

To minimize the effect on current workloads, ensure that sufficient inactive physical resources exist on the remaining drawers to complete a drawer removal. Also, consider deactivating noncritical system images, such as test or development LPARs. After you stop these noncritical LPARs and free their resources, you might find sufficient inactive resources to contain critical workloads while completing a drawer replacement.

9.8.1  EDA planning considerations

To use the EDA function, configure enough physical memory and engines so that the loss of a single drawer does not result in any degradation to critical workloads during the following occurrences:



--- Chunk 10113 ---


To use the EDA function, configure enough physical memory and engines so that the loss of a single drawer does not result in any degradation to critical workloads during the following occurrences:

- /SM590000 A degraded restart in the rare event of a drawer failure
- /SM590000 A drawer replacement for repair or a physical memory upgrade

The following configurations especially enable the use of the EDA function. These IBM z16 features need enough spare capacity so that they can cover the resources of a fenced or isolated drawer. This configuration imposes limits on the following number of the client-owned PUs that can be activated when one drawer within a model is fenced:

- /SM590000 A maximum of:
- -39 PUs are configured on the Max39
- -82 PUs are configured on the Max82
- -125 PUs are configured on the Max125
- -168 PUs are configured on the Max168
- -200 PUs are configured on the Max200



--- Chunk 10114 ---
f:
- -39 PUs are configured on the Max39
- -82 PUs are configured on the Max82
- -125 PUs are configured on the Max125
- -168 PUs are configured on the Max168
- -200 PUs are configured on the Max200

- /SM590000 No special feature codes are required for PU and model configuration.
- /SM590000 Feature Max39 to Max168 each have 5 SAPs in each drawer. Max200 has in total 24 standard SAPs.
- /SM590000 The flexible memory option delivers physical memory so that 100% of the purchased memory increment can be activated even when one drawer is fenced.

The system configuration must have sufficient dormant resources on the remaining drawers in the system for the evacuation of the drawer that is to be replaced or upgraded. Dormant resources include the following possibilities:



--- Chunk 10115 ---
t have sufficient dormant resources on the remaining drawers in the system for the evacuation of the drawer that is to be replaced or upgraded. Dormant resources include the following possibilities:

- /SM590000 Unused PUs or memory that is not enabled by LICCC
- /SM590000 Inactive resources that are enabled by LICCC (memory that is not being used by any activated LPARs)
- /SM590000 Memory that is purchased with the flexible memory option
- /SM590000 Extra drawers

The I/O connectivity also must support drawer removal. Most of the paths to the I/O feature redundant I/O interconnect support in the I/O infrastructure (drawers) that enable connections through multiple fan-out cards.

If sufficient resources are not present on the remaining drawers, specific noncritical LPARs might need to be deactivated. One or more PUs or storage might need to be configured offline to reach the required level of available resources. Plan to address these possibilities to help reduce operational errors.

Exception: Single-drawer systems cannot use the EDA procedure.

Include the planning process as part of the initial installation and any follow-on upgrade that modifies the operating environment. A customer can use the IBM Resource Link machine information report to determine the number of drawers, active PUs, memory configuration, and channel layout.

If the IBM z16 is installed, click Prepare for Enhanced Drawer Availability in the Perform Model Conversion window of the EDA process on the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA). This task helps you determine the resources that are required to support the removal of a drawer with acceptable degradation to the operating system images.



--- Chunk 10117 ---
 the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA). This task helps you determine the resources that are required to support the removal of a drawer with acceptable degradation to the operating system images.

The EDA process determines which resources (including memory, PUs, and I/O paths) are free to allow for the removal of a drawer. You can run this preparation on each drawer to determine which resource changes are necessary. Use the results as input in the planning stage to help identify critical resources.

With this planning information, you can examine the LPAR configuration and workload priorities to determine how resources might be reduced and still allow the drawer to be concurrently removed.

9.8.2  Enhanced drawer availability processing

To use the EDA, first ensure that the following conditions are met:

- /SM590000 The used processors (PUs) on the drawer that is removed are freed.
- /SM590000 The used memory on the drawer is freed.
- /SM590000 For all I/O domains that are connected to the drawer, ensure that alternative paths exist. Otherwise, place the I/O paths offline.

For the EDA process, this phase is the preparation phase. It is started from the SE, directly or on the HMA, by using the Single object operation option on the Perform Model Conversion window from the CPC configuration task list, as shown in Figure 9-7.

- /SM590000 PU definitions in the profiles that can be dedicated and dedicated reserved or shared
- /SM590000 Active LPARs with dedicated resources at the time of the drawer repair or replacement

To maximize the PU availability option, ensure that sufficient inactive physical resources are on the remaining drawers to complete a drawer removal.

Memory availability

Memory resource availability for reallocation or deactivation depends on the following factors:

- /SM590000 Physically installed memory
- /SM590000 Image profile memory allocations
- /SM590000 Amount of memory that is enabled through LICCC
- /SM590000 Flexible memory option

Preparing for enhanced drawer availability

The Prepare Concurrent Drawer replacement option validates that enough dormant resources are available for this operation. If enough resources are not available on the remaining drawers to complete the EDA process, the process identifies those resources. It then guides you through a series of steps to select and free up those resources. The preparation process does not complete until all processors, memory, and I/O conditions are successfully resolved.

Preparation: The preparation step does not reallocate any resources. It is used only to record customer choices and produce a configuration file on the SE that is used to run the concurrent drawer replacement operation.

The preparation step can be done in advance. However, if any changes to the configuration occur between the preparation and the physical removal of the drawer, you must rerun the preparation phase.

The process can be run multiple times because it does not move any resources. To view the results of the last preparation operation, click Display Previous Prepare Enhanced Drawer Availability Results from the Perform Model Conversion window in the SE.

The preparation step can be run without performing a drawer replacement. You can use it to dynamically adjust the operational configuration for drawer repair or replacement before IBM SSR activity.

The preparation step determines the readiness of the system for the removal of the targeted drawer. The configured processors and the memory in the selected drawer are evaluated against unused resources that are available across the remaining drawers. The system also analyzes I/O connections that are associated with the removal of the targeted drawer for any single path I/O connectivity.

If insufficient resources are available, the system identifies the conflicts so that you can free other resources.

The results of the preparation are presented for review in a tabbed format. Each tab indicates conditions that prevent the EDA option from being run. The following tab selections are available:

- /SM590000 Processors

Alternative Path I/O

Only the tabs that feature conditions that prevent the drawer from being removed are displayed. Each tab indicates the specific conditions and possible options to correct them.

For example, the preparation identifies single I/O paths that are associated with the removal of the selected drawer. These paths must be varied offline to perform the drawer removal. After you address the condition, rerun the preparation step to ensure that all the required conditions are met.

Important: Consider the results of these changes relative to the operational environment. Understand the potential effect of making such operational changes. Changes to the PU assignment, although technically correct, can result in constraints for critical system images. In specific cases, the solution might be to defer the reassignments to another time that has less effect on the production system images.

After you review the reassignment results and make any necessary adjustments, click OK (see Figure 9-10).

<!-- missing-text -->

Summary of the drawer removal process steps

To remove a drawer, the following resources must be moved to the remaining active drawers:

- /SM590000 PUs: Enough PUs must be available on the remaining active drawers, including all types of PUs that can be characterized (CPs, IFLs, ICFs, zIIPs, SAPs, and IFP).
- /SM590000 Memory: Enough installed memory must be available on the remaining active drawers.
- /SM590000 I/O connectivity: Alternative paths to other drawers must be available on the remaining active drawers, or the I/O path must be taken offline.

By understanding the system configuration and the LPAR allocation for memory, PUs, and I/O, you can make the best decision about how to free the necessary resources to allow for drawer removal.

Complete the following steps to concurrently replace a drawer:



--- Chunk 10332 ---
cation for memory, PUs, and I/O, you can make the best decision about how to free the necessary resources to allow for drawer removal.

Complete the following steps to concurrently replace a drawer:

- 1. Run the preparation task to determine the necessary resources.
- 2. Review the results.
- 3. Determine the actions to perform to meet the required conditions for EDA.
- 4. When you are ready to remove the drawer, free the resources that are indicated in the preparation steps.
- 5. Repeat the step that is shown in Figure 9-7 on page 397 to ensure that the required conditions are all satisfied.

Upon successful completion, the system is ready for the removal of the drawer.

The preparation process can be run multiple times to ensure that all conditions are met. It does not reallocate any resources; instead, it produces only a report. The resources are not reallocated until the Perform Drawer Removal process is started.

Rules during EDA

During EDA, the following rules are enforced:

resources; instead, it produces only a report. The resources are not reallocated until the Perform Drawer Removal process is started.

Rules during EDA

During EDA, the following rules are enforced:

- /SM590000 Processor rules

All processors in any remaining drawers are available to be used during EDA. This requirement includes the two spare PUs or any available PU that is non-LICCC.

The EDA process also allows conversion of one PU type to another PU type. One example is converting a zIIP to a CP during the EDA function. The preparation for the concurrent drawer replacement task indicates whether any SAPs must be moved to the remaining drawers.

- /SM590000 Memory rules

All physical memory that is installed in the system, including flexible memory, is available during the EDA function. Any physical installed memory, whether purchased or not, is available to be used by the EDA function.

- /SM590000 Single I/O rules



--- Chunk 10334 ---
, including flexible memory, is available during the EDA function. Any physical installed memory, whether purchased or not, is available to be used by the EDA function.

- /SM590000 Single I/O rules

Alternative paths to other drawers must be available, or the I/O path must be taken offline.

Review the results. The result of the preparation task is a list of resources that must be made available before the drawer replacement can occur.

Freeing any resources

At this stage, create a plan to free these resources. The following resources and actions are necessary to free them:

- /SM590000 Freeing any PUs:
- -Vary off the PUs by using the Perform a Model Conversion window, which reduces the number of PUs in the shared PU pool.
- -Deactivate the LPARs.
- /SM590000 Freeing memory:
- -Deactivate an LPAR.
- -Vary offline a portion of the reserved (online) memory. For example, in z/OS, run the following command:
- CONFIG\_STOR(E=1),&lt;OFFLINE/ONLINE&gt;



--- Chunk 10335 ---
SM590000 Freeing memory:
- -Deactivate an LPAR.
- -Vary offline a portion of the reserved (online) memory. For example, in z/OS, run the following command:
- CONFIG\_STOR(E=1),&lt;OFFLINE/ONLINE&gt;

This command enables a storage element to be taken offline. The size of the storage element depends on the RSU value. In z/OS, the following command configures offline smaller amounts of storage than the amount that was set for the storage element:

- CONFIG\_STOR(nnM),&lt;OFFLINE/ONLINE&gt;
- -A combination of both LPAR deactivation and varying memory offline.

Reserved storage: If you plan to use the EDA function with z/OS LPARs, set up reserved storage and an RSU value. Use the RSU value to specify the number of storage units that are to be kept free of long-term fixed storage allocations. This configuration allows for storage elements to be varied offline.

9.9  Concurrent Driver Maintenance

CDM is one more step toward reducing the necessity for and the duration of a scheduled outage. One of the components to planned outages is LIC Driver updates that are run in support of new features and functions.

When correctly configured, IBM z16 supports concurrently activating a selected new LIC Driver level. Concurrent activation of the selected new LIC Driver level is supported only at specific released sync points. Concurrently activating a selected new LIC Driver level anywhere in the maintenance stream is not possible. Specific LIC updates do not allow a concurrent update or upgrade.

9.9.1  Resource Group and native PCIe features MCLs

Microcode fixes, referred to as individual MCLs or packaged in bundles , might be required to update the Resource Group code and the native PCIe features. Although the goal is to minimize changes or make the update process concurrent, the maintenance updates at times can require the Resource Group or the affected native PCIe to be toggle d offline and online to implement the updates.

The native PCIe features (managed by Resource Group code) are listed Table 9-1.

- /SM590000 Updates to the Resource Group require all native PCIe adapters that are installed in that RG to be offline.
- /SM590000 Updates to the native PCIe adapter require the adapter to be offline. If the adapter is not defined, the MCL session automatically installs the maintenance that is related to the adapter.

The PCIe native adapters are configured with Function IDs (FIDs) and might need to be configured offline when changes to code are needed. To help alleviate the number of adapters (and FIDs) that are affected by the Resource Group code update, IBM z16 have four Resource Groups per system (CPC).

The front, rear, and top view of the PCIe+ I/O drawer and the Resource Group assignment by card slot are shown in Figure 9-11. All PCIe+ I/O drawers that are installed in the system feature the same Resource Group assignment.

Hardware Management Console and Support Element

The Hardware Management Console (HMC) supports the functions and tasks that are required to manage the IBM Z. When tasks are performed on the HMC, the commands are sent to the Primary Support Element (SE) of the targeted system, which then issues commands to their respective central processor complex (CPC).

This chapter describes the newest elements for the HMC and SE.

Tip: The Help function is a good starting point to get more information about all of the functions that can be used by the HMC and SE. The Help feature is available by clicking Help from the drop-down menu that appears when you click your user ID.

10.1  Introduction

The HMC is a closed system (appliance), which means that no other applications can be installed on it.

The HMC runs a set of management applications. On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA) feature FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. Stand-alone outside the IBM z16 HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) no longer can be ordered.

The following HMC feature codes can be carried forward from previous orders:

- /SM590000 FC 0062
- /SM590000 FC 0063
- /SM590000 FC 0082
- /SM590000 FC 0083

On the carry forward HMC features, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 must be installed to support IBM z16. Also, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed on the SE/HMC hardware that is provided with the HMA feature FC 0100 on IBM z15.

You can use the IBM z16 with carry forward HMCs and no initial order of FC 0129 (HMA for IBM z16). Order of the HMA FC 0129 is possible later as MES.

With IBM z16, the HMA feature shares the integrated 1U server hardware (installed on top of rack A with) the SE code. The SE code runs virtualized under the HMC on each of the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers. One SE is the Primary SE (active) and the other is the Alternative SE (backup). As with the HMCs, the SEs are closed systems (appliances), and no other applications can be installed on the same hardware.

E is the Primary SE (active) and the other is the Alternative SE (backup). As with the HMCs, the SEs are closed systems (appliances), and no other applications can be installed on the same hardware.

The HMC is used to set up, manage, monitor, and operate one or more IBM Z CPCs. It manages IBM Z hardware and its logical partitions (LPARs), and provides support applications. At least one HMC is required to operate an IBM Z. An HMC can manage multiple IBM Z CPCs.

When tasks are performed at the HMC, the commands are routed to the Primary SE of the IBM z16. The SE then issues those commands to their CPC.

Note: The new Driver level for HMC and SE for IBM z16 is Driver 51. Driver 51 is equivalent to Version 2.16.0.

With HMC and SE Driver 41/Version 2.15.0, several 'traditional' SE-only functions were moved to HMC tasks. On HMC and SE Driver 41/Version 2.15.0 and Driver 51/Version 2.16.0, these functions appear as native HMC tasks, but run on the SE. These HMC functions run in parallel with Single Object Operations (SOOs), which simplifies and streamlines system management.

- /SM590000 HMC/SE TLS 1.3 support

The HMC and SE support TLS 1.3. Before setting the TLS level to 1.3, you must ensure that all services and servers that are connecting by way of TLS to the HMC and SE support TLS 1.3 as well (for example, the remote browser, LDAP Authentication Servers, Web Services API connections, Fibre Channel End Point Security, and FTPS, Single Object Operations).

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not supported by Driver 51/Version 2.16.0.

If minimum TLS version is set to 1.2, TLS 1.3 is attempted first and then, falls back to TLS 1.2 if required.

- /SM590000 HMC/SE certification expiration updates

The new default for HMC and SE certificate expiration is 398 days and it can be modified. This expiration period is driven by an industry shorter certificate lifespan that is used by the Apple Safari browser and iOS.

A hardware message is posted for every expiration event 90, 30, and 7 days and 1 day before the expiry date is reached. If the expiration occurs, a hardware message is posted daily.

A Call Home to IBM also is placed 7 days and 1 day before the certificate expiration and daily afterward. These events also are recorded in the Audit Log and Resource Link.

It is the customer's responsibility to manage all certificates.

/SM590000 System Availability Data changes

Transmit System Availability Data (TSAD) contains important data for the client and IBM. For example, this task sends data to IBM Resource Link to have MCL and configuration information available. Also, Capacity on Demand (CoD) information is exchanged. IBM proactive monitors Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) data for potential actions or improvements for the system.

Users sometimes wanted to modify the execution time of this TSAD and accidentally deleted this TSAD Scheduled Operation.

With previous IBM Z generations, TSAD was scheduled in the Customize Scheduled Operation task for the HMC and the SE/CPC.

With IBM z16, this TSAD function moved to the Customize Console Services task, as shown in Figure 10-6.

By using the Configure Data Replication task, configuration data can be exchanged between linked HMCs; for example, the User Profile Data can be replicated.

An HMC can feature the following replication roles:

- -Primary

An HMC in the role of primary is a Data Replication source to other HMCs that are in the role of replica. A primary HMC can be only a source for Data Replication; it cannot receive replicated data from other HMCs.

- -Peer

An HMC in the role of peer is Data Replication source to other HMCs that are in the role of peer or replica. An HMC in this role receives replicated data from other HMCs that are in the role of peer or primary.

- -Replica

- /SM590000 Remote Code Load

The Remote Code Load (RCL) for IBM Z allows IBM to upgrade a machine remotely by working with the customer to schedule a date and time for the code load and monitor the process to ensure that it completes successfully.

This feature allows you to schedule one or multiple Single Step Code Loads for an HMC or SE.

On an IBM z16 system with the HMA feature, RCL can be scheduled to update both HMCs. The firmware automatically manages Alternative SE switches to ensure that each HMC can be updated without the Primary SE being present.

In general, you first must generate a token on the HMC task Manage Remote Firmware Updates. Then, you can schedule an RCL on IBM Resource Link by selecting Fixes → Licensed internal code → Remote Code Load request .

In rare cases after a microcode update, the Crypto and OSA adapters must be configured off/on to activate the loaded firmware. With IBM z16, a new function is available with which you can select one or more Crypto and OSA adapters and perform an automated serialized update of each card.

Important: Configuring the off/on operation is concurrent to the operating system activities only if the Crypto and OSA adapters are configured redundantly. The automated process does not perform the redundancy check for you. If you are unsure about adapter redundancy, we recommend toggling each adapter manually off/on.

With IBM z16, default users ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG no longer are preinstalled on the new shipped HMCs and SEs.

Default user roles for ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG are shipped and the corresponding user IDs can be created from those roles.

Any default user ID that was part of a previous HMC can be carried forward to the new HMCs as part of a MES upgrade or by using the tasks User Profile Data for the Save/Restore Customizable Console Data or Configure Data Replication.

At first log-on, the default password for the ACSADMIN and SERVICE user must be changed.

Note: Consider the following points:

Cs ( HMC1 and HMC2 ) from manufacturing (these names can be changed) are configured as independent HMCs. They are not Primary or Alternative HMCs. HMC Data Replication can be established, if wanted.

The SE code is running as a guest of the HMC. The two SE code instances are clustered for high availability. One SE code runs the Primary SE the other Alternative SE. These SEs perform data mirroring and their role can be switched for maintenance purposes.

Switching the Primary and Alternative SE roles is important because HMC microcode maintenance can be performed only on the server that runs the Alternative SE as a guest.

If the HMC, which receives microcode updates, runs the Primary SE guest, SE switchover must be performed. Figure 10-13 shows the HMA relation to the HMCs and SEs.

10.3.1  Hardware Management Appliance connectivity

On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the HMA FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the A frame. Stand-alone HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) can no longer be ordered.

With IBM z16 and HMA, the SE code runs virtualized on the two integrated HMCs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. One SE is the Primary SE (active) and the other is the Alternative SE (backup).

With the HMA, each HMC and each SE has its own two physical Ethernet RJ45 ports, as shown in Figure 10-17. The red lines highlights the Ethernet connectivity for the SEs; the green lines highlight the HMCs.

With these HMC feature codes, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed to support IBM z16.

You can use the IBM z16 with previously ordered HMCs and no HMA. It is possible to order the HMA FC 0129 later as MES.

The HMC communicates with the SE is through a customer-supplied Ethernet switch (two switches are recommended for redundancy).

HMC File Transfer support

FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols are supported on the HMC and SE. All three file transfer protocols require login ID and password credentials.

FTPS is based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocol and requires certificates to authenticate the servers. SFTP is based on Secure Shell protocol (SSH) and requires SSH keys to authenticate the servers. Certificates and key pairs are hosted on the IBM z16 HMC.

The following FTP server requirements must be met:

- /SM590000 Passive data connections are supported
- /SM590000 A server configuration is available that allows the client to connect on an ephemeral port

The following FTPS server requirements must be met:

- /SM590000 Operates in 'explicit' mode
- /SM590000 Allows a server to offer secure and unsecured connections
- /SM590000 Supports passive data connections
- /SM590000 Supports secure data connections

FTP through HMC

It is recommended to keep the HMCs and SEs on an isolated network. This approach prevents SEs from starting FTP connections with outside networks. It also applies to all supported file transfer protocols (FTP, FTPS, and SFTP).

All FTP connections that originate from the SE are taken to the HMC. Secure FTP server credentials must be imported to one or more managing HMC consoles.

After the HMC console completes all FTP operations, the HMC console performs the FTP operation on the SE's behalf and returns the results. The IBM Z platform must be managed by at least one HMC to allow FTP operations.

Secure console-to-console communications

The IBM z16 HMC features an industry standard-based, password-driven cryptography system. The Domain Security Settings are used to provide authentication and high-quality encryption. We recommend that clients use unique Domain Security settings to provide maximum security. These settings provide greater security than anonymous cipher suites, even if the default settings are used.

To allow greater flexibility in password selection, the password limit was increased to 64 characters and special characters are allowed for IBM z16.

Ethernet switches and hubs often include the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 A total of 16 auto-negotiation ports
- /SM590000 100/1000 Mbps data rate
- /SM590000 Full or half duplex operation

Note: It is recommendation an Ethernet switch with 1000 Mbps/Full duplex support is used.

10.3.5  TCP/IP Version 6 on the HMC and SE

The HMC and SE can communicate by using IPv4, IPv6, or both.

IPv6 link-local addresses feature the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 Every IPv6 network interface is assigned a link-local IP address.



--- Chunk 10589 ---
 and SE can communicate by using IPv4, IPv6, or both.

IPv6 link-local addresses feature the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 Every IPv6 network interface is assigned a link-local IP address.

- /SM590000 A link-local address is used on a single link (subnet) only and is never routed.
- /SM590000 Two IPv6-capable hosts on a subnet can communicate by using link-local addresses, without having any other IP addresses assigned. If HMC-to-SE IPv6 link-local is working, the SE/CPC appears in System Management → Unmanaged Systems on the HMC.

10.3.6  Assigning TCP/IP addresses to the HMC, SE and ETS

Use the worksheet in the Installation Manuals, GC28-7041 (A02), GC28-7036 (AGZ) under ' Hardware Management Appliance and Support Element customer configuration requirements ', and the HMC and SE Network Information Worksheet , GC28-7023, to plan your HMC, SE, and ETS IP configuration.

An HMC can have the following IP configurations:

- /SM590000 Statically assigned IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
- /SM590000 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)-assigned IPv4 or DHCP-assigned IPv6 addressees
- /SM590000 Auto-configured IPv6:
- -Link-local is assigned to every network interface.
- -Router-advertised, which is broadcast from the router, can be combined with a Media Access Control (MAC) address to create a unique address.
- -Privacy extensions can be enabled for these addresses as a way to avoid the use of the MAC address as part of the address to ensure uniqueness.

An SE can have the following IP addresses:

- /SM590000 Statically assigned IPv4 or statically assigned IPv6
- /SM590000 Auto-configured IPv6 as link-local or router-advertised



--- Chunk 10591 ---
o ensure uniqueness.

An SE can have the following IP addresses:

- /SM590000 Statically assigned IPv4 or statically assigned IPv6
- /SM590000 Auto-configured IPv6 as link-local or router-advertised

IP addresses on the SE cannot be dynamically assigned through DHCP to ensure repeatable address assignments. DHCP privacy extensions are not used on the SE.

The HMC uses IPv4 and IPv6 multi-casting 1  to automatically discover the SEs. The HMC Network Diagnostic Information task can be used to identify the IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), which are used by the HMC to communicate to the SEs (of a CPC).

IPv6 addresses are easily identified. A fully qualified IPV6 address features 16 bytes. It is written as eight 16-bit hexadecimal blocks that are separated by colons, as shown in the following example:

2001:0db8:0000:0000:0202:b3ff:fe1e:8329

2001:0db8:0000:0000:0202:b3ff:fe1e:8329

Because many IPv6 addresses are not fully qualified, shorthand notation can be used. In shorthand notation, the leading zeros can be omitted, and a series of consecutive zeros can be replaced with a double colon. The address in the previous example also can be written in the following manner:

2001:db8::202:b3ff:fe1e:8329

If an IPv6 address is assigned to the HMC for remote operations that use a web browser, browse to it by specifying that address. The address must be surrounded with square brackets in the browser's address field, as shown in the following example:

https://[fdab:1b89:fc07:1:201:6cff:fe72:ba7c]

The use of link-local addresses must be supported by your browser.

10.3.8  HMC multi-factor authentication

MFA is an optional and configurable feature on per-user, per-template basis. It enhances security by requiring what you know (the first factor) and what you have available, which means that only a person who owns a specific phone number can log in.

The MFA first factor is the combination of login ID and password; the second factor is TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) that is sent to your smartphone, desktop, or application (for example, Google Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password.



--- Chunk 10596 ---
oogle Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password.

The secret key is generated by HMC/SE/TKE while the user is performing first factor log-on. The secret key is known only to HMC/SE/TKE and to the user's device. For that reason, it must be protected as much as your first factor password.

MFA code that was generated as a second factor is time-sensitive. Therefore, it is important to remember that it must be used as soon as possible after it is generated.

The algorithm within the HMC that is responsible for MFA code generation changes the code every 30 seconds. However, to ease the process, the HMC and SE console accepts current, previous, and next MFA codes.



--- Chunk 10597 ---
ithm within the HMC that is responsible for MFA code generation changes the code every 30 seconds. However, to ease the process, the HMC and SE console accepts current, previous, and next MFA codes.

It is also important to have HMC, SE, and device clocks synchronized. If the clocks are not synchronized, the MFA log-on attempt fails. Time zone differences are irrelevant because the MFA code algorithm uses UTC.

On IBM z15, HMC Driver 41/Version 2.15.0 provides the integration of HMC authentication and z/OS MFA support. Therefore, RSA SecurID authentication is achieved by way of centralized support from IBM MFA for z/OS, with the MFA policy defined in RACF and the HMC IDs assigned to RACF user IDs. The RSA SecurID passcode (from an RSA SecurID Token) is verified by the RSA authentication server. This authentication is supported on HMC only, not on the SE.

bilities are remained the same. The figures and descriptions in this section cover only the traditional Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM) mode.

10.5.1  Central processor complex management

The HMC is the primary place for CPC control. For example, the input/output configuration data set (IOCDS) includes definitions of LPARs, channel subsystems, control units, and devices, and their accessibility from LPARs. IOCDS can be created and put into production from the HMC.

The HMC is used to start the power-on reset (POR) of the system. During the POR, processor units (PUs) are characterized and placed into their respective pools, memory is put into a single storage pool, and the IOCDS is loaded into and started in the hardware system area (HSA).

The hardware messages task displays hardware-related messages at the CPC, LPAR, or SE level. It also displays hardware messages that relate to the HMC.

e system area (HSA).

The hardware messages task displays hardware-related messages at the CPC, LPAR, or SE level. It also displays hardware messages that relate to the HMC.

10.5.2  LPAR management

Use the HMC to define LPAR properties, such as the number of processors of each type, how many are reserved, and how much memory is assigned to it. These parameters are defined in LPAR profiles and stored on the SE.

Because PR/SM must manage LPAR access to processors and the initial weights of each partition, weights are used to prioritize partition access to processors.

You can use the Load task on the HMC to perform an IPL of an operating system. This task causes a program to be read from a designated device, and starts that program. You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server.

 task causes a program to be read from a designated device, and starts that program. You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server.

When an LPAR is active and an operating system is running in it, you can use the HMC to dynamically change certain LPAR parameters. The HMC provides an interface to change partition weights, add logical processors to partitions, and add memory.

LPAR weights also can be changed through a scheduled operation. Use the Customize Scheduled Operations task to define the weights that are set to LPARs at the scheduled time.

Channel paths can be dynamically configured on and off (as needed for each partition) from an HMC.

The Change LPAR Controls task for IBM z16 can export the Change LPAR Controls table data to a comma-separated value (. csv )-formatted file. This support is available to a user when they are remotely connected to the HMC by a web browser.



--- Chunk 10607 ---
6 can export the Change LPAR Controls table data to a comma-separated value (. csv )-formatted file. This support is available to a user when they are remotely connected to the HMC by a web browser.

Partition capping values can be scheduled and are specified on the Change LPAR Controls scheduled operation support. Viewing more information about a Change LPAR Controls scheduled operation is available on the SE.

One example of managing the LPAR settings is the absolute physical hardware LPAR capacity setting. Driver 15 (zEC12/zBC12) introduced the capability to define (in the image profile for shared processors) the absolute processor capacity that the image is allowed to use (independent of the image weight or other cappings).



--- Chunk 10608 ---
introduced the capability to define (in the image profile for shared processors) the absolute processor capacity that the image is allowed to use (independent of the image weight or other cappings).

To indicate that the LPAR can use the nondedicated processors absolute capping, select Absolute capping on the Image Profile Processor settings to specify an absolute number of processors at which to cap the LPAR's activity. The absolute capping value can be 'None' or a value for the number of processors (0.01 - 255.0).

Following on to LPAR absolute capping, LPAR group absolute capping uses a similar method to enforce the following components:

- /SM590000 Customer licensing
- /SM590000 Non-z/OS partitions where group soft capping is not an option
- /SM590000 z/OS partitions where ISV does not support software capping

A group name, processor capping value, and partition membership are specified at the hardware console, along with the following properties:



--- Chunk 10609 ---
OS partitions where ISV does not support software capping

A group name, processor capping value, and partition membership are specified at the hardware console, along with the following properties:

- /SM590000 Use Change LPAR Group Controls (as with windows that are used for software group-defined capacity), as shown in Figure 10-22.

<!-- missing-text -->

Absolute capping is specified as an absolute number of processors to which the group's activity is capped. The value is specified to hundredths of a processor (for example, 4.56 processors) worth of capacity.

The value is not tied to the Licensed Internal Code (LIC) configuration code (LICCC). Any value 0.01 - 255.00 can be specified. This configuration makes the profiles more portable,

which means that you do not encounter problems when profiles are migrated to new machines.

Although the absolute cap can be specified to hundredths of a processor, the exact amount might not be that precise. The same factors that influence the 'machine capacity' also influence the precision with which the absolute capping works.

LPAR absolute capping can be changed through scheduled operations start.

10.5.4  Operating system communication

The Operating System Messages task displays messages from an LPAR. You also can enter operating system commands and interact with the system. This feature is especially valuable for entering Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC) commands.

The HMC also provides integrated 3270 and ASCII consoles. These consoles allow an operating system to be accessed without requiring other network or network devices, such as TCP/IP or control units.

Updates to x3270 support

The Configure 3270 Emulators task on the HMC and TKE consoles was enhanced with Driver 15 to verify the authenticity of the certificate that is returned by the 3270 server when a secure and encrypted SSL connection is established to an IBM host. This 3270 Emulator with encrypted connection is also known as Secure 3270 .



--- Chunk 10617 ---
 certificate that is returned by the 3270 server when a secure and encrypted SSL connection is established to an IBM host. This 3270 Emulator with encrypted connection is also known as Secure 3270 .

Use the Certificate Management feature if the certificates that are returned by the 3270 server are not signed by a well-known trusted certificate authority (CA) certificate, such as VeriSign or Geotrust. An advanced action within the Certificate Management task, Manage Trusted Signing Certificates, is used to add trusted signing certificates.

For example, if the certificate that is associated with the 3270 server on the IBM host is signed and issued by a corporate certificate, it must be imported, as shown in Figure 10-24.

10.5.8  Server Time Protocol support

Important: The Sysplex Time task on the SE was discontinued with IBM z15. Therefore, an HMC with Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 is required to access the Manage System Time task for IBM z16 A01, IBM z15 T01, and IBM z15 T02 CPCs.

IBM z16 implements the following major enhancements in support of the Server Time Protocol function:

- /SM590000 CPC direct Ethernet connectivity for the external time source (ETS)
- In previous generation IBM Z, the ETS for the STP was provided by connecting the Support element to the client network.

- In previous generation IBM Z, the ETS for the STP was provided by connecting the Support element to the client network.

With IBM z16 the ETS, PTP (IEEE 1588) or NTP network connectivity is provided by using the IBM z16 CPC oscillator (OSC) cards dedicated network ports (RJ45) to client LAN for accessing the time synchronization information.

Pulse-per-second connectivity also is provided for the highest timing information accuracy. Connection of the ETS direct to the IBM Z CPC provides less delay in accessing the time source that connection through the Support Element.

- /SM590000 n-mode Power STP Imminent Disruption Signal option

On IBM Z, losing a Preferred Time Server (PTS) has significant consequences to the timing network and the overall workload execution environment of the IBM Z sysplex. The IBM Z and the HMC feature longtime automated failover protection for various cases that can arise.

New for IBM z16 because an integrated battery facility no long is available, support was added by the HMC to allow the customer to configure an option to monitor for n-mode power conditions (wall power or power cord loss). If detected, an automated failover occurs to the Backup Time Server (BTS).

Note: Provide some backup power method to hold power for 60 seconds on the PTS to allow failover to successfully complete.

Manage System Time user interface controls are available to manage failback to the PTS when the full power state is restored.

ETS direct connectivity to the IBM z16 CPC is provided for both supported ETS protocols: NTP and PTP.

N-mode power sensing for STP recovery

For previous IBM Z server generations, specific configurations that use Bulk Power Adapter (BPA) with IBF can sense an 'operating on battery condition' if a power interruption occurs on any power cord.



--- Chunk 10789 ---
 previous IBM Z server generations, specific configurations that use Bulk Power Adapter (BPA) with IBF can sense an 'operating on battery condition' if a power interruption occurs on any power cord.

For STP, if CPC1 (Primary Time Server and Current Time Server) senses a shift to an on-battery power condition, a signal indicating potential imminent server disruption of CPC1 is sent to CPC2 (the Backup Time Server).

If within 30 seconds the BTS (CPC2) does not receive a signal that power is back to fully redundant on CPC1, CPC2 takes over as CTS. After normal power is restored to CPC1, CPC1 can automatically return to the CTS role.

With IBM z16, the IBF was discontinued. As such, Coupling Facility Nonvolatility requires Room-level, Row-level, or System-Level UPS for protecting against power failures.



--- Chunk 10790 ---
y return to the CTS role.

With IBM z16, the IBF was discontinued. As such, Coupling Facility Nonvolatility requires Room-level, Row-level, or System-Level UPS for protecting against power failures.

New STP PTS/BTS methods enable better coverage across both BPA and iPDU configurations for a much broader scope of clients that can take advantage of STP high-reliability functions. The new strategy allows clients with UPS to more effectively monitor and manage their power efficiency across their data center.

STP resiliency for PTS/CTS transition IBM Z from IBF Sensing to N-Mode Power Sensing.

To enable the N-Mode Power Sensing, a one-time setup step is required. In the HMC Manage System Time task, a customer enables the automatic switch over function from CPC1 to CPC2 for STP. After the function is enabled, the power subsystem (BPA and iPDU) detects any power source loss (at the power cord or power side level).



--- Chunk 10791 ---
the automatic switch over function from CPC1 to CPC2 for STP. After the function is enabled, the power subsystem (BPA and iPDU) detects any power source loss (at the power cord or power side level).

This detection generates a signal from CPC1 to CPC2 in the same way as done for systems with IBF. The generation of this signal can take up to 30 seconds, depending on conditions.

If within 30 seconds CPC2 does not receive a signal that power is back to fully redundant on CPC1, CPC2 takes over as CTS. After normal power is restored to CPC1, CPC1 can automatically return to the CTS role.

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery (ECAR) speeds up the process of BTS takeover by performing the following steps:



--- Chunk 10792 ---
CPC1 can automatically return to the CTS role.

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery (ECAR) speeds up the process of BTS takeover by performing the following steps:

- 1. When the PTS/CTS detects a checkstop condition, the CEC informs its SE and HMC.
- 2. The PTS SE recognizes the checkstop pending condition, and calls the PTS SE STP code.
- 3. The PTS SE sends an ECAR request thorough HMC to the BTS SE.
- 4. The BTS SE communicates with the BTS to start the takeover.

ECAR support is faster than the original CAR support because the console path changes from a 2-way path to a 1-way path. Also, almost no lag time is incurred between the system checkstop and the start of CAR processing. Because the request is generated from the PTS before system logging, it avoids the potential of recovery being held up.

Attention: IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 ZR1 do not support InfiniBand connectivity. Although IBM z14 M0x supports InfiniBand, InfiniBand coupling and timing links cannot be configured in a Syspex/CTN with IBM z16.

CTN split

The HMC menus for Server Time Protocol (STP) provide support when one or more systems must be split in to a separate CTN without interruption in the clock source.

The task is available under the Advanced Actions menu in the Manage System Time task. Several checks are performed to avoid potential disruptive actions. If targeted CTN includes only members with the roles, the task start fails with an error message.

If targeted CTN includes at least one system without any roles, the task starts. An informational warning is presented to the user to acknowledge that sysplex workloads are divided suitably.

Merging two CTNs

When two separate CTNs must be merged in to the single CTN without interruption in the clock source, the system administrator must perform the Join existing CTN action, which is available in the Advanced Actions menu.

TNs must be merged in to the single CTN without interruption in the clock source, the system administrator must perform the Join existing CTN action, which is available in the Advanced Actions menu.

Note: After joining the selected CTN, all systems within the current CTN are synchronized with the Current Time Server of the selected CTN. A coupling link must be in place that connects the CTS of the selected CTN and the CTS of the current CTN.

During the transition state, most of the STP actions for the two affected CTNs are disabled. After the merge is completed, STP actions are enabled again.

10.5.10  NTP client and server support on the HMC

The NTP client support allows a STP-only CTN to use an NTP server as an ETS. This capability addresses the following requirements:

- /SM590000 Customers who want time synchronization for the servers members of the STP-only CTN
- /SM590000 Customers who use a common time reference across heterogeneous systems

The NTP server becomes the single time source (the ETS) for STP and other servers that are not IBM Z (such as AIXfi and Microsoft Windows) that include NTP clients.

nce across heterogeneous systems

The NTP server becomes the single time source (the ETS) for STP and other servers that are not IBM Z (such as AIXfi and Microsoft Windows) that include NTP clients.

The HMC can act as an NTP server. With this support, the IBM z15 can receive the time from the HMC without accessing a LAN other than the HMC and SE network. When the HMC is used as an NTP server, it can be configured to receive the NTP source from the internet. For this type of configuration, a LAN that is separate from the HMC/SE LAN can be used.

Note: For IBM z16, STP External Time Source (Ethernet) is connected directly to the CPC drawer by using a dedicated LAN port. When HMC is configured as an NTP server, it must be connected to the same client network with the dedicated CPC LAN port.

HMC NTP broadband authentication support

HMC NTP authentication can be used since HMC Driver 15 (zEC12/zBC12).

HMC NTP broadband authentication support

HMC NTP authentication can be used since HMC Driver 15 (zEC12/zBC12).

Authentication support with a proxy

Some client configurations use a proxy for external access outside the corporate data center. NTP requests are User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket packets and cannot pass through the proxy. The proxy must be configured as an NTP server to get to target servers on the web. Authentication can be set up on the client's proxy to communicate with the target time sources.

Authentication support with a firewall

If you use a firewall, HMC NTP requests can pass through it. Use HMC authentication to ensure untampered timestamps.

NTP symmetric key and autokey authentication

With symmetric key and autokey authentication, the highest level of NTP security is available. HMC Level 2.12.0 and later provide windows that accept and generate key information to be configured into the HMC NTP configuration. They also can issue NTP commands.

The HMC offers the following symmetric key and autokey authentication and NTP commands:

- /SM590000 Symmetric key (NTP V3-V4) authentication
- Symmetric key authentication is described in RFC 1305, which was made available in NTP Version 3. Symmetric key encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Users that are exchanging data keep this key to themselves.

Messages that are encrypted with a secret key can be decrypted only with the same secret key. Symmetric key authentication supports network address translation (NAT).

- /SM590000 Symmetric key autokey (NTP V4) authentication

This autokey uses public key cryptography, as described in RFC 5906, which was made available in NTP Version 4. You can generate keys for the HMC NTP by clicking Generate Local Host Key in the Autokey Configuration window. This option issues the ntp-keygen command to generate the specific key and certificate for this system. Autokey authentication is not available with the NAT firewall.

- /SM590000 Issue NTP commands

This section addresses security and user ID management considerations.

HMC and SE HD encryption

Consider the following points about IBM z16 (with continued emphasis on encryption):

- /SM590000 Passwords are never stored in clear (one-way hash)
- /SM590000 HMC/SE is a closed appliance; no means exist to get HDD
- /SM590000 All network traffic is TLS encrypted
- /SM590000 HMC and SE feature embedded firewall
- /SM590000 Firmware is digitally signed and validated for delivery
- /SM590000 Firmware Integrity Monitoring is used for any attempted tempering post delivery

For HMC and SE Driver 51/Version 2.16.0, HDD encryption uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) technology.

HMC and SE security audit improvements

The Monitor System Events task allows Security Logs to send email notifications by using the same type of filters and rules that are used for hardware and operating system messages.

With IBM z16, you can offload the following HMC and SE log files for customer audit:

- /SM590000 Console event log
- /SM590000 Console service history
- /SM590000 Tasks performed log
- /SM590000 Security logs
- /SM590000 System log

Full log offload and delta log offload (since the last offload request) are provided. Offloading to removable media and to remote locations by FTP is available. The offloading can be manually started by the new Audit and Log Management task or scheduled by the Customize Scheduled Operations task. The data can be offloaded in the HTML and XML formats.

HMC user ID templates and LDAP user authentication

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) user authentication and HMC user ID templates enable the addition and removal of HMC users according to your own corporate security environment. These processes use an LDAP server as the central authority.

Each HMC user ID template defines the specific authorization levels for the tasks and objects for the user who is mapped to that template. The HMC user is mapped to a specific user ID template by user ID pattern matching. The system then obtains the name of the user ID template from content in the LDAP server schema data.

Default HMC user IDs

For HMC V2.16.0 the default user IDs are limited to ACSADMIN and SERVICE.



--- Chunk 10805 ---
The system then obtains the name of the user ID template from content in the LDAP server schema data.

Default HMC user IDs

For HMC V2.16.0 the default user IDs are limited to ACSADMIN and SERVICE.

ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG default users are no longer shipped. Default user roles for ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG are provided, and user IDs can be created from those roles.

Any default user IDs that are part of a previous HMC level can be carried forward to new HMC levels as part of a MES Upgrade or by way of selecting User Profile Data for the Save/Restore Customizable Console Data or Configure Data Replication tasks.

HMC and SE secure FTP support

You can use a secure FTP connection from a HMC/SE FTP client to a customer FTP server location. This configuration is implemented by using the Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol, which is an extension of SSH. You can use the Manage SSH Keys console feature that is available to the HMC and SE to import public keys that are associated with a host address.

The Secure FTP infrastructure allows HMC and SE applications to query whether a public key is associated with a host address and to use the Secure FTP interface with the suitable public key for a host. Tasks that use FTP now provide a selection for the secure host connection.

10.5.12  System Input/Output Configuration Analyzer on the SE and HMC

The System Input/Output Configuration Analyzer supports the system I/O configuration function.

The information that is needed to manage a system's I/O configuration must be obtained from many separate sources. The System Input/Output Configuration Analyzer task enables the system hardware administrator to access, from one location, the information from those sources. Managing I/O configurations then becomes easier, particularly across multiple systems.

The System Input/Output Configuration Analyzer runs the following functions:

- /SM590000 Analyzes the current active IOCDS on the SE.
- /SM590000 Extracts information about the defined channel, partitions, link addresses, and control units.
- /SM590000 Requests the channels' node ID information. The Fibre Channel connection (FICON) channels support remote node ID information, which is also collected.

- /SM590000 Requests the channels' node ID information. The Fibre Channel connection (FICON) channels support remote node ID information, which is also collected.

The System Input/Output Configuration Analyzer is a view-only tool. It does not offer any options other than viewing. The tool provides various sort options, and data can be exported to a UFD for later viewing.

By using the tool, data is formatted and displayed in the following views:

- /SM590000 PCHID Control Unit View
- Shows PCHIDs, channel subsystems (CSS), CHPIDs, and their control units.

10.5.13  Automated operations

As an alternative to manual operations, an application can interact with the HMC and SE through an API. The interface allows a program to monitor and control the hardware components of the system in the same way a user performs these tasks.

On IBM z16, the HMC APIs provide monitoring and control functions through SNMP. The API can get and set a managed object's attributes, issue commands, receive asynchronous notifications, and generate SNMP traps.

The older system, such as IBM z13's HMC, supports the CIM as an extra systems management API. Starting with IBM z14, the CIM support is removed.

For more information about APIs, see SNMP Application Programming Interfaces , SB10-7179.

This section describes the cryptographic management and control functions that are available in the HMC and SE.

Cryptographic hardware

IBM z16 systems include standard cryptographic hardware and optional cryptographic features for flexibility and growth capability.

The HMC/SE interface provides the following capabilities:

- /SM590000 Defining the cryptographic controls
- /SM590000 Dynamically adding a Crypto feature to a partition:
- -For the first time
- -That already uses Crypto

The Crypto Express8S, which is a new Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cryptographic coprocessor, is an optional IBM z16 exclusive feature. Crypto Express8S provides a secure programming and hardware environment on which crypto processes are run.

Each Crypto Express8S adapter can be configured by the installation as a Secure IBM CCA coprocessor, a Secure IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 (EP11) coprocessor, or an accelerator.

When EP11 mode is selected, a unique Enterprise PKCS #11 firmware is loaded into the cryptographic coprocessor. It is separate from the Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) firmware that is loaded when a CCA coprocessor is selected. CCA firmware and PKCS #11 firmware cannot coexist in a card.

The Trusted Key Entry (TKE) Workstation with smart card reader feature is required to support the administration of the Crypto Express8S when configured as an Enterprise PKCS #11 coprocessor.

The TKE10.0 is needed to support the new Crypto Express8S card. An example of the Cryptographic Configuration window is shown in Figure 10-32.

Digitally signed firmware

Security and data integrity are critical issues with firmware upgrades. Procedures are in place to use a process to digitally sign the firmware update files that are sent to the HMC, SE, and TKE. By using a hash algorithm, a message digest is generated that is then encrypted with a private key to produce a digital signature.

This operation ensures that any changes that are made to the data are detected during the upgrade process by verifying the digital signature. It helps ensure that no malware can be installed on IBM Z products during firmware updates. It also enables the IBM z16 Central Processor Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF) functions to comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3 Level 1 planned for Cryptographic LIC changes. The enhancement follows the IBM Z focus of security for the HMC and the SE.

The Crypto Express8S (CEX8S) is compliant with CCA PCI HSM. TKE workstation is optional when used to manage a Crypto Express8S feature that is defined as a CCA coprocessor in normal mode.

The Crypto Express8S (CEX8S) is compliant with CCA PCI HSM. TKE workstation is optional when used to manage a Crypto Express8S feature that is defined as a CCA coprocessor in normal mode.

However, it is mandatory when it is used to manage a Crypto Express8S feature that is defined as a CCA coprocessor in PCI-HSM mode or is defined as an EP11 coprocessor (CCA in PCI-HSM mode and EP11 also require a smart card reader plus smart cards with FIPS certification).

10.5.15  Installation support for z/VM that uses the HMC

Starting with z/VM V5R4 and z10, Linux on IBM Z can be installed in a z/VM virtual machine from HMC workstation media. This Linux on IBM Z installation can use the communication path between the HMC and the SE. No external network or extra network setup is necessary for the installation.

DPM is an administrative mode (front end to PR/SM) that was introduced for Linux-only systems for IBM z13 and following systems. With DPM, you can use your Linux and virtualization skills while taking advantage of the full value of IBM Z hardware, robustness, and security in a workload optimized environment.

A system can be configured in DPM mode or in PR/SM mode (POR is required to switch modes). In general, DPM supports the following functions:

- /SM590000 Create, provision, and manage partitions (processor, memory, and adapters) and storage
- /SM590000 Monitor and troubleshoot the environment

The following LPAR modes are available for DPM:

- /SM590000 z/VM
- /SM590000 Linux on IBM Z (also used for KVM deployments)
- /SM590000 Secure Service Container



--- Chunk 10818 ---

The following LPAR modes are available for DPM:

- /SM590000 z/VM
- /SM590000 Linux on IBM Z (also used for KVM deployments)
- /SM590000 Secure Service Container

If DPM is enabled, the IBM z16 system cannot run z/OS, IBM z/VSE, and z/TPF LPARs.

The IBM z16 can be initialized in PR/SM mode or in DPM mode, but not both.

DPM provides a GUI for PR/SM (to manage resources). Tools, such as HCD are in DPM mode and are not necessary.

This IBM Redbooks publication does not cover scenarios that use DPM.

For more information about the use of DPM, see IBM Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) Guide , SB10-7182.

Important: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 The Enabling DPM function is run on the SE and is performed by your IBM system Service Representative at installation time.

11.2  Power and cooling

The IBM z16 server can be a 1 - 4 19-inch rack system, depending on the configuration. Frames are shipped separately in Arbo crates, along with separate front and rear cover sets for each frame boxed on a shipping pallet. The frames are bolted together during the installation procedure.

IBM z16 servers support installation on a raised floor or nonraised floor and are available in the following power and cooling options:

- /SM590000 Intelligent Power Distribution Unit-based power (iPDU) or PDU
- /SM590000 Bulk Power Assembly-based power (BPA)

All IBM z16 models include radiator-based cooling (air cooled system).

11.2.1  Intelligent Power Distribution Unit

The iPDUs can be ordered as the following feature codes (FCs), per customer data center power infrastructure requirements:

- /SM590000 60A/3-Phase 'Delta' PDU FC 0645
- /SM590000 32A/3-Phase 'Wye' PDU FC 0646

A PDU-based system can have 2 - 8 power cords, depending on the configuration. The use of iPDU on IBM z16 might enable fewer frames, which allows for more I/O slots to be available and improves power efficiency to lower overall energy costs. It also offers some standardization and ease of data center installation planning, which allows the IBM z16 to easily coexist with other platforms within the data center.

Power requirements

the IBM z16 is designed with a fully redundant power system. To make full use of the redundancy that is built into the server, the PDUs within one pair must be powered from different power distribution panels. In that case, if one PDU in a pair fails, the second PDU ensures continued operation of the server without interruption.

The second, third, and fourth PDU pairs are installed dependent on other CPC or PCIe+ I/O drawers installed. The locations of the PDU pairs and frames are listed in Table 11-1.

Removal of IBF support : IBM z16 cannot be configured with an internal battery feature (IBM). Extra support for data center power planning can be requested through your IBM Sales contact.

The BPA option is required for customers who order an Internal Battery Feature (IBF), Water Cooling Unit (WCU), or Balanced Power. The BPA requires two or four power cords. All BPAs are concurrently repairable in the field.

Power requirements

The 3931 operates from 2 or 4 fully redundant power supplies. These redundant power supplies each have their own power cords, or pair of power cords, which allows the system to survive the loss of customer power to either power cord or power cord pair.

If power is interrupted to one of the power supplies, the other power supply assumes the entire load and the system continues to operate without interruption. Therefore, the power cords for each power supply must be wired to support the entire power load of the system.



--- Chunk 10828 ---
upply assumes the entire load and the system continues to operate without interruption. Therefore, the power cords for each power supply must be wired to support the entire power load of the system.

For the most reliable availability, the power cords in the rear of the frame should be powered from different PDUs. All power cords exit through the rear of the frame. The utility current distribution across the phase conductors (phase current balance) depends on the system configuration. Each front-end power supply is provided with phase switching redundancy.

The loss of an input phase is detected and the total input current is switched to the remaining phase pair without any power interruption. Depending on the configuration input power draw, the system can run from several minutes to indefinitely in this condition. Because most single phase losses are transients that recover in seconds, this redundancy provides protection against virtually all single phase outages.

11.2.3  Cooling requirements

The IBM z16 cooling system is manufactured as a radiator (air) cooled system. The dual chip modules (DCMs) are cooled with an internal water loop. The liquid in the internal water circuit is cooled by using a radiator. I/O drawers, PCIe I/O drawers, power enclosures, and CPC drawers are cooled by chilled air with blowers.

The IBM z16 servers include a recommended (long-term) ambient temperature range of 18°C (64.4°F) - 27°C (80.6°F). The minimum allowed ambient temperature is 5°C (41°F); the maximum allowed temperature is 40°C (104°F).

12.1  IBM z16 performance characteristics

The IBM z16 Model A01 Feature Max200 (7K0) is designed to offer up to 17% more capacity compared to an IBM z15 Model T01 (7H0) system.

Uniprocessor performance also increased. On average, an IBM z16 model 701 offers performance improvements almost 10% over the IBM z15 Model 701. Figure 12-1 shows a system performance comparison of successive IBM Z servers.

These numbers differ depending on the workload type and LPAR configuration.

12.1.2  IBM z16 SMT capacity

From z13 to IBM z16, customers can choose to run two threads on IFL and zIIP cores by using SMT mode. SMT increases throughput by 10 - 40% (average 25%), depending on workload.

For zIIPs and IFLs, the performance improvement per SMT enabled core for z16 (3931) versus z15 (8561) is approximately 11%, which is the same improvement for zIIPs and IFLs in a single thread.

r zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC)

Starting with z13, IBM introduced the zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) Express PCIe feature, which increases efficiency for data storing and data transfers.

The zEDC Express feature was adopted by enterprises because it helps with software costs for compression and decompression operations (by offloading these operations), and increases data encryption (compression before encryption) efficiency.

With IBM z15, the zEDC Express functions were moved off from the PCIe infrastructure into the processor chip. By moving the compression and decompression into the processor on-chip, IBM z15 processor provides a new level of performance for these tasks and eliminates the need for the zEDC Express feature virtualization. It also brings new use cases to the platform.

12.2  IBM z16 Large System Performance Reference ratio

The Large System Performance Reference (LSPR) provides capacity ratios among various processor families that are based on various measured workloads. It is a common practice to assign a capacity scaling value to processors as a high-level approximation of their capacities.

For z/OS studies, the capacity scaling factor that is commonly associated with the reference processor is set to a 2094-701 with a Processor Capacity Index (PCI) value of 593. This value is unchanged since z/OS V1R11 LSPR. The use of the same scaling factor across LSPR releases minimizes the changes in capacity results for an older study and provides more accurate capacity view for a new study.



--- Chunk 10855 ---
 since z/OS V1R11 LSPR. The use of the same scaling factor across LSPR releases minimizes the changes in capacity results for an older study and provides more accurate capacity view for a new study.

Performance data for IBM z16 servers were obtained with z/OS V2R4 (running Db2 for z/OS V12, CICS TS V5R3, IMS V14, Enterprise COBOL V6R2, and WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V9.0.0.8). All IBM Z server generations are measured in the same environment with the same workloads at high usage.

Note: If your software configuration is different from what is described here, the performance results might vary.

On average, IBM z16 servers can deliver up to 17% more performance in a 200-way configuration than an IBM z15 190 -way. However, the observed performance increase varies depending on the workload type.

average, IBM z16 servers can deliver up to 17% more performance in a 200-way configuration than an IBM z15 190 -way. However, the observed performance increase varies depending on the workload type.

Consult the LSPR when you consider performance on the IBM z16. The range of performance ratings across the individual LSPR workloads is likely to include a large spread. Performance of the individual logical partitions (LPARs) varies depending on the fluctuating resource requirements of other partitions and the availability of processor units (PUs). Therefore, it is important to know which LSPR workload type suite your production environment. For more information, see 12.8, 'Workload performance variation' on page 483.

12.2.1  LSPR workload suite

Historically, LSPR capacity tables, including pure workloads and mixes, were identified with application names or a software characteristic; for example, CICS, IMS, OLTP-T, 1 CB-L, 2 LoIO-mix, 3 and TI-mix. 4  However, capacity performance is more closely associated with how a workload uses and interacts with a specific processor hardware design.

The CPU Measurement Facility (CPU MF) data that was introduced on the z10 provides insight into the interaction of workload and hardware design in production workloads. CPU MF data helps LSPR to adjust workload capacity curves that are based on the underlying hardware sensitivities; in particular, the processor access to caches and memory.

 in production workloads. CPU MF data helps LSPR to adjust workload capacity curves that are based on the underlying hardware sensitivities; in particular, the processor access to caches and memory.

This processor access to caches and memory is called Relative Nest Intensity (for more information, see 12.4, 'Relative Nest Intensity' on page 479). By using this data, LSPR introduces three workload capacity categories that replace all older primitives and mixes.

LSPR contains the internal throughput rate ratios (ITRRs) for the IBM z16 and the previous generation processor families. These ratios are based on measurements and projections that use standard IBM benchmarks in a controlled environment.

te ratios (ITRRs) for the IBM z16 and the previous generation processor families. These ratios are based on measurements and projections that use standard IBM benchmarks in a controlled environment.

Note: The throughput that any user experiences can vary depending on the amount of multiprogramming in the user's job stream, the I/O configuration, and the workload that is processed. Therefore, no assurance can be given that an individual user can achieve throughput improvements that are equivalent to the performance ratios that are stated.

12.3  Fundamental components of workload performance

Workload performance is sensitive to the following major factors:

- /SM590000 Instruction path length
- /SM590000 Instruction complexity
- /SM590000 Memory hierarchy and memory nest

These factors are described next.

12.3.1  Instruction path length



--- Chunk 10860 ---
ajor factors:

- /SM590000 Instruction path length
- /SM590000 Instruction complexity
- /SM590000 Memory hierarchy and memory nest

These factors are described next.

12.3.1  Instruction path length

A transaction or job runs a set of instructions to complete its task. These instructions are composed of various paths through the operating system, subsystems, and application. The total count of instructions that are run across these software components is referred to as the transaction or job path length .

The path length varies for each transaction or job, and depends on the complexity of the tasks that must be run. For a specific transaction or job, the application path length tends to stay the same, assuming that the transaction or job is asked to run the same task each time.

However, the path length that is associated with the operating system or subsystem can vary based on the following factors:



--- Chunk 10861 ---
ming that the transaction or job is asked to run the same task each time.

However, the path length that is associated with the operating system or subsystem can vary based on the following factors:

- /SM590000 Competition with other tasks in the system for shared resources. As the total number of tasks grows, more instructions are needed to manage the resources.
- /SM590000 The number of logical processors ( n-way ) of the image or LPAR. As the number of logical processors grows, more instructions are needed to manage resources that are serialized by latches and locks.

12.3.2  Instruction complexity

The type of instructions and the sequence in which they are run interacts with the design of a microprocessor to affect a performance component. This factor is defined as instruction complexity . The following design alternatives affect this component:

- /SM590000 Superscalar
- /SM590000 Out-of-order execution

- /SM590000 Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)
- /SM590000 Transactional Execution (TX)

- /SM590000 Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) 5

12.3.3  Memory hierarchy and memory nest



--- Chunk 10863 ---
roprocessors with various designs, performance varies. However, when on a processor, this component tends to be similar across all models of that processor.

12.3.3  Memory hierarchy and memory nest

The memory hierarchy of a processor generally refers to the caches, data buses, and memory arrays that stage the instructions and data that must be run on the microprocessor to complete a transaction or job.

The following design choices affect this component:

- /SM590000 Cache size
- /SM590000 Latencies (sensitive to distance from the microprocessor)
- /SM590000 Number of levels, the Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid (MESI) protocol, controllers, switches, the number and bandwidth of data buses, and so on.

With IBM z16, physical L3/L4 caches no longer exist. L2 caches that are on each processor core are virtual L3/L4 caches on IBM z16. For more information, see Chapter 3, 'Central processor complex design' on page 67.

A memory nest in an IBM z16 CPC drawer is shown in Figure 12-2.

Workload performance is sensitive to how deep into the memory hierarchy the processor must go to retrieve the workload instructions and data for running. The best performance occurs when the instructions and data are in the caches that are nearest the processor because little time is spent waiting before running. If the instructions and data must be retrieved from farther out in the hierarchy, the processor spends more time waiting for their arrival.



--- Chunk 10865 ---
essor because little time is spent waiting before running. If the instructions and data must be retrieved from farther out in the hierarchy, the processor spends more time waiting for their arrival.

As workloads are moved between processors with various memory hierarchy designs, performance varies because the average time to retrieve instructions and data from within the memory hierarchy varies. Also, when on a processor, this component continues to vary because the location of a workload's instructions and data within the memory hierarchy is affected by several factors that include, but are not limited to, the following factors:

- /SM590000 Locality of reference
- /SM590000 I/O rate
- /SM590000 Competition from other applications and LPARs

12.4  Relative Nest Intensity

The most performance-sensitive area of the memory hierarchy is the activity to the memory nest. This area is the distribution of activity to the shared caches and memory.



--- Chunk 10866 ---
4  Relative Nest Intensity

The most performance-sensitive area of the memory hierarchy is the activity to the memory nest. This area is the distribution of activity to the shared caches and memory.

The term Relative Nest Intensity (RNI) indicates the level of activity to this part of the memory hierarchy. By using data from CPU MF, the RNI of the workload that is running in an LPAR can be calculated. The higher the RNI, the deeper into the memory hierarchy the processor must go to retrieve the instructions and data for that workload.

RNI reflects the distribution and latency of sourcing data from shared caches and memory, as shown in Figure 12-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

Many factors influence the performance of a workload. However, these factors often are influencing the RNI of the workload. The interaction of all these factors results in a net RNI for the workload, which in turn directly relates to the performance of the workload.



--- Chunk 10867 ---
 factors often are influencing the RNI of the workload. The interaction of all these factors results in a net RNI for the workload, which in turn directly relates to the performance of the workload.

These factors are tendencies, not absolutes. For example, a workload might have a low I/O rate, intensive processor use, and a high locality of reference, which all suggest a low RNI. However, it might be competing with many other applications within the same LPAR and many other LPARs on the processor, which tends to create a higher RNI. It is the net effect of the interaction of all these factors that determines the RNI.

The traditional factors that were used to categorize workloads in the past are shown with their RNI tendency in Figure 12-4.

The traditional factors that were used to categorize workloads in the past are shown with their RNI tendency in Figure 12-4.

Little can be done to affect most of these factors. An application type is whatever is necessary to do the job. The data reference pattern and processor usage tend to be inherent to the nature of the application. The LPAR configuration and application mix are mostly a function of what must be supported on a system. The I/O rate can be influenced somewhat through buffer pool tuning.

However, one factor, software configuration tuning , is often overlooked but can have a direct effect on RNI. This term refers to the number of address spaces (such as CICS application-owning regions [AORs] or batch initiators) that are needed to support a workload.



--- Chunk 10869 ---
oked but can have a direct effect on RNI. This term refers to the number of address spaces (such as CICS application-owning regions [AORs] or batch initiators) that are needed to support a workload.

This factor always existed, but its sensitivity is higher with the current high frequency microprocessors. Spreading the same workload over more address spaces than necessary can raise a workload's RNI. This increase occurs because the working set of instructions and data from each address space increases the competition for the processor caches.



--- Chunk 10870 ---
ss spaces than necessary can raise a workload's RNI. This increase occurs because the working set of instructions and data from each address space increases the competition for the processor caches.

Tuning to reduce the number of simultaneously active address spaces to the optimum number that is needed to support a workload can reduce RNI and improve performance. In the LSPR, the number of address spaces for each processor type and n-way configuration is tuned to be consistent with what is needed to support the workload. Therefore, the LSPR workload capacity ratios reflect a presumed level of software configuration tuning. Retuning the software configuration of a production workload as it moves to a larger or faster processor might be needed to achieve the published LSPR ratios.

12.5  LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI



--- Chunk 10871 ---
oftware configuration of a production workload as it moves to a larger or faster processor might be needed to achieve the published LSPR ratios.

12.5  LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI

A workload's L1MP (Level 1 Miss Per 100 instructions or percentage of data and instruction references that miss the L1 cache) and RNI are the most influential factors in determining workload performance. Other more traditional factors, such as application type or I/O rate, include RNI tendencies. However, it is the L1MP and the net RNI of the workload that is the underlying factor in determining the workload's performance.

The LSPR now runs various combinations of former workload primitives, such as CICS, Db2, IMS, OSAM, VSAM, WebSphere, COBOL, and utilities, to produce capacity curves that span the typical range of RNI.

The following workload categories are represented in the LSPR tables:

- /SM590000 LOW (relative nest intensity)

COBOL, and utilities, to produce capacity curves that span the typical range of RNI.

The following workload categories are represented in the LSPR tables:

- /SM590000 LOW (relative nest intensity)

A workload category that represents light use of the memory hierarchy.

- /SM590000 AVERAGE (relative nest intensity)

A workload category that represents average use of the memory hierarchy. This category is expected to represent most production workloads.

- /SM590000 HIGH (relative nest intensity)

A workload category that represents a heavy use of the memory hierarchy.

These categories are based on the L1MP and the RNI. The RNI is influenced by many variables, such as application type, I/O rate, application mix, processor usage, data reference patterns, LPAR configuration, and the software configuration that is running. CPU MF data can be collected by z/OS System Measurement Facility on SMF 113 records or by z/VM Monitor starting with z/VM V5R4.

12.6  Relating production workloads to LSPR workloads

Historically, the following techniques were used to match production workloads to LSPR workloads:

- /SM590000 Application name (a client that is running CICS can use the CICS LSPR workload)
- /SM590000 Application type (create a mix of the LSPR online and batch workloads)
- /SM590000 I/O rate (the low I/O rates that are used a mix of low I/O rate LSPR workloads)

The IBM z Processor Capacity Reference (IBM zPCR) tool supports the following workload categories:

- /SM590000 Low
- /SM590000 Low-Average
- /SM590000 Average
- /SM590000 Average-high
- /SM590000 High



--- Chunk 10874 ---

- /SM590000 Low-Average

- /SM590000 Average-high
- /SM590000 High

For more information about the no-charge IBM zPCR tool (which reflects the latest IBM LSPR measurements), see the Getting Started with IBM z Processor Capacity Reference.

As described in 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481, the underlying performance sensitive factor is how a workload interacts with the processor hardware.

12.7  CPU MF counter data and LSPR workload type

Beginning with the z10 processor, the hardware characteristics can be measured by using CPU MF (SMF 113) counters data. A production workload can be matched to an LSPR workload category through these hardware characteristics.

For more information about RNI, see 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481.



--- Chunk 10875 ---
 workload can be matched to an LSPR workload category through these hardware characteristics.

For more information about RNI, see 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481.

The AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload is intended to match most client workloads. When no other data is available, use the AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload for capacity analysis.

Low-Average and Average-High categories allow better granularity for workload characterization but these categories can apply on IBM zPCR only.

The CPU MF data can be used determine workload type. When available, this data allows the RNI for a production workload to be calculated.



--- Chunk 10876 ---
terization but these categories can apply on IBM zPCR only.

The CPU MF data can be used determine workload type. When available, this data allows the RNI for a production workload to be calculated.

By using the RNI and another factor from CPU MF, the L1MP   (Level 1 Miss Per 100 instructions or percentage of data and instruction references that miss the L1 cache), a workload can be classified as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH RNI. This classification and resulting hit are automated in the IBM zPCR tool. It is preferable to use IBM zPCR for capacity sizing.

Refer to Table 12-1 for the LSPR Workload Decision Table, based in L1MP and RNI.

Starting with z/OS V2R1 with APAR OA43366, zFS file is no longer required for CPU MF and Hardware Instrumentation Services (HIS). HIS is a z/OS function that collects hardware event data for processors in SMF records type 113, and a z/OS UNIX System Services output files.

Only SMF 113 record is required to know proper workload type by using CPU MF counter data. CPU overhead of CPUMF is minimal. Also, the amount of SMF 113 record is 1% of typical SMF 70 and 72 which RMF writes.

CPU MF and HIS can by used for deciding workload type and other purposes. For example, starting with z/OS V2R1, you can record Instruction Counts in SMF type 30 record when you activate CPU MF. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you always activate CPU MF.

12.8  Workload performance variation

As the size of transistors approaches the size of atoms that stand as a fundamental physical barrier, a processor chip's performance can no longer double every two years (Moore's Law 6 does not apply).

A holistic performance approach is required when the performance gains are reduced because of frequency. Therefore, hardware and software synergy becomes an absolute requirement.

6 does not apply).

A holistic performance approach is required when the performance gains are reduced because of frequency. Therefore, hardware and software synergy becomes an absolute requirement.

Starting with z13, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) improvements in core and cache became the driving factor for performance gains. As these microarchitectural features increase (which contributes to instruction parallelism), overall workload performance variability also increases because not all workloads react the same way to these enhancements.

Because of the nature of the IBM z16 multi-CPC drawer system and resource management across those drawers, performance variability from application to application is expected.



--- Chunk 10880 ---
o these enhancements.

Because of the nature of the IBM z16 multi-CPC drawer system and resource management across those drawers, performance variability from application to application is expected.

Also, the memory and cache designs affect various workloads in many ways. All workloads are improved, with cache-intensive loads benefiting the most. For example, having more PUs per CPC drawer, each with higher capacity than IBM z15, more workload can fit on an IBM z16 CPC drawer. This configuration can result in better performance. For example, IBM z15 two drawer system model T01 can populate maximum 71 PUs (Max71).

In contrast, IBM z16 two drawer system Max82 can populate maximum 82 PUs. Therefore, five and six more PUs can share caches and memories within the first and second drawers respectively, so the performance improvements is expected.



--- Chunk 10881 ---
ystem Max82 can populate maximum 82 PUs. Therefore, five and six more PUs can share caches and memories within the first and second drawers respectively, so the performance improvements is expected.

The workload variability for moving from IBM z14 and IBM z15 to IBM z16 is expected to be stable. Workloads that are migrating from z10 EC, z196, and zEC12 to IBM z16 can expect to see similar results with slightly less variability than the migration from IBM z14 and IBM z15.

Experience demonstrates that IBM Z servers can be run at up to sustained 100% utilization levels. However, most customers prefer to leave some room and run at 90% or slightly under.

12.9  Capacity planning considerations for IBM z16

In this section, we describe recommended ways conduct capacity planning for IBM z16.

Do not use MIPS or MSUs for capacity planning: Do not use 'one number' capacity comparisons, such as MIPS or MSUs. IBM does not officially announce the processor performance as 'MIPS'. MSU is only a number for software license charge and it does not represent the processor's performance.

12.9.1  Collect CPU MF counter data

It is important to recognize the LSPR workload type of your production system. As described in 12.7, 'CPU MF counter data and LSPR workload type' on page 482, the capacity of the processor is different from the LSPR workload type. By collecting the CPU MF z/OS SMF 113 record, you can recognize the workload type in a specific IBM-provided capacity planning tool. Therefore, collecting CPU MF counter data is a first step to begin the capacity planning.

12.9.2  Creating EDF files with CP3KEXTR

An EDF file is an input file of the IBM Z capacity planning tools. You create this file for individual z/OS SYSIDs / LPARs by using the CP3KEXTR program. The CP3KEXTR program reads SMF records and extracts needed data as input to the IBM z Processor Capacity Reference (IBM zPCR) and IBM Z Batch Network Analyzer (IBM zBNA) tools.

Note: You should create an EDF file for each z/OS SYSID and load all the EDFs for the same CPC into IBM zPCR at the same time so to ensure that the correct LSPR Workload is assigned to each LPAR.  IBM zPCR supports using drag-n-drop for multiple EDF files.



--- Chunk 10884 ---
d load all the EDFs for the same CPC into IBM zPCR at the same time so to ensure that the correct LSPR Workload is assigned to each LPAR.  IBM zPCR supports using drag-n-drop for multiple EDF files.

CP3KEXTR is offered as a no-charge application. It can also create the EDF files for IBMzCP3000. IBM zCP3000 is an IBM internal tool, but you can create the EDF files for it on your system.

For more information about CP3KEXTR, see the IBM Techdoc z/OS Data Extraction Program (CP3KEXTR) for IBM zPCR and IBM zBNA .

Creating EDF file with CP3KVMXT (z/VM)

CP3KVMXT is the VM Extract Utility for IBM zCP3000 and IBM zPCR Capacity Planning Support Tools. CP3KVMXT reads CP Monitor data from a z/VM system, and generates an Enterprise Data File (EDF) of PR/SM, system image, and workload-related measurements for input into the IBM zCP3000 and IBM zPCR capacity planning tools. A CP3KVMXT-created EDF can be used to model interactive VM workloads or workloads under guest operating systems such as Linux and can be concurrently loaded with a CP3KEXTR-created z/OS EDF for the same data intervals.

Note: You should create an EDF file for each z/VM system and load all the EDFs for the same CPC into IBM zPCR at the same time so to ensure that the correct LSPR Workload is assigned to each LPAR. IBM zPCR supports using drag-n-drop for multiple EDF files.

12.9.3  Loading EDF files to the capacity planning tool

By loading EDF files to IBM capacity planning tool, you can see the LSPR workload type that is based on CPU MF counter data.

Figure 12-5 on page 486 shows a sample IBM zPCR window of a workload type. In this example, the workload type displays in the 'Assigned Workload' column. The example shows only one partition, PX11, selected. Note that all active partitions can be selected on this panel. When you load the EDF file to IBM zPCR, it automatically sets your LPAR configuration. It also makes easy to define the LPAR configuration to the IBM zPCR.

12.9.8  IBM zPCR Large Partition Support

IBM zPCR version 9.6.4 8  implemented an important change to the LPAR Configuration Capacity Planning function. For the IBM z16, 3931 (Max200/700) a change was made to match the way RCPs per drawer are assigned when the total number RCPs in the configuration is up to 191. This change compensates for the way the RCP count per drawer actually occurs.



--- Chunk 11101 ---
nge was made to match the way RCPs per drawer are assigned when the total number RCPs in the configuration is up to 191. This change compensates for the way the RCP count per drawer actually occurs.

This change was needed since it turns out that not all IBM z16 Max200's have 51 configurable PU drawers. Some Max200's have 48 PU drawers when there are 191 or less PU's in the configuration.

IBM zPCR shows the distribution of PUs per drawer according to the Table 12-2, and there are very useful graphs called Estimated Distribution of RCPs Across Drawers that are available as an option from the Partition Detail Report, which identifies the number of PUs on each drawer.

See Figure 12-13 on page 495 and Figure 12-15 on page 497 for details about the new available graphs.

Resources are allocated as shown in the Partition Identification and Partition Configuration fields.

Partition Detail Report warnings

IBM zPCR implemented a warning indicating that on IBM z13 and later, the best performance is achieved when the partition's logical CP count does not exceed the number of RCPs in a single drawer.

Additionally, IBM zPCR version 9.6.4 implemented a new notice for partitions approaching, within 10%, the maximum drawer size. This critical notice indicates that one or more partitions partition are getting close to a drawer boundary. When that happens, capacity growth by adding LCPs is very limited.

The new notice appears as a 'Note' message in the Partition Detail Report. The 'Note' and the partition LCPs are shaded with the same violet color, as shown for partition IFL-01 in Figure 12-12 above and for partition GP-02 in Figure 12-14 on page 496.

Resources are allocated as shown in the Partition Identification and Partition Configuration fields.

As the IBM z16 (Figure 12-14 on page 496) has 165 CPs, the PU resources are distributed according to the Table 12-2 on page 493, and are shown in the Estimated Distribution of RCPs Across Drawers graph in Figure 12-15 on page 497.

IBM z16 continues the IBM z14 and IBM z15 NUMA 9  design. IBM z16 has two clusters and four DCMs per drawer (refer to Table 12-2 on page 493 for the number of Configurable PUs per drawer). In the case where a single partition spans from one drawer into a second, the cross-drawer penalty has increased on IBM z16. However, this is offset by more cores per drawer and higher capacity than IBM z15, which allows more work to 'fit' on a single drawer.



--- Chunk 11106 ---
to a second, the cross-drawer penalty has increased on IBM z16. However, this is offset by more cores per drawer and higher capacity than IBM z15, which allows more work to 'fit' on a single drawer.

As discussed in 3.5.9, 'Processor unit assignment' on page 110, and under 'Memory allocation' on page 113, PR/SM memory and logical processor allocation goal is to place all logical partition resources on a single CPC drawer, if possible. There can be negative impacts on a logical partition's performance when CPs are allocated in different drawers.

IBM zPCR implements a warning notice when logical partition's number of Logical CPs defined is larger than the number of Real CPs in a single drawer. When that scenario occurs, it is advisable to contact IBM to review your configuration. See Figure 12-16 on page 498.

This appendix provides a short overview of the new IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for Artificial Intelligence that is implemented in the IBM z16 processor (Telum).

Overview

Each generation of the IBM Z processing chip was enhanced with new on-chip functions, such as compression, sort, cryptography, and vector processing. The purpose-built accelerators that provide these functions mean lower latency and higher throughput for specialized operations. These accelerators work together with advanced chip design features such as data prefetch, high capacity L1 and L2 caches, branch prediction, and other innovations.

The on-chip accelerators provide support for and enable compliance with security policies because the data is not leaving the platform to be processed. The hardware, firmware, and software are vertically integrated to seamlessly deliver this function to the applications.

AI accelerator delivers AI inference in real time, at large scale and rate, with no transaction left behind without the need to offload data off the IBM Z for performing AI inference.

The AI capability is applied directly into the running transaction, shifting the traditional paradigm of applying AI to the transactions that were completed. This innovative technology can be used for intelligent IT workloads placement algorithms, which contributes to the better overall system performance. The co-processor is driven by the new Neural Networks Processing Assist (NNPA) instruction.

Acknowledging the diverse AI training frameworks, customers can train their models on platforms of their choice, including IBM Z (on-premises and in hybrid cloud) and then, deploy it efficiently on IBM Z in colocation with the transactional workloads. No other development effort is needed to enable this strategy.

amount of data that is captured, transferred, and stored continues to grow. Software-based compression algorithms can be costly in terms of processor resources, storage costs, and network bandwidth.

An optional PCIe feature that was available for IBM z14 servers, zEDC Express, addressed customer requirements by providing hardware-based acceleration for data compression and decompression. zEDC provided data compression with lower CPU consumption than compression technology that was available on the IBM Z server.

Customers deployed zEDC compression to deliver the following types of compression:

- /SM590000 Storage
- /SM590000 Data transfer
- /SM590000 Database
- /SM590000 In-application

Data compression delivers the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Disk space savings
- /SM590000 Improved elapse times
- /SM590000 Reduced CPU consumption
- /SM590000 Reduced network bandwidth requirements and transfer times



--- Chunk 11119 ---
rs the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Disk space savings
- /SM590000 Improved elapse times
- /SM590000 Reduced CPU consumption
- /SM590000 Reduced network bandwidth requirements and transfer times

Many customers increased their zEDC footprint to 8 GBps with up to 16 features per IBM z14 system at 1 GBps throughput per feature (redundancy reduces total throughput to 8 GBps).

Although the zEDC PCIe feature provided CPU savings by offloading the select compression and decompression operations, it included the drawback of limited virtualization capabilities (one zEDC PCIe feature can be shared across a maximum of 15 LPARs) and limited bandwidth.

IBM z15 introduced an on-chip accelerator (implemented in the PU chip) for compression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor's L3 cache. As a result, it provided much higher bandwidth and removed the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature.

pression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor's L3 cache. As a result, it provided much higher bandwidth and removed the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature.

The IBM z16 further addresses the growth of data compression requirements with the integrated on-chip compression unit (implemented in processor Nest, one per PU chip) that significantly increases compression throughput and speed compared to previous zEDC deployments.

IBM z16 IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC

IBM z16 on-chip compression provides value for existing and new compression users by bringing the compression facility into the PU chip, which is tied in L3 1  cache.

IBM z16 compression and decompression are implemented in the Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU, see Figure 3-15 on page 91) on each processor chip and replaces the existing zEDC Express adapter in the PCIe+ I/O drawer.

One NXU is available per processor chip, which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits:

- /SM590000 New concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest
- /SM590000 Supports DEFLATE-compliant compression and decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler
- /SM590000 Low latency
- /SM590000 High bandwidth

On-Chip Compression provides an up to 5% improvement in compression ratios for BSAM/VSAM data sets over zEDC while maintaining full compatibility.

Eliminating adapter sharing by using Nest Compression Accelerator

Sharing of zEDC cards is limited to 15 LPAR guests per adapter. The Nest Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processor chip and therefore is available to all LPARs and guests.

Moving the compression function from the (PCIe) I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations.

Compression modes

Compression is run in one of the following modes:

- /SM590000 Synchronous



--- Chunk 11123 ---
mpression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations.

Compression modes

Compression is run in one of the following modes:

- /SM590000 Synchronous

Execution occurs in problem state where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space.

- /SM590000 Asynchronous

Execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution.

This type of execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for authorized users of zEDC.

Note: The zEDC Express feature does not carry forward to IBM z16.

IBM z16 migration considerations

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC is fully compatible with zEDC. Data that is compressed by zEDC can be read by IBM z16 (the on-chip) NXU and vice versa.

All z/OS configurations stay the same

No changes are required when moving from earlier systems by using zEDC to IBM z16.

The IFAPRDxx feature is still required for authorized services. For problem state services, such as zlib use of Java, it is not required.

Consider fail-over and disaster recovery sizing

The order of magnitude throughput increase on IBM z16 means that the throughput requirements need to be considered whether failing over to earlier systems with zEDC.

Software support

On-Chip Compression function is compatible with zEDC support and is available in z/OS V2R2 and later for data compression and decompression. Although support for data recovery (decompression) if zEDC or On-Chip Compression not available, it is provided through software in z/OS V2R2 with the appropriate program temporary fixes (PTFs).

Software decompression is slow and can involve considerable processor resources. Therefore, it is not recommended for production environments.

IBM 31-bit and 64-bit SDK for z/OS Java Technology Edition, Version 7 Release 1 (5655-W43 and 5655-W44) and IBM SDK 7 for z/OS Java provides the use of the zEDC Express feature and Shared Memory Communications-Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R), which is used by the 10 GbE RoCE Express feature.

zBNA is based on Microsoft Windows. It provides graphical and text reports, including Gantt charts, and support for alternative processors.

zBNA can be used to analyze client-provided System Management Facilities (SMF) records to identify jobs and data sets that are candidates for zEDC and IBM z16 On-Chip Compression across a specified time window (often a batch window).

zBNA can generate lists of data sets by the following jobs:

- /SM590000 Jobs that perform hardware compression and might be candidates for On-Chip Compression.
- /SM590000 Jobs that might be On-Chip Compression candidates, but are not in extended format.

Compression acceleration and Linux on IBM Z

The zEDC I/O adapter use is limited in many Linux on IBM Z environments because SR-IOV does not provide a high degree of virtualization; therefore, the user must pick and choose which guests are granted access to the accelerator.

The IBM z16 On-Chip Compression accelerator solves these virtualization limitations because the function is no longer an I/O device and is available as a problem state instruction to all Linux on IBM Z guests without constraints.

This feature enables pervasive usage in highly virtualized environments.

Tailored Fit Pricing

Note: For more information about Tailored Fit Pricing, see this IBM Z Resources web page.

The information that is included in this section about TFP is taken in part from the IBM publication Tailored Fit Pricing - A sensible pricing model , 75034875USEN-01.

IBM Z platform users were used to paying for IBM Z software and hardware for peak capacity and managing their software costs by capping machine usage. Traditionally, they capped machine use by using the following methods:

re used to paying for IBM Z software and hardware for peak capacity and managing their software costs by capping machine usage. Traditionally, they capped machine use by using the following methods:

- /SM590000 Running batch workloads during off-shift hours
- /SM590000 Reducing machine resources access to development and test
- /SM590000 Not introducing new workloads or applications onto the platform, even when it was the most logical technology for such workloads
- /SM590000 Investing in tools and resources to manage subcapacity capping

These approaches, while effective in predictable workload management, created a mind-set that stifles innovation and limits the ability for businesses to use the full value of Z technology, especially now as they adapt for digital transformation and the journey to hybrid cloud.

mind-set that stifles innovation and limits the ability for businesses to use the full value of Z technology, especially now as they adapt for digital transformation and the journey to hybrid cloud.

IBM introduced Tailored Fit Pricing (originally for IBM Z software) as a simpler pricing model to allow Z customers to better use their platform investments as their business demands, and in a more cost competitive way. Building on the success of this program, a variable IBM Z hardware model was introduced to extend the value of Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z.

With Tailored Fit Pricing models now available across hardware and software, customers can gain more flexibility and control with pricing solutions that can be tailored for business demands, which helps to balance costs while deriving even more value from hybrid cloud.

The software and hardware pricing models provide customers an opportunity to grow and more fully use their IBM Z investment for new opportunities.

IBM originally introduced DevTest Solution and New Application Solution in 2017. These solutions further evolved when in May 2019, IBM announced two significant other solutions: Enterprise Consumption (since renamed to the Software Consumption Solution), and Enterprise Capacity Solution.

In May 2021, IBM announced a new hardware solution, called Hardware Consumption Solution. All of these options were gathered into a new family of IBM Z pricing called Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP).

The Software Consumption Solution and the Hardware Consumption Solution are discussed next.

To meet the demands of modern workloads and provide a commercial confidence to match the technology confidence, the Consumption Solution was well received and adopted.

Customers typically transition onto TFP Consumption for the following reasons:

- /SM590000 It is a software pricing model that is better suited to today's workloads profiles (typically, where they are increasingly spiky). Also, it is a pricing model that is better suited to future uses; for example, inclusion in Hybrid Cloud architectures.
- /SM590000 A customer on TFP Consumption can confidently remove all forms of capping and expose all their workloads to all of the hardware infrastructure they own.
- /SM590000 Any form of growth (from a new workload to a 30-year-old COBOL application that is used more often) qualifies for a much-improved Price per MSU.

- /SM590000 Any form of growth (from a new workload to a 30-year-old COBOL application that is used more often) qualifies for a much-improved Price per MSU.

One key concept in a Software Consumption Model is the customer baseline. The IBM team works with the customer to review their previous 12 months production MSU consumption and billing to determine an effective price per MSU and establish a predictable price for all growth at discounted rate (see Figure D-1).

<!-- missing-text -->

With the Software Consumption model, no concept of peaks or white space is used that previously were integral to the sub-capacity-based model. Therefore, customers are free to remove capping and can use all of the owned capacity without worrying about penalties for peaking or spiking.

eviously were integral to the sub-capacity-based model. Therefore, customers are free to remove capping and can use all of the owned capacity without worrying about penalties for peaking or spiking.

Although a customer does commit to an MSU baseline, if the MSUs for a specific year are not fully used, the customer can carry over any unused MSUs for use in the following year for the life of the contract. TFP consumption encourages and rewards growth; that is, MSUs that are processed above the baseline are charged at an aggressive Growth Price per MSU.

All workload processing can benefit by running with no capping and having all owned infrastructure available. Batch processing also can take advantage and reduce batch windows dramatically.

er MSU.

All workload processing can benefit by running with no capping and having all owned infrastructure available. Batch processing also can take advantage and reduce batch windows dramatically.

Without capping in place, customers can expect jobs to finish faster yet at the same cost. Online processing can process more transactions simultaneously, which improves response times. This result is a function of the new billing approach that is based on the amount of work that is done rather than peaks that are reached.

To provide improved economics for growth, TFP Consumption customers pay preferential pricing on the MSUs that are used above their baseline, regardless of whether that growth came from existing or new workloads. No other approval, qualification, or processing is required to use the growth pricing rate.

IBM Z enterprise customers often have One Time Charge (OTC) IBM products that are running in the same environment as MLC products. With the Software Consumption Model, IBM offers two choices for the handling of OTC software: A Full Capacity licensing model, and the option to use their existing OTC software licensing in a consumption model with the flexibility to use the entitlement on a consumption basis across a year as business demands.

Hardware Consumption Model

IBM introduced a hardware solution that provides added flexibility to the IBM Z IT infrastructure pricing and is a natural and valuable extension to the Tailored Fit Pricing models for IBM Z software.

To meet the demands of modern workloads, IBM Z hardware can now include, in addition to the base capacity, a subscription-based corridor of pay for use capacity. This always on corridor of consumption-priced capacity helps alleviate the effect of short unpredictable spikes in workload that are becoming more common in today's digital world.

The use charges feature a granularity of 1 hour and are based on MSUs that are used as measured by the subcapacity reporting Tool (SCRT), not full engine capacity.

Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z hardware enables customers to be ready for the unknown and unexpected. The presence of the always on capacity contributes to better efficiency, reduced overhead, and shorter response times. This offering is available for customers, starting with IBM z15, z/OS general-purpose CPs, and who are using Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z software.

Tailored Fit Pricing for IBM Z hardware in more detail

Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP)-Hardware pricing includes two aspects: a Subscription charge, and a Usage charge (see Figure D-2).

ed Fit Pricing for IBM Z hardware in more detail

Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP)-Hardware pricing includes two aspects: a Subscription charge, and a Usage charge (see Figure D-2).

<!-- missing-text -->

One of the most important facts about TFP-Hardware is that a single system or central processing complex (CPC) always is considered. It is on this level that use is measured. The blue bars that are shown in Figure D-2 represent individual 15-minute intervals, and the use is measured in each one.

In Figure D-2, the dark green line shows the average use of the machine over the entire period that is measure (normally a month). The black line shows the Rolling 4 Hour Average (R4HA), and it is displayed for information purposes only because the R4HA is not used for TFP-Hardware calculations.

The red line is the customer owned capacity (or Base capacity). The light green line shows the activated capacity of the machine, as reported by Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT).



--- Chunk 11168 ---
re calculations.

The red line is the customer owned capacity (or Base capacity). The light green line shows the activated capacity of the machine, as reported by Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT).

As shown in Figure D-2, some of the blue bars reach above the red line, into the corridor between the red line and light green lines, which represents the TFP-Hardware capacity. Therefore, use over the customer's owned (Purchased) capacity is measured, so a Usage charge is incurred. If no use is measured over the customer's owned (Purchased) capacity, no Usage charge is incurred.

In addition to the Usage charge, which might not be relevant, a Subscription charge also can be assessed. The Subscription charge is a flat, per system, per month payment that is based on the amount of TFP-Hardware capacity that is provided on the system. The Subscription charge is invoiced prepaid for the contract term or postpaid monthly.

 system, per month payment that is based on the amount of TFP-Hardware capacity that is provided on the system. The Subscription charge is invoiced prepaid for the contract term or postpaid monthly.

Because only entire engines can be activated, it is always full engine sizes that are based on IBM Large System Performance Reference (LSPR) capacity levels. The Subscription charge covers the value that the extra activated capacity brings, even if no measured usage exists (see Figure D-3).

<!-- missing-text -->

The green bar in Figure D-3 represents the capacity that the customer owns (the so-called Base capacity ). The transparent bars represent activated TFP-Hardware corridor.

The blue bars show the measured usage within the 15-minute intervals that are greater than the customer-owned capacity. The yellow bar is the highest measured TFP-Hardware use within the defined hour.



--- Chunk 11170 ---
e blue bars show the measured usage within the 15-minute intervals that are greater than the customer-owned capacity. The yellow bar is the highest measured TFP-Hardware use within the defined hour.

The red bar in Figure D-3 is the highest measured use during a calendar day and is only relevant if the customer has more than 4 hours of TFP-Hardware use within one calendar day.

The left column that represents one calendar day shows that 10 spikes above the Base capacity were measured. The spikes that are counted for invoicing are the yellow bars (the highest within each hour).

The yellow bars hold a measured million of service units (MSU) value. If the total MSU use of the yellow bars is 250 MSU, the customer receives an invoice of 250 times the hourly usage charge per MSU.

e yellow bars hold a measured million of service units (MSU) value. If the total MSU use of the yellow bars is 250 MSU, the customer receives an invoice of 250 times the hourly usage charge per MSU.

Also, the right column in Figure D-3 represents one calendar day, where 18 spikes above the Base capacity are measured. The spike that is counted for invoicing is the red bar (the highest within the calendar day). The red bar is considered because it was measured that the TFP-Hardware corridor was used for more than 4 hours during the calendar day.

The red bar also holds a measured MSU value for that calendar day. If the total MSU use of the red bar is 100 MSU, the customer receives an invoice of 100 times the daily usage charge per MSU.

Conclusion

The combination of TFP for the hardware and software is a powerful one for our customers to maximize their investment in IBM Z. For eligible customers, it allows them to use their hardware for their general capacity requirements with a consumption-based corridor on top.

When this TFP for hardware is combined with the TFP-SW solutions, it allows customers to unleash the full power of their IBM Z machine.

IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency

Resiliency continues to be a hot topic for clients and a key value driver for IBM Z, especially for the largest IBM Z clients in regulated industries.

IBM's answer was the introduction of zDR Cloud. This offering enables active MIPS flexibility between the production site and the DR site. It also offers greater flexibility over CBU tests for length of test execution and frequency.

However, the following disadvantages must be addressed:

- /SM590000 zDR Cloud requires an MES to run a site swap for test and CBU for unplanned site swap
- /SM590000 Onsite IBM intervention is required, which is not COVID-safe
- /SM590000 A 2-week lead time is required to implement, which induces delays
- /SM590000 it is applicable only to planned site swap scenarios; therefore, DR testing and real DR scenarios are not the same, which causes compliance issues
- /SM590000 A lack of standardization makes automation impossible

le only to planned site swap scenarios; therefore, DR testing and real DR scenarios are not the same, which causes compliance issues
- /SM590000 A lack of standardization makes automation impossible

To overcome these issues, IBM developed the new IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency offering.

Flexible Capacity is designed to provide increased flexibility and control to shift production workloads between participating IBM z16 machines at different sites and stay for up to one year.

It helps organizations shift capacity between participating IBM z16 machines at different sites to improve Cyber Resiliency and offers increased flexibility to shift capacity on demand between participating IBM z16 machines at different sites.

By using IBM GDPS, scripts can be run to fully automate Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency capacity shifts between participating IBM z16 machines at different sites.

It helps organizations to comply with evolving regulatory mandates by running a realistic failover scenario for production workloads that can also demonstrate business continuity.

Use cases of IBM Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency

In this section, we present several IBM Flexibly Capacity use cases for Cyber Resiliency.

How does IBM Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency work?

This section describes the high-level process for implementing IBM Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency.

Set up process

Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is facilitated through a new type of Temporary Capacity record.



--- Chunk 11178 ---
igh-level process for implementing IBM Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency.

Set up process

Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency is facilitated through a new type of Temporary Capacity record.

In the first step of the setup process (see Figure D-4), the active capacity of the participating IBM z16 machines is changed to a base machine plus the temporary entitlement record (TER) up to the High Water Mark (HWM) of the machine. The base capacity is defined by the customer. The machines' HWM remains unchanged.

<!-- missing-text -->

In the next step (see Figure D-5), the now unassigned capacity is restored with a new Flexible Capacity record. Another Flexible Capacity record is installed on System B to increase the capacity to the amount of MIPS that the customer licensed.

tored with a new Flexible Capacity record. Another Flexible Capacity record is installed on System B to increase the capacity to the amount of MIPS that the customer licensed.

<!-- missing-text -->

The IBM Flex Capacity record on System A then is activated until the machine's HWM. On System B, the Flexible Capacity record is installed, but not activated. The setup process is now complete (see Figure D-6).

<!-- missing-text -->

Transferring capacity

After the set up is complete, it is possible to transfer capacity and workload from Site A to Site B. This process can be automated by using GDPS technology.

GCP (general-purpose processor) capacity is transferred by using licensed MIPS. However, you cannot activate half a CP. Therefore, it is the customer's responsibility to stay under the licensed amount of MIPS; otherwise, extra charges are incurred for the use that is greater than the licensed MIPS.



--- Chunk 11180 ---
ctivate half a CP. Therefore, it is the customer's responsibility to stay under the licensed amount of MIPS; otherwise, extra charges are incurred for the use that is greater than the licensed MIPS.

After the Flexible Capacity record is active on both sites, a time limit of 24 hours begins in which workloads can be transferred from Site A to Site B without leading to more charges.

During this time window, Flexible Capacity can remain active on both sites, as shown in Figure D-7

<!-- missing-text -->

After 24 hours, the Flexible Capacity in Site A is removed and System A is reduced to base capacity (see Figure D-8).

Flexible Capacity on System B can stay running for up to one year.

Multi-system environment

A two-site, two-system environment is only the base infrastructure. Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency also is suited for complex multi-system environments.

Multi-system environment

A two-site, two-system environment is only the base infrastructure. Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency also is suited for complex multi-system environments.

Flexible Capacity from several systems can be transferred to single systems in Site B or vice-versa (see Figure D-9).

<!-- missing-text -->

Movement of capacity does not need to be 'all to one': the capacity also can be split.

However, the total capacity that is active on all systems after the swap cannot exceed the total capacity that is active before the swap.

Flexibly Capacity is available on all engine types; exceeding the purchased capacity incurs charged. Monitoring to ensure compliance is done by way of Call Home data that IBM receives periodically.

Tailored fit pricing for hardware and IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency

IBM Z Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency can be used with TFP-Hardware. The Flexible Capacity limit is always based on the Base capacity. The presence or activation of TFP-Hardware does not affect the amount of capacity that can be activated by a Flexible Capacity Transfer record.

The Flexible Capacity Transfer record always is considered to be the first record that was activated, regardless of the order in which temporary records or TFP-Hardware were activated.

The example that is shown in Figure D-10 shows an active Sysplex across Site A and Site B.

 regardless of the order in which temporary records or TFP-Hardware were activated.

The example that is shown in Figure D-10 shows an active Sysplex across Site A and Site B.

<!-- missing-text -->

System A has a Base capacity of 401 and the Flexible Capacity Record is partially activated up to a 710. On top of the active Flexible Capacity sits a TFP-Hardware capacity of two extra CPs to a maximum of 712. The inactive part of the Flexible Capacity record floats on top of the TFP-Hardware capacity.

System A is in a Sysplex with System B that has the same configuration.

Now, the data-center operator decides to perform maintenance on System A and transfers its active Flexible Capacity to System B.

Figure D-11shows the configuration of both machines after the transfer.

System A transferred all of its Flexible Capacity to System B and is left with only the base capacity of 401. On top of the base capacity sits the TFP-Hardware capacity.

<!-- missing-text -->

System A transferred all of its Flexible Capacity to System B and is left with only the base capacity of 401. On top of the base capacity sits the TFP-Hardware capacity.

Now, System A can safely perform maintenance.

System B has now the entire Flexible Capacity record activated and shows an active capacity of 720. The TFP-Hardware capacity sits again on top of the active capacity and adds now another 2 CPs to the 720.

This shows that the presence or activation of TFP-Hardware does not impact the amount of capacity that can be activated by a Flexible Capacity Transfer record.

The TFP-Hardware capacity always 'floats on top' of any other activated capacity for TFP-Hardware usage charging. Therefore, no double charging can occur.
