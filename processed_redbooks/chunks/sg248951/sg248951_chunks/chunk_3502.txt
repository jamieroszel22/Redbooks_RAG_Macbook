 option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP) or an IFL that is shared across a set of LPARs.

This capability is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) limit. It is not affected by changes to the logical or physical configuration of the system. This physical capacity limit can be specified in units of CPs or IFLs. The Change LPAR Controls and Customize Activation Profiles tasks on the HMC were enhanced to support this new function.
