d customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations.

Therefore, IBM z15 made DYNDISP=THIN the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.

CFCC Level 23

CFCC Level 23 is delivered on IBM IBM z14 servers with driver level 36. In addition to CFCC Level 22 enhancements, it introduces the following enhancements:

- /SM590000 Asynchronous cross invalidation (XI) for CF cache structures

This enhancement requires z/OS fixes for APARs OA54688 (exploitation) and OA54985 (toleration). It also requires specific data manager support (Db2 V12 with PTFs).

- /SM590000 Coupling Facility hang detection

These enhancements provide a significant reduction in failure scope and client disruption (CF-level to structure-level), with no loss of FFDC collection capability. With this support, the CFCC dispatcher significantly reduces the CF hang detection interval to only 2 seconds, which allows more timely detection and recovery from such events.
