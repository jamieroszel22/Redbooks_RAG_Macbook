l of the prerequisites are met, the entire process (from ordering to activation of the upgrade) is performed by the customer, and does not require any onsite presence of IBM SSRs.

CIU prerequisites

The CIU facility supports LICCC upgrades only. It does not support I/O upgrades. All other capacity that is required for an upgrade must be previously installed. Extra processor drawers or I/O cards cannot be installed as part of an order that is placed through the CIU facility. The sum of CPs, unassigned CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, IFLs, and unassigned IFLs cannot exceed the client PU count of the installed processor drawers. The total number of zIIPs can be twice the number of purchased CPs.

CIU registration and contract for CIU

To use the CIU facility, a customer must be registered and the system must be set up. After you complete the CIU registration, access to the CIU application is available through the IBM Resource Link website.
