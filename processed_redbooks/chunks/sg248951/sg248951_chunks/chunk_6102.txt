a cryptographic functions library that is running on Linux on IBM Z also can start CPACF synchronous functions.

The following tools might benefit from the throughput improvements for IBM z16 CPACF:

- /SM590000 Db2/IMS encryption tool
- /SM590000 Db2 built-in encryption
- /SM590000 z/OS Communication Server: IPsec/IKE/AT-TLS
- /SM590000 z/OS System SSL
- /SM590000 z/OS Network Authentication Service (Kerberos)
- /SM590000 DFDSS Volume encryption
- /SM590000 z/OS Java SDK
- /SM590000 z/OS Encryption Facility
- /SM590000 Linux on IBM Z: Kernel, openSSL, openCryptoki, and GSKIT

The IBM z16 hardware includes the implementation of algorithms as hardware synchronous operations. This configuration holds the PU processing of the instruction flow until the operation completes.

IBM z16 offers the following synchronous functions:
