g Encryption

VFPE refers to a method of encryption in which the resulting cipher text features the same form as the input clear text. The form of the text can vary according to use and application.

One of the classic examples is a 16-digit credit card number. After VFPE is used to encrypt a credit card number, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications.
