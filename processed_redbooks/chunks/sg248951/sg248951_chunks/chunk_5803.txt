4.7.4  Crypto Express6S feature (FC 0893) as carry forward only

Crypto Express6S was introduced from IBM z14 servers. On the initial configuration, a minimum of two features are installed (for availability). The number of features then increases one at a time up to a maximum of 16 features.

Each Crypto Express6S feature holds one PCI Express cryptographic adapter. Each adapter can be configured by the installation as a Secure IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) coprocessor, as a Secure IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 (EP11) coprocessor, or as an accelerator.
