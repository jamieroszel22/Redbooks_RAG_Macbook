- -Customer operation code is separate from maintenance code
- -Native PCIe firmware stack that is running on the integrated firmware processor (IFP) to manage isolation and recovery

The power service and control network (PSCN) is used to control and monitor the elements in the system and include the following components:

- /SM590000 Ethernet Top of Rack (TOR) switches provide the internal PSCN connectivity:
- -Switches are redundant (N+1)
- -Concurrently maintainable
- -Each switch has one integrated power supply
- -BMCs are cross wired to the Ethernet switches
- /SM590000 Redundant SEs

Each SE has two power supplies (N+1) and input power is cross-coupled from the PDUs.
