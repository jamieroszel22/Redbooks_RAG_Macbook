rating system. In z/OS, the Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF) provides the APIs and is managing the access to the cryptographic devices, as shown in Figure 6-3.

ICSF is a software component of z/OS. ICSF works with the hardware cryptographic features and the Security Server (IBM Resource Access Control Facility [IBM RACF] element) to provide secure, high-speed cryptographic services in the z/OS environment. ICSF provides the APIs by which applications request the cryptographic services, and from the CPACF and the Crypto Express features.

ICSF transparently routes application requests for cryptographic services to one of the integrated cryptographic engines (CPACF or a Crypto Express feature), depending on performance or requested cryptographic function. ICSF is also the means by which the secure Crypto Express features are loaded with master key values, which allows the hardware features to be used by applications.
