E is not supported).

The 25 GbE RoCE Express2 has one PCHID and the same virtualization characteristics and the 10 GbE RoCE Express2 (FC 0412 and FC 0432); that is, 126 Virtual Functions per PCHID.

z/OS requires fixes for APAR OA55686. RMF 2.2 and later also is enhanced to recognize the CX4 card type and properly display CX4 cards in the PCIe Activity reports.

25 GbE RoCE Express2 feature also are used by Linux on IBM Z for applications that are coded to the native RoCE verb interface or use Ethernet (such as TCP/IP). This native exploitation does not require a peer OSA.

Support for select Linux on IBM Z distributions is now provided for Shared Memory Communications over Remote Direct Memory Access (SMC-R) by using RoCE Express features. For more information, see this Linux on IBM Z Blogspot web page.
