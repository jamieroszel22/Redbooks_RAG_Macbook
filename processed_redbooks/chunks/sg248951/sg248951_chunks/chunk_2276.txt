rent PCIe fan-outs. Normally, each PCIe interconnect in a pair supports the eight features in its domain. In backup operation mode, one PCIe interconnect supports all 16 features in the domain pair.

Note: The PCIe Interconnect (switch) adapter must be installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer to maintain the interconnect across I/O domains. If the adapter is removed (for a service operation), the I/O cards in that domain (up to eight) become unavailable.

2.7.2  Enhanced drawer availability

With EDA, the effect of CPC drawer replacement is minimized. In a multiple CPC drawer system, a single CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for an upgrade or repair. Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer.
