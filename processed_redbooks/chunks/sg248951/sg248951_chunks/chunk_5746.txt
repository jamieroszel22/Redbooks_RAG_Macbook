r consolidation, and can reduce complexity and simplify network configuration. It also allows LAN administrators to maintain the mainframe network environment similarly to nonmainframe environments.

Packet forwarding decisions are based on Layer 2 information instead of Layer 3. The HiperSockets device can run automatic MAC address generation to create uniqueness within and across LPARs and servers. The use of Group MAC addresses for multicast is supported, and broadcasts to all other Layer 2 devices on the same HiperSockets networks.

Datagrams are delivered only between HiperSockets devices that use the same transport mode. A Layer 2 device cannot communicate directly to a Layer 3 device in another LPAR network. A HiperSockets device can filter inbound datagrams by VLAN identification, the destination MAC address, or both.
