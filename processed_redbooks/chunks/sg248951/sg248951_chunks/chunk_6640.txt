peeds compared to the coprocessor.

The translation to protected key happens automatically after the attribute is set in the key token. No application change is required.

- /SM590000 New signatures

Support for the Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices signatures algorithm with the largest key sizes (MODE=3):

- -Public Key size: 1760 bytes
- -Private Key Size: 3856 bytes
- -Signature Size: 3366 bytes

Lattice-based cryptographic keys are protected by the 256-bit AES MK. The lattice-based key has a security strength of 128 bits.

- /SM590000 TR-31 for Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

HMAC keys are used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. This support provides a standard method of exchanging HMAC keys with a partner that uses symmetric key techniques. The key is exchanged in the standard TR-31 key block format, which can be used by any crypto system that supports the standard.
