- /SM590000 Mange System Time Enhancements
- Starting with IBM z14, a major change was made to how STP management is handled on the HMC and SE. All STP management is now done by way of the Manage System Time option on the HMC.

With IBM z16, further improvements were made in the wizards to guide you though the different configuration possibilities. Most of the changes are visual to provide clearer guidance.
