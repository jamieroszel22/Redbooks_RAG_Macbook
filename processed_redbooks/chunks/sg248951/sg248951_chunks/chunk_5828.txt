A sample of channel paths that are defined as dedicated, shared, and spanned is shown in Figure 5-3.

<!-- missing-text -->

The following definitions of a channel path are shown in Figure 5-3:

- /SM590000 CHPID FF, assigned to PCHID 20A, is dedicated access for partition 15 of LCSS0. The same applies to CHPID 00,01,02 of LCSS0, and CHPID 00,01,FF of LCSS1.
- /SM590000 CHPID 03, assigned to PCHID 20E, is shared access for partition 2, and 15 of LCSS0. The same applies to CHPID 05 of LCSS1.
- /SM590000 CHPID 06, assigned to PCHID 120 is spanned access for partition 1, 15 of LCSS0, and partition 16, 17 of LCSS1. The same applies to CHPID 04.

Channel spanning is supported for internal links (HiperSockets and IC links) and for specific types of external links. External links that are supported on IBM z16 A01 systems include FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, FICON Express16S+, OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, OSA-Express6S, and Coupling Links.
