le call home for a replacement. A system with a failed PU that is spared and requires a DCM to be replaced (referred to as a pending repair ) can still be upgraded when sufficient PUs are available.

Transparent CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, and IFP sparing

Depending on the model, sparing of CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, and IFP is transparent and does not require operating system or operator intervention.

With transparent sparing , the status of the application that was running on the failed processor is preserved. The application continues processing on a newly assigned CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, SAP, or IFP (allocated to one of the spare PUs) without client intervention.
