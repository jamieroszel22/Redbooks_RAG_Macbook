lable physical memory in the system. This memory includes the memory that is not in use by the system that is available but not purchased by the client, and the planned memory options, if installed.

Because of the memory allocation algorithm, systems that undergo many miscellaneous equipment specification (MES) upgrades for memory can have different memory mixes and quantities in all processor drawers of the system. If the memory fails, it is technically feasible to run a POR of the system with the remaining working memory resources. After the POR completes, the memory distribution across the processor drawers is different, as is the total amount of available memory.
