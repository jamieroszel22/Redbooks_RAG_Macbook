Fan-out slots

The fan-out slots are numbered LG01 - LG12 (from left to right), as listed in Table 4-2. All fan-out locations and their AIDs for the CPC drawer are shown for reference only.

Important: The AID numbers that are listed in Table 4-2 are valid for a new build system only. If a fan-out is moved, the AID follows the fan-out to its new physical location.

The AID assignment is listed in the PCHID REPORT that is provided for each new server or for an MES upgrade on servers. Part of a PCHID REPORT for an IBM z16 is shown in Example 4-1 on page 157. In this example, four fan-out cards are installed at locations A10/LG06, A15/LG06, A15/LG12, and A15/LG12 with AIDs 05, 11, and PCHIDs 100, 101, and 10C, respectively.
