A capacity marker identifies the number of CPs that were purchased. This number of purchased CPs is higher than or equal to the number of CPs that is actively used. The capacity marker marks the availability of purchased but unused capacity that is intended to be used as CPs in the future. This status often is present for software-charging reasons.
