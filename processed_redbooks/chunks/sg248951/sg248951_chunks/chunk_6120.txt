r a new build IBM z16 A01 system, but can be carried forward from an IBM z14 or IBM z15 by using an MES. Configuration information for Crypto Express8S is listed in Table 6-2.

<!-- missing-text -->

- a. The minimum initial order of Crypto Express8S feature 0909 is two. After the initial order, more Crypto Express8S features 0909 can be ordered individually.
- b. Crypto Express8S (dual HSM) has two hardware security modules (HSMs) per feature. The HSM is one IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCIeCC). The maximum number of HSMs per A01 system (combining all cryptographic features) is 60. The maximum number of single HSM (port) cryptographic features is 16 (CEX8S [single HSM], CEX7S [1 port], and CEX6S).
- c. More than one partition, which is defined to the same channel subsystem (CSS) or to different CSSs, can use the same domain number when assigned to different PCIe cryptographic adapters.
