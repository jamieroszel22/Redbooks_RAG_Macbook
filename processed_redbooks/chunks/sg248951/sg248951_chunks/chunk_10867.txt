 factors often are influencing the RNI of the workload. The interaction of all these factors results in a net RNI for the workload, which in turn directly relates to the performance of the workload.

These factors are tendencies, not absolutes. For example, a workload might have a low I/O rate, intensive processor use, and a high locality of reference, which all suggest a low RNI. However, it might be competing with many other applications within the same LPAR and many other LPARs on the processor, which tends to create a higher RNI. It is the net effect of the interaction of all these factors that determines the RNI.

The traditional factors that were used to categorize workloads in the past are shown with their RNI tendency in Figure 12-4.
