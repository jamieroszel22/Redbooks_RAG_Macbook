 3270 emulation for console session connections is integrated in the IBM z16 through a port on the OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T, OSA-Express7S GbE, OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T, or OSA-Express5S 1000BASE-T.

OSA-ICC can be configured on a PCHID-by-PCHID basis, and is supported at any of the feature settings. Each port can support up to 120 console session connections.

To improve security of console operations and to provide a secure, validated connectivity, OSA-ICC supports Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) with Certificate Authentication staring with IBM z13 GA2 (Driver level 27).

Note: OSA-ICC supports up to 48 secure sessions per CHPID (the overall maximum of 120 connections is unchanged).
