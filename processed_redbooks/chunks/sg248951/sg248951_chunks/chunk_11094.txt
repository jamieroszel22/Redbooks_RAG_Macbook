IBM zPCR Topology Report is based in the z/OS new Data Gatherer functionality delivered with APAR A62064, PTF available for z/OS 2.5 and z/OS 2.4. z/OS data is in the SMF 70.1 record.

z/VM support is provided in the 7.3 version and APARs are available for z/VM 7.1 and 7.2.

Additionally, consider collecting the z/OS SMF 99 Subtype 14 records for all LPARs in the IBM z16. Record has a single LPAR scope, so need all LPARs to get the total picture.
