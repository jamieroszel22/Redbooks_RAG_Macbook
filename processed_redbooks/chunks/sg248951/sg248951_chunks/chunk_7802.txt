QDIO data connection isolation for z/VM

The QDIO data connection isolation function provides a higher level of security when sharing an OSA connection in z/VM environments that use VSWITCH. The VSWITCH is a virtual network device that provides switching between OSA connections and the connected guest systems.

QDIO data connection isolation allows disabling internal routing for each QDIO connected. It also provides a means for creating security zones and preventing network traffic between the zones.

QDIO data connection isolation is supported by all OSA-Express features on IBM z16. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
