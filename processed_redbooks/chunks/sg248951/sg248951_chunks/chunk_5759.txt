wer or PCIe+ I/O drawer 14 . It allows the supported IBM Z to connect to each other over extended distance. The Coupling Express2 LR (FC 0434) is a two-port card that uses coupling channel type CL5.

The Coupling Express2 LR uses 10 GbE RoCE technology and is designed to drive distances up to 10 km (6.21 miles) unrepeated and support a link data rate of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps). For distance requirements greater than 10 km (6.21 miles), clients must use a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM). The WDM vendor must be qualified by IBM Z.

Coupling Express2 LR is designed to support up to four CHPIDs per port, 32 buffers (that is, 32 subchannels) per CHPID. The Coupling Express2 LR feature is in the PCIe+ I/O drawer on IBM z16.
