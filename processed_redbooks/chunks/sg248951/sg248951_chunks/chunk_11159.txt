The software and hardware pricing models provide customers an opportunity to grow and more fully use their IBM Z investment for new opportunities.

IBM originally introduced DevTest Solution and New Application Solution in 2017. These solutions further evolved when in May 2019, IBM announced two significant other solutions: Enterprise Consumption (since renamed to the Software Consumption Solution), and Enterprise Capacity Solution.

In May 2021, IBM announced a new hardware solution, called Hardware Consumption Solution. All of these options were gathered into a new family of IBM Z pricing called Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP).

The Software Consumption Solution and the Hardware Consumption Solution are discussed next.
