 task causes a program to be read from a designated device, and starts that program. You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server.

When an LPAR is active and an operating system is running in it, you can use the HMC to dynamically change certain LPAR parameters. The HMC provides an interface to change partition weights, add logical processors to partitions, and add memory.

LPAR weights also can be changed through a scheduled operation. Use the Customize Scheduled Operations task to define the weights that are set to LPARs at the scheduled time.

Channel paths can be dynamically configured on and off (as needed for each partition) from an HMC.

The Change LPAR Controls task for IBM z16 can export the Change LPAR Controls table data to a comma-separated value (. csv )-formatted file. This support is available to a user when they are remotely connected to the HMC by a web browser.
