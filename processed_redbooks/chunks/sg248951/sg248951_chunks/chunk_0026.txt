Now you can become a published author, too!

Here's an opportunity to spotlight your skills, grow your career, and become a published author-all at the same time! Join an IBM Redbooks residency project and help write a book in your area of expertise, while honing your experience using leading-edge technologies. Your efforts will help to increase product acceptance and customer satisfaction, as you expand your network of technical contacts and relationships. Residencies run from two to six weeks in length, and you can participate either in person or as a remote resident working from your home base.
