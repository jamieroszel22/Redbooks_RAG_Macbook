ation cannot require compliance with its standards. Compliance with PCI standards is enforced by the payment card brands, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB International, and Discover.

If you are a bank, acquirer, processor, or other participant in the payment card systems, the card brands can impose requirements on you if you want to process their cards. One set of requirements they are increasingly enforcing is the PCI standards.

The card brands work with PCI in developing these standards, and they focused first on the standards they considered most important, particularly the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Some of the other standards were written or required later, and PCI-HSM is one of the last standards to be developed. In addition, the standards themselves were increasing the strength of their requirements over time. Some requirements that were optional in earlier versions of the standards are now mandatory.
