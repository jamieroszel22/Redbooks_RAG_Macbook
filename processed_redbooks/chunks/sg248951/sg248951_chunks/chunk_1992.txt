 from IBM Flash Express to VFM. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM = total hardware plugged
- /SM590000 Dialed memory + VFM + Flex memory option = total hardware plugged

VFM helps improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when z/OS V2.1, V2.2, V2.3, V2.4, or V2.5 is run. With this support, z/OS helps improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM across transitional workload events, such as market openings and diagnostic data collection. z/OS also helps improve processor performance by supporting middleware use of pageable large (1 MB) pages and to help eliminate delays that can occur when collecting diagnostic data.

VFM also can be used by coupling facility images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.
