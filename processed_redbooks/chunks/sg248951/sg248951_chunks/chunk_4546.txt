14. The Virtual Flash Memory feature code is 0644 on IBM z16 A01.

3.10.1  IBM Z Virtual Flash Memory overview

VFM replaced the PCIe Flash Express feature with support that is based on main memory.

The 'storage class memory' that is provided by Flash Express adapters is replaced with memory that is allocated from main memory (VFM).

VFM helps improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when running z/OS. With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM across transitional workload events, such as market openings and diagnostic data collection.

z/OS also helps improve processor performance by supporting middleware use of pageable large (1 MB) pages, and eliminates delays that can occur when collecting diagnostic data during failures.

VFM also can be used in CF images to provide extended capacity and availability for workloads that use IBM WebSphere MQ Shared Queues structures.
