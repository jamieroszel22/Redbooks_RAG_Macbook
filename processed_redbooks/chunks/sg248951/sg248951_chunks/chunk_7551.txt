f words (IDAWs). Each IDAW contains an address that designates a data area within real storage.

<!-- missing-text -->

The number of required IDAWs for a CCW is determined by the following factors:

- /SM590000 IDAW format as specified in the operation request block (ORB)
- /SM590000 Count field of the CCW
- /SM590000 Data address in the initial IDAW

For example, three IDAWS are required when the following events occur:

- /SM590000 The ORB specifies format-2 IDAWs with 4 KB blocks.
- /SM590000 The CCW count field specifies 8 KB.
- /SM590000 The first IDAW designates a location in the middle of a 4 KB block.
