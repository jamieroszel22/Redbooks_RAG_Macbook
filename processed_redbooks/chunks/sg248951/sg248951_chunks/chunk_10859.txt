te ratios (ITRRs) for the IBM z16 and the previous generation processor families. These ratios are based on measurements and projections that use standard IBM benchmarks in a controlled environment.

Note: The throughput that any user experiences can vary depending on the amount of multiprogramming in the user's job stream, the I/O configuration, and the workload that is processed. Therefore, no assurance can be given that an individual user can achieve throughput improvements that are equivalent to the performance ratios that are stated.

12.3  Fundamental components of workload performance

Workload performance is sensitive to the following major factors:

- /SM590000 Instruction path length
- /SM590000 Instruction complexity
- /SM590000 Memory hierarchy and memory nest

These factors are described next.
