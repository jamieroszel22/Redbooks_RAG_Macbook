, new cache structure, new Core-Nest interface, new branch prediction design that uses dense SRAM, and new on-chip AI accelerator for inference), the IBM Z processor performance continues to evolve.

Enhancements were made on the processor unit design, including the following examples:

- /SM590000 Cache structure
- /SM590000 Branch prediction mechanism
- /SM590000 Floating point unit
- /SM590000 Divide engine scheduler
- /SM590000 Load/Store Unit and Operand Store Compare (OSC)
- /SM590000 Simultaneous multi-threading
- /SM590000 Relative nest intensity (RNI) redesigns

For more information about RNI, see 12.4, 'Relative Nest Intensity' on page 479.

The processing performance was enhanced through the following changes to the IBM z16 processor design:
