anges. When new controllers are added to an I/O configuration or changes are made to existing controllers, the system discovers them and proposes configuration changes that are based on that policy.

zDAC provides real-time discovery for the FICON fabric, subsystem, and I/O device resource changes from z/OS. By exploring the discovered control units for defined logical control units (LCUs) and devices, zDAC compares the discovered controller information with the current system configuration. It then determines delta changes to the configuration for a proposed configuration.
