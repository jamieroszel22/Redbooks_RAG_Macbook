All native PCIe features should be ordered in pairs for redundancy. The features are assigned to one of the four resource groups (RGs) that are running on the IFP according to their physical location in the PCIe+ I/O drawer, which provides management functions and virtualization functions.

If two features of the same type are installed, one always is managed by resource group 1 (RG 1) or resource group 3 (RG3); the other feature is managed by resource group 2 (RG 2) or resource group 4 (RG 4). This configuration provides redundancy if one of the features or resource groups needs maintenance or fails.

The IFP and RGs support the following infrastructure management functions:
