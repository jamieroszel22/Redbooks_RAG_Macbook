o 10 km (6.21 miles) between IBM Z platforms. ICA SR features provide sysplex and timing connectivity direct to the CPC drawer, while Coupling Express2 LR features connect into the PCIe+ I/O Drawer.

Coupling links also can carry timing information (such as Server Time Protocol [STP]) for synchronizing time across multiple IBM Z CPCs in a Coordinated Time Network (CTN).

For more information about coupling and clustering features, see 4.5, 'I/O features' on page 158.

1.2.7  Cryptography

IBM z16 provides two main cryptographic functions: CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) and Crypto-Express8S.

CPACF

CPACF is a high-performance, low-latency coprocessor that performs symmetric key encryption operations and calculates message digests (hashes) in hardware. The following algorithms are supported:

- /SM590000 AES
- /SM590000 Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)
- /SM590000 Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-1
- /SM590000 SHA-2
- /SM590000 SHA-3
