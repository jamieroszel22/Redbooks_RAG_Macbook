evel, which is implemented on the semi-private part of one of the Level 2 caches in a chip module. The Level 4 cache function regulates coherent drawer-to-drawer traffic.

3.4  Processor unit design

Processor cycle time is especially important for processor-intensive applications. Current systems design is driven by processor cycle time, although improved cycle time does not automatically mean that the performance characteristics of the system improve.

IBM z16 A01 core frequency is 5.2 GHz (same as IBM z15 T01), but with increased number of processors that share larger caches to have shorter access times and improved capacity and performance.

Through innovative processor design (significant architecture changes, new cache structure, new Core-Nest interface, new branch prediction design that uses dense SRAM, and new on-chip AI accelerator for inference), the IBM Z processor performance continues to evolve.
