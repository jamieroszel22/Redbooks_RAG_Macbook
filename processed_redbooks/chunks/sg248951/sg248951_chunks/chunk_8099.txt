f the application for a specific system architecture within the constraints that are imposed by the ARCHITECTURE option. The TUNE level must not be lower than the setting in the ARCHITECTURE option.

Important: Use the previous IBM Z ARCHITECTURE or TUNE options for C/C++ programs if the same applications run on the previous IBM Z servers. However, if C/C++ applications run on IBM z16 servers only, use the latest ARCHITECTURE and TUNE options to ensure that the best performance possible is delivered through the latest instruction set additions.

For more information about the ARCHITECTURE , TUNE , and VECTOR compiler options, see z/OS XL C/C++ User's Guide, SC14-7307-40.
