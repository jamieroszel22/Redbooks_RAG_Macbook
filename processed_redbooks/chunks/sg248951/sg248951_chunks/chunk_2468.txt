2.9.2  Bulk Power Assembly-based configurations

The BPA configuration is the feature that allows customers to have truly redundant power cords with phase loss protection. Characteristics are similar to previous IBM Z, but BPA was redesigned to fit into the 19-inch frame.

No PDUs are installed in this configuration; instead, 1 or 2 pairs of BPAs are installed that house the bulk power distribution to all the components, and the Bulk Power Regulators (BPR).
