pports a PCIe I/O infrastructure. PCIe features are installed in PCIe+ I/O drawers. Up to 12 I/O drawers per IBM z16 can be ordered, which allows for up to 192 PCIe I/O and special purpose features.

For a four CPC drawer system, up to 48 PCIe+ fan-out slots can be populated with fan-out cards for data communications between the CPC drawers and the I/O infrastructure, and for coupling. The multiple channel subsystem (CSS) architecture allows up to six CSSs, each with 256 channels.

The IBM z16 implements PCIe Generation 4, which is used to connect the PCIe+ Gen3 dual port fan-out features in the CPC drawers. The I/O infrastructure is designed to reduce processor usage and I/O latency, and provide increased throughput and availability.
