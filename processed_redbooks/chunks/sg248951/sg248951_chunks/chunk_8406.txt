8.4.2  MES upgrades for memory

MES upgrades for memory can concurrently add memory in the following ways:

- /SM590000 Through LICCC, which enables more capacity up to the limit of the installed DIMM memory cards.
- /SM590000 Concurrently installing CPC drawers and LICCC-enabling memory capacity on the new CPC drawers.

The Flexible Memory Feature is available to allow better control over future memory upgrades. For more information about flexible memory features, see 2.5.7, 'Flexible Memory Option' on page 46.

If the IBM z16 is a multiple processor drawer configuration, you can use the EDA feature to remove a processor drawer and add DIMM memory cards. It also can be used to upgrade the installed memory cards to a larger capacity size. You can then use LICCC to enable the extra memory.
