phy Standards #11 (PKCS) Coprocessor (CEX8P)
- /SM590000 IBM Crypto Express7S Accelerator (CEX8A)

During the feature installation, the PCI-X adapter is configured by default as the CCA coprocessor.

The configuration of the Crypto Express8S adapter as EP11 coprocessor requires a TKE workstation (FC 0057/0058) with TKE 10.0 (FC 0882) LIC. The same requirement applies to CCA mode for a full PCI-compliant environment.

The Crypto Express8S feature does not use CHPIDs from the channel subsystem pool. However, the Crypto Express8S feature requires one slot in a PCIe I/O drawer, and one PCHID for each PCIe cryptographic adapter.

For enabling an LPAR to use a Crypto Express8S adapter, the following cryptographic resources in the image profile must be defined for each partition:

- /SM590000 Usage domain index
- /SM590000 Control domain index
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Candidate List
- /SM590000 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Online List
