- /SM590000 z/OS Communications Server uses the zIIP for eligible Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) network encryption workloads. Portions of IPSec processing take advantage of the zIIPs, specifically end-to-end encryption with IPSec. The IPSec function moves a portion of the processing from the general-purpose processors to the zIIPs. In addition, to run the encryption processing, the zIIP also handles the cryptographic validation of message integrity and IPSec header processing.
- /SM590000 z/OS Global Mirror, formerly known as Extended Remote Copy (XRC), also uses the zIIP. Most z/OS Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (DFSMS) system data mover (SDM) processing that is associated with z/OS Global Mirror can run on the zIIP.
