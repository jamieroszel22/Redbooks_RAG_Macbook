g Facility (CFCC) dispatcher to provide CF work management efficiency and processor scalability improvements, and improve the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks.

The tasks that are waiting for CF latches are not placed on the global suspend queue at all; instead, they are placed on latch-specific waiter queues for the exact instance of the latch they are requesting, and in the exact order in which they requested the latch. As a result, the global suspend queue is much less heavily used, and thus is much less a source of global contention or cache misses in the CF.
