est performance and availability. Redundant power supplies and six SMP9 ports also are shown. Each pair of SMP9 ports is redundant. If a single cable fails, the repair can be performed concurrently.

The CPC drawer logical structure, component connections are shown in Figure 2-9.

Memory is connected to the DCMs through memory control units (MCUs). Up to six MCUs are available in a CPC drawer (one or two per DCM) and provide the interface to the DIMM controller. A memory controller uses eight DIMM slots.

The buses are organized in the following configurations:

- /SM590000 The M-bus provides interconnects between PU chips in the same DCM
- /SM590000 The X-bus provides interconnects between PU chips to each other, in the same drawer
- /SM590000 The A-bus provides interconnects between different drawers by using SMP9 cables
