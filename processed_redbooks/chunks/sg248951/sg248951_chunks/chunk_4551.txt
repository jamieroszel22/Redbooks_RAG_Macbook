es. An appliance is an integration of operating system, middleware, and software components that work autonomously and provide core services and infrastructures that focus on usability and security.

IBM SSC hosts most sensitive client workloads and applications. It acts as a highly protected and secured digital vault, enforcing security by encrypting the entire stack: memory, network, and data (both in-flight and at-rest). Applications that are running inside IBM SSC are isolated and protected from outsider and insider threats.

IBM SSC combines hardware, software, and middleware and is unique to IBM Z platform. Though it is called a container, it should not be confused with purely software open source containers (such as Kubernetes or Docker).

IBM SSC is a part of the Pervasive Encryption concept that was introduced with IBM z14, which is aimed at delivering best IBM Security hardware and software enhancements, services, and practices for 360-degree infrastructure protection.
