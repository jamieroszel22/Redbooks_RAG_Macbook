ity) for up to 39 CPs. When subcapacity settings are used, PUs beyond 39 can be characterized only as specialty engines. For models with more that 39 CPs, all CPs are running at full capacity (7xx).

The three defined ranges of subcapacity settings include model capacity identifiers numbered 401- 439, 501 - 539, and 601 - 639.

Consideration: All CPs have the same capacity identifier. Specialty engines (IFLs, zIIPs, and ICFs) operate at full speed.

List of model capacity identifiers

Regardless of the number of CPC drawers, a configuration with one characterized CP is possible, as listed in Table 2-13.

2.9  Power and cooling

The IBM z16 A01 power and cooling system is similar to IBM z15 T01 systems, which is packaged in an industry-standard, 19-inch form factor frame for all the internal system elements. The configuration can consist of 1 - 4 frames.
