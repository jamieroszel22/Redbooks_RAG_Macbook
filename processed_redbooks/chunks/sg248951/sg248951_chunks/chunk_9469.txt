- /SM590000 The processor recovery logic is on the DCM and includes the following RAS characteristics:
- -PU refresh for soft errors
- -Hardened RU (recovery unit) with wordline failure detection
- -Improved latch interleaving (spacing) for soft error resistance
- -Core sparing for hard errors: All servers ship with two spare cores
- -Improved long-term thresholding
- -Redesigned nest
- -Concurrent repair by way of concurrent drawer repair (CDR)
- -Concurrent upgrade by way of LICCC and enhanced drawer availability (EDA)
- /SM590000 L1 and L1 shadow: L1 shadow is new on IBM z16 and includes the following characteristics:
- -Behaves like the L1 (for repairs)
- -Contains changed data
- -All unrecoverable error (UE) checkstop core: UEs are refetched before acting
- -UE impact depends on system state:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Before end OP, IPD without storage validity
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Before SIE sync, System Damage
- /SM590000 IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI (AIU)
