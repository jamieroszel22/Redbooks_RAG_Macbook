10.2.7  HMC feature codes

On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the HMA FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. Stand-alone, outside the IBM z16 HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) can no longer be ordered.

The following HMC feature codes can be carried forward from previous systems:

- /SM590000 Tower FC 0082
- /SM590000 Tower FC 0062
- /SM590000 1U Rack Mount FC 0083
- /SM590000 1U Rack Mount FC 0063

With these HMC feature codes, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed to support IBM z16. On the HMCs of the HMA for IBM z15, FC 0100, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 also can be installed.
