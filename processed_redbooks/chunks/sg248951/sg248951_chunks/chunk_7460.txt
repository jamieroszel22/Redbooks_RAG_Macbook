Automation

The client's automation product can be used to automate and control the following System Recovery Boost activities:

- /SM590000 To activate and deactivate the eBod temporary capacity record to provide more physical zIIPs for an IPL or Shutdown Boost.
- /SM590000 To dynamically modify LPAR weights, as might be needed to modify sharing physical zIIP capacity during a Boost period.
- /SM590000 To drive the invocation of the PROC that indicates the beginning of a shutdown process (and the start of the shut-down Boost).
- /SM590000 To take advantage of new composite hardware API reconfiguration actions.
- /SM590000 To control the level of parallelism that is present in the workload at startup (for example, starting middleware regions) and shutdown (for example, performing an orderly shutdown of middleware).
