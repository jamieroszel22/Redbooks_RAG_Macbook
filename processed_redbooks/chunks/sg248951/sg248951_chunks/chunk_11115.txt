 Figure B-3 shows the high level of seamless integration of AI accelerator into enterprise AI/ML solution stack. Great flexibility and interoperability are realized for training and building models.

Acknowledging the diverse AI training frameworks, customers can train their models on platforms of their choice, including IBM Z (on-premises and in hybrid cloud) and then, deploy it efficiently on IBM Z in colocation with the transactional workloads. No other development effort is needed to enable this strategy.

To allow this flexible 'Train anywhere, Deploy on IBM Z' approach, IBM invests in Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) technology (see Figure B-3).
