ysplex supports connectivity between systems that differ by up to two generations (n-2). For example, an IBM z16 can participate in an IBM Parallel Sysplex cluster with IBM z15, and IBM z14 systems.

Only Integrated Coupling Adapter Short Reach (ICA SR) and Coupling Express2 Long Reach (CE2 LR) features are supported on IBM z16.

Figure 4-4 shows the supported Coupling Link connections for the IBM z16. Only ICA SR and CE LR links are supported on IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14 ZR1 systems.

The coupling link options are listed in Table 4-10. Also listed is the coupling link support for each IBM Z platform. Restrictions on the maximum numbers can apply, depending on the configuration. Always check with your IBM support team for more information.
