2.3.3  PU characterization

The PUs are characterized for client use. The characterized PUs can be used in general to run supported operating systems, such as z/OS, z/VM, and Linux on IBM Z. They also can run specific workloads, such as Java, XML services, IPsec, and some Db2 workloads, or clustering functions, such as the Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC).
