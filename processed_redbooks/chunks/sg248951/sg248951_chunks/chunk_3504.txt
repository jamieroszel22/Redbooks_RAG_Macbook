to pay software license fees that are based on the processor utilization of the LPAR on which the product is running, rather than on the total capacity of the system.

Consider the following points:

- -In support of WLC, the user can specify a defined capacity in millions of service units (MSUs) per hour. The defined capacity sets the capacity of an individual LPAR when soft capping is selected.
- The defined capacity value is specified on the Options tab in the Customize Image Profiles window.
- -WLM keeps a four-hour rolling average of the processor usage of the LPAR. When the four-hour average processor consumption exceeds the defined capacity limit, WLM dynamically activates LPAR capping (soft capping). When the rolling four-hour average returns below the defined capacity, the soft cap is removed.

For more information about WLM, see System Programmer's Guide to: Workload Manager , SG24-6472.
