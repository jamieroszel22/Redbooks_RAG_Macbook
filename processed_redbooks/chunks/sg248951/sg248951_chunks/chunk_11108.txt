- a. The link data rate does not represent the performance of the link. The performance depends on many factors, including latency through the adapters, cable lengths, and the type of workload.
- b. Where applicable, the minimum fiber bandwidth distance in MHz-km for multi-mode fiber optic links is included in parentheses.
- c. For 32 Gbps links, point to point (to another switch, director, DWDM equipment or another FICON Express3sS) distance is limited to 5 km (3.1 miles).
- d. A 600 meters (1958.5 feet) maximum when sharing the switch across two RoCE Express features.

The unrepeated distances for different multimode (MM) fiber optic types for zHyperLink Express are listed in Table A-2.
