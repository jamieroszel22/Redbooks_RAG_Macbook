used by the operating system. Through operating system recovery services, the task is resumed successfully (in most cases, without client intervention).

Dynamic SAP and IFP sparing and reassignment

Dynamic recovery is provided if a failure of the SAP or IFP occurs. If the SAP or IFP fails, and if a spare PU is available, the spare PU is dynamically assigned as a new SAP or IFP. If no spare PU is available, and more than one CP is characterized, a characterized CP is reassigned as an SAP or IFP. In either case, client intervention is not required. This capability eliminates an unplanned outage and allows a service action to be deferred to a more convenient time.
