for the encryption and exchange of secret keys, which in turn are used to encrypt bulk data with a symmetric algorithm.

Examples for asymmetric algorithms are RSA and the elliptic curve algorithms.

- /SM590000 One-way algorithms are not cryptographic functions. They do not use keys, and they can scramble data only, not de-scramble it. These algorithms are used extensively within cryptographic procedures for digital signing and tend to be developed and governed by using the same principles as cryptographic algorithms. One-way algorithms are also known as hash algorithms .

The most prominent one-way algorithms are the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA).
