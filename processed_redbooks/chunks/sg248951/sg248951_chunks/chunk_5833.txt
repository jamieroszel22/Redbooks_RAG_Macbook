- /SM590000 Hardware configuration definition (HCD)

HCD supplies an interactive dialog to generate the IODF, and later the IOCDS. Generally, use HCD or Hardware Configuration Manager (HCM) to generate the I/O configuration rather than writing I/O configuration program (IOCP) statements. The validation checking that HCD runs against a IODF source file helps minimize the risk of errors before an I/O configuration is activated.

HCD support for multiple channel subsystems is available with z/VM and z/OS. HCD provides the capability to make dynamic hardware and software I/O configuration changes.

Note: Specific functions might require specific levels of an operating system, PTFs, or both.
