ion Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 4 and PCI HSM security requirements for hardware security modules.

IBM z16 is the industry's first quantum-safe system . Consider the following points: 5

- /SM590000 IBM z16 quantum-safe secure boot technology helps to protect IBM Z firmware from quantum attacks by using a build-in dual signature scheme with no changes required.
- /SM590000 IBM z16 quantum-safe technology and key management services were developed to help you protect data and keys against a potential future quantum attack, such as harvest now, decrypt later.
- /SM590000 IBM z16 positions customers to use quantum-safe cryptography along with classic cryptography as they begin modernizing existing applications and building new applications.
