 industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device includes an LR transceiver. The transceivers at both ends must be the same (LR to LR).

The OSA-Express7S 10 GbE LR feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only.

A 9 Âµm single-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting this feature to the selected device.
