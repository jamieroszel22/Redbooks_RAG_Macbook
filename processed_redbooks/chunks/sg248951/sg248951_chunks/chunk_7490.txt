at is, Nest Compression Accelerator (NXU) and supports Deflate/gzip/zlib algorithms.

For more information, see Appendix C, 'IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression' on page 507.

Each PU chip includes one on-chip compression unit, which is designed to replace the zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) Express PCIe feature that is available on IBM z14 and earlier.

Note: The zEDC Express feature that is available on older systems is not carried forward to IBM z16.

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC maintains software compatibility with zEDC Express use cases. For more information, see Integrated Acceleratorfor zEnterprise Data Compression .

The z/OS zEDC capability is a software-priced feature that is designed to support compression capable hardware. With IBM z16, the zEDC feature is implemented in the on-chip compression accelerator unit, but the software (z/OS) component is required to maintain the same functions as previous PCIe-based zEDC features.
