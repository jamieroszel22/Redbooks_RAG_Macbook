- /SM590000 Request latency/performance improvements

CFCC and coupling link firmware and hardware improvements to reduce link latency.

- /SM590000 Elimination of VSAM RLS orphaned cast-out lock problems and improved VSAM RLS Structure Full recovery processing.

Addresses reoccurring problems that are encountered by installations running VSAM RLS data sharing.

Retry Buffer support that is used on list and lock commands is extended to nonidempotent cache commands and optimized lock commands.

The new support also allows connectors to lock structures to specify a percentage of record data entries to be reserved. These reserved entries are off limits to normal requests to the coupling facility and can be used only if a new keyword is used on lock requests that generate record data entries.
