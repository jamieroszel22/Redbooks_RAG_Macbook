lanned disaster test, GDPS concurrently adds CPs to the systems in the take-over site to restore processing power for mission-critical production workloads. GDPS automation runs the following tasks:

- /SM590000 The analysis that is required to determine the scope of the failure. This process minimizes operator intervention and the potential for errors.
- /SM590000 Automates authentication and activation of the reserved CPs.
- /SM590000 Automatically restarts the critical applications after reserved CP activation.
- /SM590000 Reduces the outage time to restart critical workloads from several hours to minutes.

The GDPS service is for z/OS only, or for z/OS in combination with Linux on Z.
