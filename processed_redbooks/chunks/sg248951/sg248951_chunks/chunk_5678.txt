gle round trip to the control unit. This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.

Read Diagnostic Parameter Extended Link Service support

To improve the accuracy of identifying a failed component without unnecessarily replacing components in a SAN fabric, a new Extended Link Service (ELS) command called Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) was added to the Fibre Channel T11 standard. This command allows IBM Z servers to obtain extra diagnostic data from the SFP optics that are throughout the SAN fabric.

IBM z14 and newer servers can read this extra diagnostic data for all the ports that are accessed in the I/O configuration and make the data available to an LPAR. For z/OS LPARs that use FICON channels, z/OS displays the data with a new message and display command. For Linux on IBM Z, z/VM, and z/VSE, and LPARs that use FCP channels, this diagnostic data is available in a new window in the SAN Explorer tool.
