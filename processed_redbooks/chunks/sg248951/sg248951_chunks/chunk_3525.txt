e the z/VM capability of implementing virtual memory to guest virtual machines. The z/VM dedicated real storage can be shared between guest operating systems.

LPAR main storage allocation and usage

The IBM z16 storage allocation and usage possibilities depend on the image mode and the operating system that is deployed in the LPAR.

Important: The memory allocation and usage depends on the operating system architecture and tested (documented for each operating system) limits.

While the maximum supported memory per LPAR for IBM z16 is 32 TB, each operating system has its own support specifications.

For more information about general guidelines, see the PR/SM Planning Guide , SB10-7178, which is available at the IBM Resource Link website (log in required).
