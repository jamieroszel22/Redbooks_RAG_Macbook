on z/OS to enable the health check; it is automatically enabled at IPL and reacts to changes that might cause problems. The health check can be disabled by using the PARMLIB or SDSF modify commands.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257. For more information about FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR), see Chapter 4, 'Central processor complex I/O structure' on page 145.

Global resource serialization FICON CTC toleration

For some configurations that depend on ESCON CTC definitions, global resource serialization (GRS) FICON CTC toleration that is provided with APAR OA38230 is essential, especially after ESCON channel support was removed from IBM Z starting with IBM zEC12.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257.

Increased performance for the FCP protocol

The FCP LIC is modified to help increase I/O operations per second for small and large block sizes, and to support 32-Gbps link speeds.
