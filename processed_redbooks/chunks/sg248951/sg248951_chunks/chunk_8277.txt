The System Recovery Boost Upgrade record offering can be used to provide extra zIIP capacity that can be used by the System Recovery Boost facility. You might want to consider the use of this offering if your server is a full capacity model (7nn) and can benefit from more CP capacity (running on zIIPs) for system shutdown and restart. The capacity is delivered as zIIPs that can perform CP work during the boost periods for an LPAR.
