 the initial PU assignment is done during POR by using rules to optimize cache usage. This step is the 'physical' step, where CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and SAPs are allocated on the processor drawers.

When an LPAR is activated, PR/SM builds logical processors and allocates memory for the LPAR.

PR/SM assigns all logical processors to one CPC drawer that are packed into chips of that drawer and cooperates with operating system use of HiperDispatch.

All processor types of an IBM z16 can be dynamically reassigned, except IFPs.

Memory allocation changed from the previous IBM Z servers. Partition memory is now allocated based on processor drawer affinity. For more information, see 'Memory allocation' on page 113.

Logical processors are dispatched by PR/SM on physical processors. The assignment topology that is used by PR/SM to dispatch logical processors on physical PUs is also based on cache usage optimization.
