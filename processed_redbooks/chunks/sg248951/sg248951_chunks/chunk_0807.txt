Caution: Installation of a low voltage system to a high voltage facility will cause significant damage to the system's power components.

Considerations

Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 A-Frame is always present in every configuration
- /SM590000 1u Support Elements (x2) are always in A-Frame at locations A41 and A42
- /SM590000 1u 24-port internal Ethernet switches (x2) are always at locations A39 and A40 More Ethernet switches (x2) are available when necessary in Frame C or B
- /SM590000 I/O PCHID numbering starts with 0100 and increments depending on the number of features that is ordered. No PCHID number affinity is available to a fixed PCIe+ I/O drawer location as with previous systems.
