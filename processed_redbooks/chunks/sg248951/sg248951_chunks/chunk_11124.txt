The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC is fully compatible with zEDC. Data that is compressed by zEDC can be read by IBM z16 (the on-chip) NXU and vice versa.

All z/OS configurations stay the same

No changes are required when moving from earlier systems by using zEDC to IBM z16.

The IFAPRDxx feature is still required for authorized services. For problem state services, such as zlib use of Java, it is not required.

Consider fail-over and disaster recovery sizing

The order of magnitude throughput increase on IBM z16 means that the throughput requirements need to be considered whether failing over to earlier systems with zEDC.

On-chip compression introduces the following system reporting changes:
