finitions are used:

- /SM590000 Control Domain

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor domains that can be administered from this logical partition if it is set up as the TCP/IP host for the TKE.

If you are setting up the host TCP/IP in this logical partition to communicate with the TKE, the partition is used as a path to other domains' Master Keys. Indicate all the control domains that you want to access (including this partition's own control domain) from this partition.

- /SM590000 Control and Usage Domain

Identifies the cryptographic coprocessor domains that are assigned to the partition for all cryptographic coprocessors that are configured on the partition. The usage domains cannot be removed if they are online. The numbers that are selected must match the domain numbers that are entered in the Options data set when you start this partition instance of ICSF.
