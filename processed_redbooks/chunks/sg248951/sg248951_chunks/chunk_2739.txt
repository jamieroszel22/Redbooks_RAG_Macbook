Concurrent maintenance allows dynamic central processing complex (CPAC) drawer add and repair. 2

IBM z16 processors use 7 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography chip technology with advanced low latency pipeline design, which creates high-speed yet power-efficient circuit designs. The PU DCM has a dense packaging, which allows closed water loop cooling. The heat from the closed loop is dissipated into the air by a radiator unit (RU).

The external water-cooling option is no longer available on the IBM z16. For more information, see 2.9, 'Power and cooling' on page 59.

3.3.1  Cache levels and memory structure

The IBM z16 includes a new optimized memory subsystem design that focuses on keeping data 'closer' to the PU core. With the current processor configuration, all on-chip cache levels increased.

The IBM z16 A01 cache hierarchy is shown in Figure 3-3.
