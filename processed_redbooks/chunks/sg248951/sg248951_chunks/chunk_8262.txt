Concurrent hardware installation upgrades (MES ordered)

Configuration upgrades can be concurrent when installing the following resources:

- /SM590000 Processor drawers (which contain processors, memory, and fan-outs). Up to two processor drawers can be added concurrently on an IBM z16 A01 Max39 if feature codes 2981 and 2982 were ordered with the initial configuration.
- /SM590000 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-outs.
- /SM590000 I/O cards, when slots are still available on the installed PCIe+ I/O drawers.
- /SM590000 PCIe+ I/O drawers.

The concurrent I/O upgrade capability can be better used if a future target configuration is considered during the initial configuration.

Concurrent PU conversions (MES ordered)

IBM z16 A01 supports concurrent conversion between all PU types, which includes SAPs, to provide flexibility and meet changing business requirements.
