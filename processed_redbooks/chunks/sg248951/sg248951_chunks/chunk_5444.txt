 /SM590000 ICA SR (ICA SR and ICA SR1.1) fan-out cards: Two ports per card (feature) that connect to other (external) CPCs.

Note: IBM z16 does not support Parallel Sysplex InfiniBand (PSIFB) links.

Also, if and IBM z16 is part of a Parallel Sysplex or Coordinated Timing Network, InfiniBand links cannot be used on older servers, even if installed.

Unless otherwise noted, ICA SR is used for ICA SR and ICA SR1.1 for the rest of the chapter.

The PCIe fan-outs cards are installed in the rear of the CPC drawers. Each CPC drawer features 12 PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out slots.

The PCIe fan-outs and ICA SR fan-outs are installed in locations LG01 - LG12 at the rear in the CPC drawers (see Figure 2-8 on page 25).

On the CPC drawer, two BMC/OSC cards are available, each being a combination of a Base Management (BMC) card and an Oscillator Card (OSC) card. Each BMC/OSC card features one PPS port and one ETS port (RJ45 Ethernet) for both PTP and NTP.
