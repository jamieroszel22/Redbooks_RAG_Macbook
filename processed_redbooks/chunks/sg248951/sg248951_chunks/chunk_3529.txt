cific types of processor units can be defined within one LPAR. This feature increases flexibility and simplifies systems management by allowing z/VM to run the following tasks in the same z/VM LPAR:

- -Manage guests to operate Linux on IBM Z on IFLs
- -Operate z/VSE and z/OS on CPs
- -Offload z/OS system software processor usage, such as Db2 workloads on zIIPs
- -Provide an economical Java execution environment under z/OS on zIIPs
- /SM590000 IBM SSC

In IBM SSC mode, storage addressing is 64-bit for an embedded product. The amount of usable main storage by the appliance code that is deployed in the SSC LPAR is documented by the appliance code supplier.

3.7.3  Reserved storage

Reserved storage can be optionally defined to an LPAR, which allows a nondisruptive image memory upgrade for this partition. Reserved storage can be defined to central and expanded storage, and to any image mode except CF mode.

An LPAR must define an amount of main storage:
