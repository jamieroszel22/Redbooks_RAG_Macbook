IBM Integrated Accelerator for AI. For more information, see Chapter 2, 'Central processor complex hardware components' on page 15, and Appendix B, 'IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI' on page 503.

Because of these enhancements, the IBM z16 processor full speed z/OS single-thread performance is on average 1.11 times faster than the IBM z15 at equal N-way. For more information about performance, see Chapter 12, 'Performance and capacity planning' on page 473.

z13 servers introduced architectural extensions with instructions that reduce processor quiesce effects, cache misses, and pipeline disruption, and increase parallelism with instructions that process several operands in a single instruction (SIMD). The processor architecture was further developed for IBM z14 and IBM z15.

IBM z16 includes the following enhancements:
