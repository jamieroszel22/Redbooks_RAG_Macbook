S Media Manager includes I/O channel program support for implementing EF data sets, and automatically uses MIDAWs when appropriate. Most disk I/Os in the system are generated by using Media Manager.

Users of the Executing Fixed Channel Programs in Real Storage (EXCPVR) instruction can construct channel programs that contain MIDAWs. However, doing so requires that they construct an IOBE with the IOBEMIDA bit set. Users of the EXCP instruction cannot construct channel programs that contain MIDAWs.

The MIDAW facility removes the 4 K boundary restrictions of IDAWs and for EF data sets, which reduces the number of CCWs. Decreasing the number of CCWs helps to reduce the FICON channel processor use. Media Manager and MIDAWs do not cause the bits to move any faster across the FICON link. However, they reduce the number of frames and sequences that flow across the link and use the channel resources more efficiently.
