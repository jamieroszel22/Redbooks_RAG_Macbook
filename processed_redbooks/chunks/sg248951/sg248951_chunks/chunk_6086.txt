dvantage is that the key must be known by both sender and receiver of the messages, which implies that the key must be exchanged between them. This key exchange is a weak point that can be attacked.

Prominent examples for symmetric algorithms are DES, TDES, and AES.

- /SM590000 Asymmetric algorithms use two distinct but related keys: the public key and the private key . As the names imply, the private key must be kept secret, whereas the public key is shown to everyone. However, with asymmetric cryptography, it is not important who sees or knows the public key. Whatever is done with one key can be undone by the other key only.

For example, data that is encrypted by the public key can be decrypted by the associated private key only, and vice versa. Unlike symmetric algorithms, which use distinct functions for encryption and decryption, only one function is used in asymmetric algorithms. Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data.
