1.3  Hardware management

The Hardware Management Consoles (HMCs) and Support Elements (SEs) are appliances that together provide platform management for IBM Z.

The HMC is an appliance that provides a single point of control for managing local or remote hardware elements.

For IBM z16 new built systems, IBM Z Hardware Management Appliance (FC 0129) is the only available HMC. The HMC Appliance and SE Appliance run virtualized on the SE hardware.

Older stand-alone HMCs (rack-mounted or tower) can be carried forward during an MES upgrade to IBM z16.

For more information, see Chapter 10, 'Hardware Management Console and Support Element' on page 407.
