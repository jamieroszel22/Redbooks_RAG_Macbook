Hardware decimal floating point

Industry support for decimal floating point is growing, with IBM leading the open standard definition. Examples of support for the draft standard IEEE 754r include Java BigDecimal, C#, XML, C/C++, GCC, COBOL, and other key software vendors, such as Microsoft and SAP.

IBM z16 introduces COBOL optimization for Hexadecimal Floating Point (HFP) &lt;--&gt; Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) conversion, and Numeric Editing, and Zoned Decimal operations.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. For more information, see 7.5.8, 'z/OS XL C/C++ considerations' on page 321.
