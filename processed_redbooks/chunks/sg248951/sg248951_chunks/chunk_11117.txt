IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression

This appendix describes the new IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) that is implemented in IBM Z hardware.

The appendix includes the following topics:

- /SM590000 'Client value of IBM Z compression' on page 508
- /SM590000 'IBM z16 IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC' on page 509
- /SM590000 'IBM z16 migration considerations' on page 510
- /SM590000 'Software support' on page 511
- /SM590000 'Compression acceleration and Linux on IBM Z' on page 512

Client value of IBM Z compression

The amount of data that is captured, transferred, and stored continues to grow. Software-based compression algorithms can be costly in terms of processor resources, storage costs, and network bandwidth.
