Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery

Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery (ECAR) speeds up the process of BTS takeover by performing the following steps:

- 1. When the PTS/CTS detects a checkstop condition, the CEC informs its SE and HMC.
- 2. The PTS SE recognizes the checkstop pending condition, and calls the PTS SE STP code.
- 3. The PTS SE sends an ECAR request thorough HMC to the BTS SE.
- 4. The BTS SE communicates with the BTS to start the takeover.

ECAR support is faster than the original CAR support because the console path changes from a 2-way path to a 1-way path. Also, almost no lag time is incurred between the system checkstop and the start of CAR processing. Because the request is generated from the PTS before system logging, it avoids the potential of recovery being held up.
