hat are attached through control units, and channel paths between the subsystem and control units. For more information about the channel subsystem, see 5.1.1, 'Multiple logical channel subsystems'.

The design of IBM Z servers offers considerable processing power, memory size, and I/O connectivity. In support of the larger I/O capability, the CSS structure is scaled up by introducing the multiple logical channel subsystem (LCSS) since IBM z990, and multiple subchannel sets (MSS) since IBM z9.

An overview of the channel subsystem for IBM z16 servers is shown in Figure 5-1. IBM z16 A01 systems are designed to support up to six logical channel subsystems, each with four subchannel sets and up to 256 channels.
