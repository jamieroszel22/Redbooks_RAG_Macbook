nces to the timing network and the overall workload execution environment of the IBM Z sysplex. The IBM Z and the HMC feature longtime automated failover protection for various cases that can arise.

New for IBM z16 because an integrated battery facility no long is available, support was added by the HMC to allow the customer to configure an option to monitor for n-mode power conditions (wall power or power cord loss). If detected, an automated failover occurs to the Backup Time Server (BTS).

Note: Provide some backup power method to hold power for 60 seconds on the PTS to allow failover to successfully complete.

Manage System Time user interface controls are available to manage failback to the PTS when the full power state is restored.

ETS direct connectivity to the IBM z16 CPC is provided for both supported ETS protocols: NTP and PTP.
