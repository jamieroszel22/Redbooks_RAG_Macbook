 to coupling links for Parallel Sysplex, the fan-out cards provide connectivity for the PCIe+ I/O drawer (PCIe+ Gen3 fan-out).

Up to 12 PCIe fan-out cards can be installed in an IBM z16 CPC drawer.

To migrate from an older generation machine to an IBM z16 without disruption in a Parallel Sysplex environment requires that the older machines are no more than n-2 generation (namely, at least IBM z14) and that they carry enough coupling links to connect to the existing systems while also connecting to the new machine. This requirement is necessary to allow individual components (z/OS LPARs and CFs) to be shut down and moved to the target machine and continue to be connected to the remaining systems.

It is beyond the scope of this book to describe all possible migration scenarios. Always consult with subject matter experts to help you to develop your migration strategy.
