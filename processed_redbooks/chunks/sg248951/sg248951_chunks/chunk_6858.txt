6.5.4  Crypto Express8S as an accelerator

A Crypto Express8S adapter that is running in accelerator mode supports only RSA clear key and SSL Acceleration. A request is processed fully in hardware.

The Crypto Express accelerator is a coprocessor that is reconfigured by the installation process so that it uses only a subset of the coprocessor functions at a higher speed. Reconfiguration is disruptive to coprocessor and accelerator operations. The coprocessor or accelerator must be deactivated before you begin the reconfiguration.
