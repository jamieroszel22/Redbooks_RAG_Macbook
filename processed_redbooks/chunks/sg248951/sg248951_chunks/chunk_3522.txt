DPM is an IBM Z server operation mode that provides a simplified approach to create and manage virtualized environments, which reduces the barriers of its adoption for new and existing customers.

The implementation provides built-in integrated capabilities that allow advanced virtualization management on IBM Z servers. With DPM, you can use your Linux and virtualization skills while taking advantage of the full value of IBM Z hardware, robustness, and security in a workload optimized environment.

DPM provides facilities to define and run virtualized computing systems by using a firmware-managed environment that coordinate the physical system resources that are shared by the partitions. The partitions' resources include processors, memory, network, storage, crypto, and accelerators.

DPM provides a new mode of operation for IBM Z servers that provide the following services:
