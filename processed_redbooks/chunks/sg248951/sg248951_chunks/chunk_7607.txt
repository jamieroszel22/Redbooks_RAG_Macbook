and T02), and ordered with a new IBM z16 A01

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA-Express7S Gigabit Ethernet LX and SX (carry forward)

IBM z16 introduces an Ethernet technology refresh with OSA-Express7S Gigabit Ethernet features to be installed in the PCIe I/O drawer, which is supported by the 16 GBps PCIe Gen3 host bus. The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express6S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity.

Each adapter can be configured in the following modes:

- /SM590000 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD
- /SM590000 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC

Note: Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
