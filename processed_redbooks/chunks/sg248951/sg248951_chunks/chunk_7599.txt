New with the generation is the Long Reach version, which uses single mode fiber and can be point to point connected to a distance of up to 10 km (6.2 miles). The features connect to a 25 GbE switch and do not support auto-negotiation to a different speed.

Consider the following points regarding operating system support:

- /SM590000 z/OS V2R2 and V2R3 require fixes for the following APARs: OA55256 (IBM VTAMfi) and PI95703 (TCP/IP).
- /SM590000 V7R1 requires PTF for APAR PI99085.
