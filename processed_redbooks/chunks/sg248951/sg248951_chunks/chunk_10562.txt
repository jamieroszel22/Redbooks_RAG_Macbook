- /SM590000 HMC Data Replication enhancements

By using the Configure Data Replication task, configuration data can be exchanged between linked HMCs; for example, the User Profile Data can be replicated.

An HMC can feature the following replication roles:

- -Primary

An HMC in the role of primary is a Data Replication source to other HMCs that are in the role of replica. A primary HMC can be only a source for Data Replication; it cannot receive replicated data from other HMCs.

- -Peer

An HMC in the role of peer is Data Replication source to other HMCs that are in the role of peer or replica. An HMC in this role receives replicated data from other HMCs that are in the role of peer or primary.

- -Replica
