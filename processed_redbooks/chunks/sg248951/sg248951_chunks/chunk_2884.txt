rted for z/OS 8 . These options are user-specified in IEAOPTxx and can be dynamically altered by using the SET OPT command:

- /SM590000 Option 1: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=YES)

This option is the default option and specifies that CPs must not automatically consider zIIP-eligible work for dispatching on them. The zIIP-eligible work is dispatched on the zIIP engines until Workload Manager (WLM) determines that the zIIPs are overcommitted.

WLM then requests help from the CPs. When help is requested, the CPs consider dispatching zIIP-eligible work on the CPs based on the dispatching priority relative to other workloads. When the zIIP engines are no longer overcommitted, the CPs stop considering zIIP-eligible work for dispatch.

This option runs as much zIIP-eligible work on zIIPs as possible. It also allows it to spill over onto the CPs only when the zIIPs are overcommitted.
