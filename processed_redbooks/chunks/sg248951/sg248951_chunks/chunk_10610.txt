pacity (for example, 2.5 processors).

Absolute capping is specified as an absolute number of processors to which the group's activity is capped. The value is specified to hundredths of a processor (for example, 4.56 processors) worth of capacity.

The value is not tied to the Licensed Internal Code (LIC) configuration code (LICCC). Any value 0.01 - 255.00 can be specified. This configuration makes the profiles more portable,

which means that you do not encounter problems when profiles are migrated to new machines.

Although the absolute cap can be specified to hundredths of a processor, the exact amount might not be that precise. The same factors that influence the 'machine capacity' also influence the precision with which the absolute capping works.

LPAR absolute capping can be changed through scheduled operations start.
