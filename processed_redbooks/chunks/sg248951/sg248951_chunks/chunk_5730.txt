Note: Consider the following 25 GbE RoCE Express2.1 requirements:

- /SM590000 The 25 GbE RoCE Express2.1 feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only.
- /SM590000 25 GbE and 10 GbE RoCE features should not be mixed in a z/OS SMC-R Link Group.

Point-to-point connections and switched connections with an enterprise-class switch are supported (ports running at matching speeds).
