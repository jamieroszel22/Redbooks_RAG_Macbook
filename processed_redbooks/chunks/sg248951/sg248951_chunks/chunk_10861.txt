ming that the transaction or job is asked to run the same task each time.

However, the path length that is associated with the operating system or subsystem can vary based on the following factors:

- /SM590000 Competition with other tasks in the system for shared resources. As the total number of tasks grows, more instructions are needed to manage the resources.
- /SM590000 The number of logical processors ( n-way ) of the image or LPAR. As the number of logical processors grows, more instructions are needed to manage resources that are serialized by latches and locks.

12.3.2  Instruction complexity

The type of instructions and the sequence in which they are run interacts with the design of a microprocessor to affect a performance component. This factor is defined as instruction complexity . The following design alternatives affect this component:
