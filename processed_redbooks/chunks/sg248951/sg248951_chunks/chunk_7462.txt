ead on a zIIP (for eligible workloads in z/OS) or an IFL (for z/VM) core in single-thread or SMT mode.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

An operating system that uses SMT controls each core and is responsible for maximizing its throughput and meeting workload goals with the smallest number of cores. In z/OS, consider HiperDispatch cache optimization when you must choose the two threads to be dispatched in the same processor.

HiperDispatch attempts to dispatch guest virtual CPUs on the same logical processor on which they ran. PR/SM attempts to dispatch a vertical low logical processor in the same physical processor. If that process is not possible, it attempts to dispatch it in the same node, or then the same CPC drawer where it was dispatched before to maximize cache reuse.
