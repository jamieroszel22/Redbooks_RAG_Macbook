uns the checksum calculations for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets. The checksum offload function applies to packets that go to or come from the LAN.

When multiple IP stacks share an OSA-Express, and an IP stack sends a packet to a next hop address that is owned by another IP stack that is sharing the OSA-Express, OSA-Express sends the IP packet directly to the other IP stack. The packet does not have to be placed out on the LAN, which is termed LPAR-to-LPAR traffic. Checksum offload is enhanced to support the LPAR-to-LPAR traffic, which was not originally available.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
