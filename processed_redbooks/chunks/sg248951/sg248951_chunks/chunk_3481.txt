 which creates a high- and low-priority rank. Then, the resources, such as logical processors and memory, can be moved from one CPC drawer to another to address the priority ranks that were created.

When partitions are activated, PR/SM tries to find a home assignment CPC drawer, home assignment node, and home assignment chip for the logical processors that are defined to them. The PR/SM goal is to allocate all the partition logical processors and memory to a single CPC drawer (the home drawer for that partition).

If all logical processors can be assigned to a home drawer and the partition-defined memory is greater than what is available in that drawer, the exceeding memory amount is allocated on another CPC drawer. If all the logical processors cannot fit in one CPC drawer, the remaining logical processors spill to another CPC drawer. When that overlap occurs, PR/SM stripes the memory (if possible) across the CPC drawers where the logical processors are assigned.
