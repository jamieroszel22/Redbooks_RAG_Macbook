The definition of domain indexes and PCIe cryptographic adapter numbers in the candidate list for each LPAR must be planned to allow for nondisruptive changes. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Operational changes can be made by using the Change LPAR Cryptographic Controls task from the SE, which reflects the cryptographic definitions in the image profile for the partition. With this function, adding and removing the cryptographic feature without stopping a running operating system can be done dynamically.
- /SM590000 The same usage domain index can be defined more than once across multiple LPARs. However, the PCIe cryptographic adapter number that is coupled with the usage domain index that is specified must be unique across all active LPARs.
