 Shared-Engine CF Default to DYNDISP=THIN

Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Shared processor CFs can operate with different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:

- -DYNDISP=OFF : LPAR timeslicing controls the CF processor.
- -DYNDISP=ON : An optimization over pure LPAR timeslicing, in which the CFCC code manages timer interrupts to share processors more efficiently.
- -DYNDISP=THIN : An interrupt-driven model in which the CF processor is dispatched in response to a set of events that generate Thin Interrupts.

Thin Interrupt support was available since zEC12/zBC12,. It is proven to be efficient and well-performing in numerous different test and customer shared-engine coupling facility configurations.

Therefore, IBM z15 made DYNDISP=THIN the default mode of operation for coupling facility images that use shared processors.
