lex-wide data aggregation and propagation occur in the RMF Distributed Data Server (DDS). The RMF Common Information Model (CIM) providers and associated CIM models publish the RMF Monitor III data.

CPM retrieves critical metrics from one or more z/OS systems' CIM structures and protocols. CPM communicates to local and remote SEs and HMCs by using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

CPM can see the resources in the individual offering records and the capacity tokens. When CPM activates resources, a check is run to determine whether enough capacity tokens remain for the specified resource to be activated for at least 24 hours. If insufficient tokens remain, no resource from the On/Off CoD record is activated.
