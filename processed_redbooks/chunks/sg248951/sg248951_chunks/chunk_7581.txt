efresh. The features now also support LR optics and 25 Gbit Ethernet switches with relaxed requirements. The features are installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and are supported on IBM z16 servers only.

The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 are native PCIe features that not use a CHPID and are defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the hardware configuration definition (HCD).

The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID).

The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 SR (FC 0452) feature connects by using SR optics and multimode fiber that is terminated with LC connector. The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 LR (FC 0453) connects by using LR optics and single mode fiber that is terminated with LC connector.
