The need for ICKDSF Release 17 also applies to systems that are not part of the same sysplex, or are running an operating system other than z/OS, such as z/VM.

z/OS Discovery and Auto-Configuration

z/OS Discovery and Auto Configuration (zDAC) is designed to automatically run several I/O configuration definition tasks for new and changed disk and tape controllers that are connected to a switch or director, when attached to a FICON channel.

The zDAC function is integrated into the hardware configuration definition (HCD). Clients can define a policy that can include preferences for availability and bandwidth that include parallel access volume (PAV) definitions, control unit numbers, and device number ranges. When new controllers are added to an I/O configuration or changes are made to existing controllers, the system discovers them and proposes configuration changes that are based on that policy.
