10.5.10  NTP client and server support on the HMC

The NTP client support allows a STP-only CTN to use an NTP server as an ETS. This capability addresses the following requirements:

- /SM590000 Customers who want time synchronization for the servers members of the STP-only CTN
- /SM590000 Customers who use a common time reference across heterogeneous systems

The NTP server becomes the single time source (the ETS) for STP and other servers that are not IBM Z (such as AIXfi and Microsoft Windows) that include NTP clients.
