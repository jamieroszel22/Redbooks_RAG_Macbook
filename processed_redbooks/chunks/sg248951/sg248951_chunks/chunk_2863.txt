capacity planning and management for LPARs. The separation also affects weight management because CP and zIIP weights can be managed separately.

For more information, see 'PU weighting' on page 99.

All assigned PUs are grouped in the PU pool. These PUs are dispatched to online logical PUs. For example, consider an IBM z16 with 10 CPs, 2 IFLs, 5 zIIPs, and 1 ICF. This system has a PU pool of 18 PUs, called the pool width . Subdivision defines the following pools:

- /SM590000 A CP pool of 10 CPs
- /SM590000 An ICF pool of one ICF
- /SM590000 An IFL pool of two IFLs
- /SM590000 A zIIP pool of five zIIPs

PUs are placed in the pools in the following circumstances:

- /SM590000 When the system is PORed
- /SM590000 At the time of a concurrent upgrade
- /SM590000 As a result of adding PUs during a CBU
- /SM590000 Following a capacity on-demand upgrade through On/Off CoD or CIU.
