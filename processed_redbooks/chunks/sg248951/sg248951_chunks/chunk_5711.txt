A multi-mode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting each port on this feature to the selected device.

OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet (FC 0446)

Feature code 0446 occupies one slot in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. It features two ports that connect to a 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) Ethernet LAN. Each port has an SFP+ with an RJ-45 receptacle for cabling to an Ethernet switch. The RJ-45 receptacle is required to be attached by using an EIA/TIA Category 5 or Category 6 UTP cable with a maximum length of 100 meters (328 feet). The SFP allows a concurrent repair or replace action.

The OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature does not support auto-negotiation. It supports links at 1000 Mbps in full duplex mode only.

The OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE, or OSM. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE.

Note: CHPID types OSM, OSN, and OSX are not supported on IBM z16.
