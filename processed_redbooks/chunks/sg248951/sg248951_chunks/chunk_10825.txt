Power consumption

The utility power consumption for the IBM z16 for PDU option is listed in Table 11-4.

Note: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 The power values that are listed in this table assume the CPC process drawer and PCIe+ I/O drawers are plugged to the maximum with highest power features (that is, memory and I/O adapters and fan-outs). Also assumed is that maximum ambient temperature is used.
- /SM590000 Typical configurations and data center conditions result in lower power. A calculator available on Resource Link calculates power and weight for specific configurations and environmental conditions.

Considerations: Power consumption is lower in a normal ambient temperature room, and for configurations that feature a lesser number of I/O slots, smaller amount of memory, and fewer PUs.
