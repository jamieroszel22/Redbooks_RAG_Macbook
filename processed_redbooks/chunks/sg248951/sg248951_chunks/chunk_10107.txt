 of firmware components. For example, when you are upgrading the microcode of a FICON feature, enhancements are implemented to avoid any unwanted side effects that were detected on previous systems.

- /SM590000 Server Time Protocol (STP) recovery enhancement. IBM z16 updated the clocking structure:
- -System uses a mesosynchronous clocking structure (similar to IBM z15)
- -Two redundant oscillator cards in each drawer with dynamic oscillator switchover
- -STP now has external clock reference support, separate Ethernet ports for ETS
- -PTP and NTP (Ethernet cabling) are now directly connected to the CPC (no SE ETS connection needed)
- -Oscillator card shares FRU package with drawer' Base Control Card (BMC)
- -Concurrent repair of oscillator or control card
