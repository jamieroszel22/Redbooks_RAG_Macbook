/SM590000 CF monopolization avoidance

z/OS takes advantage of current CF support in CFLEVEL 24 (IBM z15 T01/T02) to deliver improved z/OS support for handling CF monopolization.

With IBM z15 T01/T02, the CF dispatcher monitors in real-time the number of CF tasks that have a command assigned to them for a specific structure on a structure-by-structure basis.

When the number of CF tasks that is used by any structure exceeds a model-dependent CF threshold, and a global threshold on the number of active tasks also is exceeded, the structure is considered to be 'monopolizing' the CF. z/OS is informed of this monopolization.
