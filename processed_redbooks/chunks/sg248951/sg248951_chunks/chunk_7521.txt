the CF's monopolization state information so as to observe the structure becoming 'non-monopolized' again, so that request processing can eventually revert back to a non-throttled mode of operation.

The overall goal of z/OS anti-monopolization support is to protect the ability of ALL well-behaved structures and workloads to access the CF, and get their requests processed in the CF in a timely fashion. At the same time, it implements queuing and throttling mechanisms in z/OS to hold back the specific abusive workloads that are causing problems for other workloads.

z/OS XCF/XES use of APAR support is required to provide this function.

Coupling Facility images can run with shared or dedicated processors. Shared processor CFs can operate with different Dynamic Dispatching (DYNDISP) models:
