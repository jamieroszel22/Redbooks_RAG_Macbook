16 configuration must have been generated via EDF for a configuration where CPU MF was enabled. The Topology window portrays how the partition's logical CPs and their classification are distributed:

- /SM590000 Across the installed drawers (maximum of 4)
- /SM590000 Across the 4 Dual Chip Modules (DCMs) on each drawer
- /SM590000 Across the 2 chips on each DCM

See Figure 12-10 on page 491.

The IBM zPCR topology report is shown in Figure 12-10 on page 491, where:

- /SM590000 LPARs are identified by row
- /SM590000 z16 Drawer/DCM/CHIP appears at the top lines
- /SM590000 Topology report displays warning messages
- /SM590000 LPARs Totals by Pool table is displayed at the bottom with support to filter by partition
- /SM590000 Report is accessed from the Partition Detail Window
- /SM590000 Latest versions of extract are required:
