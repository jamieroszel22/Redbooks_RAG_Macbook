590000 3-phase 380 - 415 V AC (5-wire 'Wye')

The power supply units convert the AC power to DC power that is used as input for the Point of Loads (POLs) in the CPC drawer and the PCIe+ I/O drawers.

The power requirements depend on the number of CPC drawers (1 - 4), number of PCIe I/O drawers (0 - 12) and I/O features that are installed in the PCIe I/O drawers.

PDUs are installed and serviced from the rear of the frame. Unused power ports never should be used by any external device.

A schematic view of a maximum that is configured system with PDU-based power is shown in Figure 2-27.

Each PDU installed requires a customer-supplied power feed. The number of power cords that are required depends on the system configuration.

Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully.
