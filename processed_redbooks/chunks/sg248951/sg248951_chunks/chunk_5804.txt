he installation as a Secure IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) coprocessor, as a Secure IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 (EP11) coprocessor, or as an accelerator.

The tamper-resistant hardware security module, which is contained on the Crypto Express6S feature, conforms to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 4 Certification. It supports UDX services to implement cryptographic functions and algorithms (when defined as an IBM CCA coprocessor).

The following CCA compliance levels are available:

- /SM590000 Noncompliant (default)
- /SM590000 PCI-HSM 2016
- /SM590000 PCI-HSM 2016 (migration, key tokens while migrating to compliant)

The following EP11 compliance levels are available (Crypto Express6S and Crypto Express5S):

- /SM590000 FIPS 2009 (default)
- /SM590000 FIPS 2011
- /SM590000 BSI 2009
- /SM590000 BSI 2011
