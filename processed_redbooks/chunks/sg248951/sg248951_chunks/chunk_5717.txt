-45 receptacle is required to be attached by using an EIA/TIA Category 5 or Category 6 UTP cable with a maximum length of 100 meters (328 feet). The SFP allows a concurrent repair or replace action.

The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature supports auto-negotiation when attached to an Ethernet router or switch. If you allow the LAN speed and duplex mode to default to auto-negotiation, the OSA-Express port and the attached router or switch auto-negotiate the LAN speed and duplex mode settings between them. They then connect at the highest common performance speed and duplex mode of interoperation. If the attached Ethernet router or switch does not support auto-negotiation, the OSA-Express port examines the signal that it is receiving and connects at the speed and duplex mode of the device at the other end of the cable.

The OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature can be configured as CHPID type OSC, OSD, OSE, or OSM. Non-QDIO operation mode requires CHPID type OSE.
