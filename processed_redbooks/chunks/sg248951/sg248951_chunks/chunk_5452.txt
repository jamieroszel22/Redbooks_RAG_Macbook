4.5.2  Physical channel ID report

A physical channel ID (PCHID) reflects the physical location of a channel-type interface. A PCHID number is based on the following factors:

- /SM590000 PCIe+ I/O drawer location
- /SM590000 Channel feature slot number
- /SM590000 Port number of the channel feature

A CHPID does not directly correspond to a hardware channel port. Instead, it is assigned to a PCHID in the hardware configuration definition (HCD) or IOCP.

A PCHID REPORT is created for each new build server and for upgrades on servers. The report lists all I/O features that are installed, the physical slot location, and the assigned PCHID. A portion of a sample PCHID REPORT is shown in Example 4-2.
