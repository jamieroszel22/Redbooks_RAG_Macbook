e hardware the beginning and end of a group of instructions that must be treated in an atomic way. All of their results occur or none occur, in true transactional style. The execution is optimistic.

The hardware provides a memory area to record the original contents of affected registers and memory as instruction execution occurs. If the transactional execution group is canceled or must be rolled back, the hardware transactional memory is used to reset the values. Software can implement a fallback capability.

This capability increases the software's efficiency by providing a way to avoid locks (lock elision). This advantage is of special importance for speculative code generation and highly parallelized applications.

TX is used by IBM Java virtual machine (JVM) and might be used by other software. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.
