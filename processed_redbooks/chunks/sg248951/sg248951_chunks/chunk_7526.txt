specially for smaller structures, because of task-related memory increases that are associated with the increased number of CF tasks in CFLEVEL 25

Review the CF LPAR size by using the CFSizer tool.

Alternatively, the batch SIZER utility also can be used for re-sizing your CF structures as needed. Make sure to update CFRM Policy INITISIZE or SIZE values as needed.
