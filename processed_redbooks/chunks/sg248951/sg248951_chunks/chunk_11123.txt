mpression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations.

Compression modes

Compression is run in one of the following modes:

- /SM590000 Synchronous

Execution occurs in problem state where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space.

- /SM590000 Asynchronous

Execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution.

This type of execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for authorized users of zEDC.

Note: The zEDC Express feature does not carry forward to IBM z16.

IBM z16 migration considerations

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC is fully compatible with zEDC. Data that is compressed by zEDC can be read by IBM z16 (the on-chip) NXU and vice versa.

All z/OS configurations stay the same
