10.3.1  Hardware Management Appliance connectivity

On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the HMA FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the A frame. Stand-alone HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) can no longer be ordered.

With IBM z16 and HMA, the SE code runs virtualized on the two integrated HMCs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. One SE is the Primary SE (active) and the other is the Alternative SE (backup).

With the HMA, each HMC and each SE has its own two physical Ethernet RJ45 ports, as shown in Figure 10-17. The red lines highlights the Ethernet connectivity for the SEs; the green lines highlight the HMCs.
