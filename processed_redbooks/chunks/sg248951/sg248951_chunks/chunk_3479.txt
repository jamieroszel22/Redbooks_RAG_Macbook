z16, PR/SM tries to allocate memory into a single CPC drawer. If memory does not fit into a single drawer, PR/SM tries to allocate the memory into the CPC drawer with the most processor entitlement.

The PR/SM memory and logical processor resources allocation goal is to place all partition resources on a single CPC drawer, if possible. The resources, such as memory and logical processors, are assigned to the logical partitions at the time of their activation. Later on, when all partitions are activated, PR/SM can move memory between CPC drawers to benefit the performance of each LPAR, without operating system knowledge. This process was done on the previous families of IBM Z servers only for PUs that use PR/SM dynamic PU reallocation.

With IBM z16 servers, this process occurs whenever the configuration changes, such as in the following circumstances:
