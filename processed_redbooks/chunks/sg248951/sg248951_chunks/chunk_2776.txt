cessor chip of the IBM Telum microprocessor. IBM z16 On-Chip Compression delivers industry-leading throughput and replaces the zEDC Express PCIe adapter available on the IBM z14 and earlier servers.

One Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU) is used per processor chip, which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Brand new concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest
- /SM590000 Supports DEFLATE compliant compression/decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler
- /SM590000 Low latency
- /SM590000 High bandwidth
- /SM590000 Problem state execution
- /SM590000 Hardware/Firmware interlocks to ensure system responsiveness
- /SM590000 Designed instruction
- /SM590000 Run in millicode

The On-Chip Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processors chip; therefore, it is available to all LPARs and guests.
