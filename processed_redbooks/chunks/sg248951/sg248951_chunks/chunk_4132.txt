ure, and starts to selectively queue and throttle incoming requests to the CF, on a structure-specific basis while other requests for other 'nonmonopolizing' structures and workloads are unaffected.

z/OS dynamically manages the queue of requests for the 'monopolizing' structures to limit the number of active CF requests (parallelism) to them. It monitors the monopolization state information of the CF to observe the structure becoming 'nonmonopolized' again so that request processing can eventually revert to a nonthrottled mode of operation.

The overall goal of z/OS anti-monopolization support is to protect the ability of ALL well-behaved structures and workloads to access the CF, and get their requests processed in the CF in a timely fashion while implementing queuing and throttling mechanisms in z/OS to hold back the specific abusive workloads that are causing problems for other workloads.

z/OS XCF/XES use APAR support is required to provide this function.
