EX6S).
- c. More than one partition, which is defined to the same channel subsystem (CSS) or to different CSSs, can use the same domain number when assigned to different PCIe cryptographic adapters.

The concept of dedicated processor does not apply to the PCIe cryptographic adapter. Whether configured as a coprocessor or an accelerator, the PCIe cryptographic adapter is made available to an LPAR. It is made available as directed by the domain assignment and the candidate list in the LPAR image profile. This availability is not changed by the shared or dedicated status that is given to the PUs in the partition.
