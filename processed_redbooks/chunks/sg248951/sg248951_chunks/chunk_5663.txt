xpress feature occupies one I/O slot in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. Each feature includes two ports, each supporting an LC Duplex connector, with one PCHID and one CHPID that is associated with each port.

Each FICON Express feature uses SFP (SFP+ for FICON Express16SA and FICON Express32S) optics that allow for concurrent repairing or replacement for each SFP. The data flow on the unaffected channels on the same feature can continue. A problem with one FICON Express port does not require replacement of a complete feature.

Each FICON Express feature also supports cascading, which is the connection of two FICON Directors in succession. This configuration minimizes the number of cross-site connections and helps reduce implementation costs for disaster recovery applications, IBM Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS), and remote copy.

IBM z16 servers support 32 K devices per FICON channel for all FICON features.
