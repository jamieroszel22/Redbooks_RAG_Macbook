ion Processor (zIIP), integrated firmware processor (IFP), or system assist processor (SAP) fails. Transparent sparing for failed processors is supported and sparing is supported across the drawers.

- /SM590000 Application preservation

This function is used when a PU fails and no spares are available. The state of the failing PU is passed to another active PU, where the operating system uses it to successfully resume the task (in most cases, without customer intervention).

- /SM590000 Cooling change

The IBM z16 air-cooled configuration includes a front-to-rear radiator cooling system. The radiator pumps, blowers, controls, and sensors are N+1 redundant. In normal operation, one active pump supports the system. A second pump is turned on and the original pump is turned off periodically, which improves reliability of the pumps. The replacement of pumps or blowers is concurrent with no effect on performance.

Note: Customer chilled water (WCU) is not offered on IBM z16.
