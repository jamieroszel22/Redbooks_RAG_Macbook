e 'record data entries' to recover from being out of record data entries.

CFCC level 25 on IBM z16 is providing improved use support for handling of lock structure 'record data full' conditions by:

- -Thresholding record data structure full conditions to occur when less than 100% full, reserving a special 'for emergency use only' pool of record data entries for critical recovery purposes (user-specified threshold)
- -Providing new APIs that allow exploiters to make use of this new reserved pool only when needed for recovery actions, but not for normal database locking purposes

z/OS APAR OA60650 and VSAM RLS APAR OA62059 are required in z/OS V2R3, V2R4, and V2R5.

- /SM590000 DYNDISP=ON|OFF is deprecated on IBM z16, keeping only THIN option for shared-engine CF images.
