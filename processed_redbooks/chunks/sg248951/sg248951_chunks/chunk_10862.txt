y are run interacts with the design of a microprocessor to affect a performance component. This factor is defined as instruction complexity . The following design alternatives affect this component:

- /SM590000 Cycle time (GHz)
- /SM590000 Instruction architecture
- /SM590000 Pipeline
- /SM590000 Superscalar
- /SM590000 Out-of-order execution
- /SM590000 Branch prediction
- /SM590000 Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)
- /SM590000 Transactional Execution (TX)
- /SM590000 Single instruction multiple data instruction set (SIMD)
- /SM590000 Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) 5

As workloads are moved between microprocessors with various designs, performance varies. However, when on a processor, this component tends to be similar across all models of that processor.
