5.1  Channel subsystem

Channel subsystem (CSS) is a collective name of facilities that IBM Z servers use to control I/O operations.

The channel subsystem directs the flow of information between I/O devices and main storage. It allows data processing to proceeded concurrently with I/O processing, which relieves data processors (central processor (CP) and Integrated Facility for Linux [IFL]) of the task of communicating directly with I/O devices.

The channel subsystem includes subchannels, I/O devices that are attached through control units, and channel paths between the subsystem and control units. For more information about the channel subsystem, see 5.1.1, 'Multiple logical channel subsystems'.
