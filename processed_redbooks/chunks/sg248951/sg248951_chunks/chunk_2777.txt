The On-Chip Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processors chip; therefore, it is available to all LPARs and guests.

Moving the compression function from the I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly on L2 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O.

Data compression is running in one of the two execution modes available: Synchronous mode or Asynchronous mode:

- /SM590000 Synchronous execution occurs in problem states where the user application starts the instruction in its virtual address space.
- /SM590000 Asynchronous execution is optimized for Large Operations under z/OS for authorized applications (for example, BSAM/QSAM) and issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution.

Asynchronous execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for existing authorized users of zEDC.
