- /SM590000 The dedicated L2 cache (dense SRAM) is semi-private to the core; that is, each core features an associated 32-MB slice of the L2 cache (semi-private):
- -Virtual L3 on PU Chip (shared victim 256 MB)
- -Virtual L4 on drawer up to 2 GB
- /SM590000 L2 cache and L2 cache recovery:
- -The L2 cache includes expected inline Symbol ECC (RAID4) recovery:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; 64:1 interleaving (4:1 physical, 16:1 logical)
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; L2 symbol ECC is inherited by virtual L3 and virtual L4
- -The array macro includes row and column repair (module manufacturing and ABIST)
- -Ring can be fenced from L2 for yield and fences core (module manufacturing):
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; If the core checkstops, all 32 MB can be used by the system
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; L2 dedicated and shared split are managed in the LRU logic
- -Dynamic macro sparing: Four spare macros, one spare for each quarter slice
