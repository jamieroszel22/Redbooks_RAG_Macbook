4.3  PCIe+ I/O drawer

The PCIe+ I/O drawers (see Figure 4-1) are attached to the CPC drawer through a PCIe cable and use PCIe Gen3 as the infrastructure bus within the drawer. The PCIe Gen3 I/O bus infrastructure data rate is up to 16 GBps.

<!-- missing-text -->

PCIe switch application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are used to fan out the host bus from the CPC drawer through the PCIe+ I/O drawer to the individual I/O features. Maximum 16 PCIe I/O features (up to 32 channels) per PCIe+ I/O drawer are supported.
