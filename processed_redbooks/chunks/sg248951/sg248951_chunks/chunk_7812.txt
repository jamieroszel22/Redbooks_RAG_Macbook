Large send for IPv6 packets improves performance by offloading outbound TCP segmentation processing from the host to an OSA-Express feature by using a more efficient memory transfer into it.

Large send support for IPv6 packets applies to the OSA-Express7S 1.2, OSA-Express7S, and OSA-Express6S 11  features (CHPID type OSD) on IBM z16, IBM z15, and IBM z14.

OSA-Express6S added TCP checksum on large send, which reduces the cost (CPU time) of error detection for large send.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA Dynamic LAN idle

The OSA Dynamic LAN idle parameter helps reduce latency and improve performance by dynamically adjusting the inbound blocking algorithm. System administrators can authorize the TCP/IP stack to enable a dynamic setting that previously was static.

The blocking algorithm is modified based on the following application requirements:
