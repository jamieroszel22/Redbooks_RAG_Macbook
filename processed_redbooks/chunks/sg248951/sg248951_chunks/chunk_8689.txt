 Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 is only needed if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade optional feature is offered with IBM z16 A01 to provide more capacity for System Recovery Boost processing. For example, if a z/OS operating system change requires a sequence of system shutdowns and restarts, and these procedures can benefit from extra CPU capacity, the System Recovery Boost record can be used to activate more zIIPs on the server at the commencement of the change window. These zIIPs are used by the z/OS systems to run general CP work during the boost periods.

The System Recovery Boost Upgrade requires the following feature codes:

- /SM590000 FC 6802: System Recovery Boost Record
