ociated with temporary hardware capacity, IBM software, and IBM maintenance. The test can be used to validate the processes to download, stage, install, activate, and deactivate On/Off CoD capacity.

This test can have a maximum duration of 24 hours, which commences upon the activation of any capacity resource that is contained in the On/Off CoD record. Activation levels of capacity can change during the 24-hour test period. The On/Off CoD test automatically stops at the end of the 24-hour period.

You also can perform administrative testing. Although capacity is not added to the system, you can test all of the procedures and automation for the management of the On/Off CoD facility.

An example of an On/Off CoD order on the Resource Link web page is shown in Figure 8-11.
