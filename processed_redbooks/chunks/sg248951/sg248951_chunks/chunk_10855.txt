 since z/OS V1R11 LSPR. The use of the same scaling factor across LSPR releases minimizes the changes in capacity results for an older study and provides more accurate capacity view for a new study.

Performance data for IBM z16 servers were obtained with z/OS V2R4 (running Db2 for z/OS V12, CICS TS V5R3, IMS V14, Enterprise COBOL V6R2, and WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V9.0.0.8). All IBM Z server generations are measured in the same environment with the same workloads at high usage.

Note: If your software configuration is different from what is described here, the performance results might vary.

On average, IBM z16 servers can deliver up to 17% more performance in a 200-way configuration than an IBM z15 190 -way. However, the observed performance increase varies depending on the workload type.
