pping is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) value that is not affected by changes to the virtual or physical configuration of the system.

Absolute capping provides an optional maximum capacity setting for logical partitions that is specified in the absolute processors capacity (for example, 5.00 CPs or 2.75 IFLs). This setting is specified independently by processor type (namely CPs, zIIPs, and IFLs) and provides an enforceable upper limit on the amount of the specified processor type that can be used in a partition.

Absolute capping is ideal for processor types and operating systems that the z/OS WLM cannot control. Absolute capping is not intended as a replacement for defined capacity or group capacity for z/OS, which are managed by WLM.
