for I/O domains within the PCIe+ I/O drawer.

Note: The PCIe fan-out is used exclusively for I/O and cannot be shared for any other purpose.

4.4.2  Integrated Coupling Adapter (FC 0172 and FC 0176)

The IBM ICA SR (FC 0172) is a two-port fan-out feature that is used for short distance coupling connectivity and uses channel type CS5. For IBM z16, the new build feature is ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176).

The ICA SR (FC 0172) and ICA SR1.1 (FC 0176) use PCIe Gen3 technology, with x16 lanes that are bifurcated into x8 lanes for coupling.

Both cards are designed to drive distances up to 150 meters (492 feet) with a link data rate of 8 GBps. ICA SR supports up to four channel-path identifiers (CHPIDs) per port and eight subchannels (devices) per CHPID.

The coupling links can be defined as shared between images (z/OS) within a CSS. They also can be spanned across multiple CSSs in a CPC. For ICA SR features, a maximum four CHPIDs per port can be defined.
