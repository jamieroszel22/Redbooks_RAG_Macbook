 previous IBM Z server generations, specific configurations that use Bulk Power Adapter (BPA) with IBF can sense an 'operating on battery condition' if a power interruption occurs on any power cord.

For STP, if CPC1 (Primary Time Server and Current Time Server) senses a shift to an on-battery power condition, a signal indicating potential imminent server disruption of CPC1 is sent to CPC2 (the Backup Time Server).

If within 30 seconds the BTS (CPC2) does not receive a signal that power is back to fully redundant on CPC1, CPC2 takes over as CTS. After normal power is restored to CPC1, CPC1 can automatically return to the CTS role.

With IBM z16, the IBF was discontinued. As such, Coupling Facility Nonvolatility requires Room-level, Row-level, or System-Level UPS for protecting against power failures.
