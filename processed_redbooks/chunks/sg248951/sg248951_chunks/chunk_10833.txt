11.2.3  Cooling requirements

The IBM z16 cooling system is manufactured as a radiator (air) cooled system. The dual chip modules (DCMs) are cooled with an internal water loop. The liquid in the internal water circuit is cooled by using a radiator. I/O drawers, PCIe I/O drawers, power enclosures, and CPC drawers are cooled by chilled air with blowers.

The IBM z16 servers include a recommended (long-term) ambient temperature range of 18°C (64.4°F) - 27°C (80.6°F). The minimum allowed ambient temperature is 5°C (41°F); the maximum allowed temperature is 40°C (104°F).
