 primary CF updates. It offers performance advantages for duplexing lock structures and avoids the need for synchronous communication delays during the processing of every duplexed update operation.

Asynchronous CF Duplexing for lock structures requires the following software support:

- /SM590000 z/OS V2R5, V2R4
- /SM590000 z/OS V2R3 with PTFs for APAR OA47796 and OA49148
- /SM590000 z/VM V7R3, V7R2 or V7R1
- /SM590000 Db2 V12 with PTFs for APAR PI66689
- /SM590000 IRLM V2.R3 with PTFs for APAR PI68378

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-5 on page 256.

Asynchronous cross-invalidate for CF cache structures

Asynchronous cross-invalidate (XI) for CF cache structures enables improved efficiency in CF data sharing by adopting a more transactional behavior for cross-invalidate (XI) processing. This processing is used to maintain coherency and consistency of data managers' local buffer pools across the sysplex.
