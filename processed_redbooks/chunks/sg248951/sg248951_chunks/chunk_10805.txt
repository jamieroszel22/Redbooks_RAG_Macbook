The system then obtains the name of the user ID template from content in the LDAP server schema data.

Default HMC user IDs

For HMC V2.16.0 the default user IDs are limited to ACSADMIN and SERVICE.

ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG default users are no longer shipped. Default user roles for ADVANCED, OPERATOR, STORAGEADMIN, and SYSPROG are provided, and user IDs can be created from those roles.

Any default user IDs that are part of a previous HMC level can be carried forward to new HMC levels as part of a MES Upgrade or by way of selecting User Profile Data for the Save/Restore Customizable Console Data or Configure Data Replication tasks.
