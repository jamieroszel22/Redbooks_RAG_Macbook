s, LPAR configuration, and the software configuration that is running. CPU MF data can be collected by z/OS System Measurement Facility on SMF 113 records or by z/VM Monitor starting with z/VM V5R4.

12.6  Relating production workloads to LSPR workloads

Historically, the following techniques were used to match production workloads to LSPR workloads:

- /SM590000 Application name (a client that is running CICS can use the CICS LSPR workload)
- /SM590000 Application type (create a mix of the LSPR online and batch workloads)
- /SM590000 I/O rate (the low I/O rates that are used a mix of low I/O rate LSPR workloads)

The IBM z Processor Capacity Reference (IBM zPCR) tool supports the following workload categories:

- /SM590000 Low
- /SM590000 Low-Average
- /SM590000 Average
- /SM590000 Average-high
- /SM590000 High
