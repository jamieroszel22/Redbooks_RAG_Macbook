12.1  IBM z16 performance characteristics

The IBM z16 Model A01 Feature Max200 (7K0) is designed to offer up to 17% more capacity compared to an IBM z15 Model T01 (7H0) system.

Uniprocessor performance also increased. On average, an IBM z16 model 701 offers performance improvements almost 10% over the IBM z15 Model 701. Figure 12-1 shows a system performance comparison of successive IBM Z servers.

12.1.1  IBM z16 single-thread capacity

Note: The acronym PCI stands for Processor Capacity Index .

Operating system support varies for the number of 'engines' that are supported.

The IBM z16 processor chip runs at 5.2 GHz clock speed, which is the same as the IBM z15 processor chip, but the performance is increased. For N-way processors model, it increases 1.11x on average at equal N-way configuration.
