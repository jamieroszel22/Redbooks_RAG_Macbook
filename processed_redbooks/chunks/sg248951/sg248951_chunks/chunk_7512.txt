ata). Data that is compressed and written with zEDC can be read and decompressed by IBM z16 well into the future.

The on-chip compression unit has the following operating modes:

- /SM590000 Synchronous execution in Problem State, where user application starts instruction in its virtual address space. This mode provides low latency and high-bandwidth compression and decompression operations. It does not require any special hypervisor support, which removes the virtualization layer (sharing the zEDC Express PCIe adapter among LPARs requires virtualization support).
- /SM590000 Asynchronous optimization for Large Operations under z/OS. The authorized application (for example, BSAM/QSAM) issues I/O for asynchronous execution and SAP (PU) starts instruction (synchronously) on behalf of application. The on-chip accelerator enables load balancing of high compression loads and low latency and high bandwidth compared to zEDC Express, while maintaining current user experience on compression.
