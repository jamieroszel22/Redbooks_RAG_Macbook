Montgomery Modular Math Engine
- The Montgomery Modular Math Engine is a method for fast modular multiplication. Many crypto systems, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman key Exchange, can use this method.
- /SM590000 Clear Key Fast Path (Symmetric and Asymmetric)
- This mode of operation gives a direct hardware path to the cryptographic engine and provides high performance for public-key cryptographic functions.
- /SM590000 Random Number Generator (RNG)
- /SM590000 Prime Number Generator (PNG)

Several of these algorithms require a secure key and must run on an HSM. Some of these algorithms can also run with a clear key on the CPACF. Many standards are supported only when Crypto Express8S is running in CCA mode. Others are supported only when the adapter is running in EP11 mode.

The three modes for Crypto Express8S are described next. For more information, see 6.7, 'Cryptographic functions comparison' on page 242.
