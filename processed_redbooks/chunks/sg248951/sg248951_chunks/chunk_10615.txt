IBM HMC Mobile

IBM HMC Mobile is an iOS and Android application with which you can monitor all of your IBM Z systems and partitions. You also can receive alerts when messages or status changes occur.

You also can start, stop, or change the activation profile for a partition.

A full set of granular security controls is provided from the HMC, including MFA. This mobile interface is optional and is disabled by default. More functions from the HMC also are planned to be available on IBM HMC Mobile.
