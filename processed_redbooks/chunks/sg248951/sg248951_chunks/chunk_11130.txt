Compression acceleration and Linux on IBM Z

The zEDC I/O adapter use is limited in many Linux on IBM Z environments because SR-IOV does not provide a high degree of virtualization; therefore, the user must pick and choose which guests are granted access to the accelerator.

The IBM z16 On-Chip Compression accelerator solves these virtualization limitations because the function is no longer an I/O device and is available as a problem state instruction to all Linux on IBM Z guests without constraints.

This feature enables pervasive usage in highly virtualized environments.

IBM z16 On-Chip Compression is available to open source applications by way of zlib.
