The definition of LPAR name, MIF image ID, and LPAR ID are used to identify an LPAR by the channel subsystem to identify I/O functions from different LPARs of multiple LCSSs, which support the implementation of these dedicated, shared, and spanned paths.

An example of definition of these LPAR-related identifications is shown in Figure 5-4.

LPAR name

The LPAR name is defined as partition name parameter in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. The LPAR name must be unique across the server.

MIF image ID

The MIF image ID is defined as a parameter for each LPAR in the RESOURCE statement of an I/O configuration. It ranges 1 - F, and must be unique within an LCSS. However, duplicates are allowed in different LCSSs.
