nformation with a single CPU instruction.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. Operating System support includes the following features 6 :

- /SM590000 Enablement of vector registers.
- /SM590000 A math library with an optimized and tuned math function (Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem [MASS]) that can be used in place of some of the C standard math functions. It includes a SIMD vectorized and nonvectorized version.
- /SM590000 A specialized math library, which is known as Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (ATLAS), that is optimized for the hardware.
- /SM590000 IBM Language Environmentfi for C runtime function enablement for ATLAS.
- /SM590000 DBX to support the disassembly of the new vector instructions, and to display and set vector registers.
- /SM590000 XML SS exploitation to use new vector processing instructions to improve performance.
