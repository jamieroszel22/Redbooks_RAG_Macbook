ttempts to recover the error. If the second attempt is unsuccessful (that is, a permanent fault exists), a relocation process is started that restores the full capacity by moving work to another PU.

Relocation under hardware control is possible because the R-unit has the full designed state in its buffer. PU error detection and recovery are shown in Figure 3-17.

3.4.10  Branch prediction

Because of the ultra-high frequency of the PUs, the penalty for a wrongly predicted branch is high. Therefore, a multi-pronged strategy for branch prediction is implemented on each core based on gathered branch history that is combined with other prediction mechanisms.

The BHT (Branch History Table) implementation on processors provides a large performance improvement. Originally introduced on the IBM ES/9000 9021 in 1990, the BHT is continuously improved.
