 following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 AND FC 6804 are needed only if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.

IBM z16 servers continue to deliver robust server designs through new technologies, hardening innovative and classic redundancy. For more information, see Chapter 9, 'Reliability, availability, and serviceability' on page 379.

2.7  Connectivity

Connections to PCIe+ I/O drawers and Integrated Coupling Adapters are driven from the CPC drawer fan-out cards. These fan-outs are installed in the rear of the CPC drawer.

Figure 2-22 shows the location of the fan-out slots. Each slot is identified with a location code (label) of LGxx.

<!-- missing-text -->

Up to 12 PCIe fan-outs (LG01 - LG12) can be installed in each CPC drawer.

A fan-out can be repaired concurrently with the use of redundant I/O interconnect. For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.
