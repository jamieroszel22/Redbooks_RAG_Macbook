Considerations: Power consumption is lower in a normal ambient temperature room, and for configurations that feature a lesser number of I/O slots, smaller amount of memory, and fewer PUs.

Power estimation for any configuration, power source, and room condition can be obtained by using the power estimation tool that is available at the IBM Resource Link website (login required).

On the Resource Link page, click Tools â†’ Power and weight estimation .
