Out-of-order execution

Out-of-order (OOO) execution yields significant performance benefits for compute-intensive applications by reordering instruction execution, which allows later (newer) instructions to be run ahead of a stalled instruction, and reordering storage accesses and parallel storage accesses. OOO maintains good performance growth for traditional applications.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. For more information, see '3.4.3, 'Out-of-Order execution' on page 81.
