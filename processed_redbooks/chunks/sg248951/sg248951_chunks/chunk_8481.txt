- /SM590000 Analysis

In analysis mode, CPM processes capacity-provisioning policies and informs the operator when a provisioning or deprovisioning action is required according to policy criteria.

Also, the operator determines whether to ignore the information or to manually upgrade or downgrade the system by using the HMC, SE, or available CPM commands.

- /SM590000 Confirmation

In this mode, CPM processes capacity provisioning policies and interrogates the installed temporary offering records. Every action that is proposed by the CPM must be confirmed by the operator.

- /SM590000 Autonomic

This mode is similar to the confirmation mode, but no operator confirmation is required.

Several reports are available in all modes that contain information about the workload, provisioning status, and the rationale for provisioning guidelines. User interfaces are provided through the z/OS console and the CPMC application.
