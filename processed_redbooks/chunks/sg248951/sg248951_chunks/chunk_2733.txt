ailability and reliability. These goals are achieved with redundancy of critical elements and sparing components of a single system, and the clustering technology of the Parallel Sysplex environment.
- /SM590000 Have internal and external connectivity offerings, supporting open standards, such as Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP).
- /SM590000 Provide leading cryptographic performance. Every processor unit (PU) includes a dedicated and optimized CP Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF). Optional Crypto Express features with cryptographic coprocessors provide the highest standardized security certification. 1  These optional features also can be configured as Cryptographic Accelerators to enhance the performance of Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) transactions.
