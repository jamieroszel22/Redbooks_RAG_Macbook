- /SM590000 Six CSSs
- /SM590000 A total of 15 LPARs in each CSS0 to CSS4
- /SM590000 A total of 10 LPARs in CSS5
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 0 with 63.75 K devices in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 1 with 64 K minus one device in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 2 with 64 K minus one device in each CSS
- /SM590000 Subchannel set 3 with 64 K minus one device in each CSS
