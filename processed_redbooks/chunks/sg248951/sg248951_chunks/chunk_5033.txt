More PCIe+ I/O drawers can be installed concurrently if free frame slots for the PCIe+ I/O drawers and PCIe fan-outs in the CPC drawer are available.

- /SM590000 Dynamic I/O configuration

Dynamic I/O configuration supports the dynamic addition, removal, or modification of the channel path, control units, and I/O devices without a planned outage.

- /SM590000 Remote Dynamic I/O Activation

Remote dynamic I/O activation is supported for CPCs running Stand-alone CFs, Linux on Z and z/TPF. IBM z14 GA2 provided a remote Dynamic I/O capability for driving hardware-only I/O configuration changes from a 'driving' instance of z/OS Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) on one CPC to a remote 'target' standalone Coupling Facility CPC.

IBM z16 provides a supported capability to drive these same kinds of hardware-only changes from a driving z/OS HCD instance to a remote CPC which is not a standalone Coupling facility, but rather a CPC which hosts Linux on Z and /or z/TPF images.
