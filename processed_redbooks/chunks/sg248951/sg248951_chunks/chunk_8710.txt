lect the test option to start a 10-day test period. A standard contract allows one test per CBU year. However, you can order more tests in increments of one up to a maximum of 15 for each CBU order.

Tip: The CBU test activation is done the same way as the real activation; that is, by using the same SE Perform a Model Conversion window and selecting the Temporary upgrades option. The HMC windows were changed to avoid accidental real CBU activations by setting the test activation as the default option.

The test CBU must be deactivated in the same way as the regular CBU. Failure to deactivate the CBU feature before the expiration date can cause the system to degrade gracefully back to its original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines or the last in-use shared engine.
