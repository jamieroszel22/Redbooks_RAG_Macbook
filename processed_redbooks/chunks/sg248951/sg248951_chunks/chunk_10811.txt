10.5.14  Cryptographic support

This section describes the cryptographic management and control functions that are available in the HMC and SE.

Cryptographic hardware

IBM z16 systems include standard cryptographic hardware and optional cryptographic features for flexibility and growth capability.

The HMC/SE interface provides the following capabilities:

- /SM590000 Defining the cryptographic controls
- /SM590000 Dynamically adding a Crypto feature to a partition:
- -For the first time
- -That already uses Crypto
- /SM590000 Dynamically removing a Crypto feature from a partition
