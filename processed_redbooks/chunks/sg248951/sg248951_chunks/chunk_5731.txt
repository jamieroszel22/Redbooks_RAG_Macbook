Switch configuration for 10 GbE RoCE Express2.1: The 10 GbE switches must meet the following requirements:

- /SM590000 Global Pause function is enabled
- /SM590000 Priority flow control (PFC) is disabled

The maximum supported unrepeated distance, point-to-point, is 100 meters (328 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 10 GbE switch or to another 10 GbE RoCE Express3 SR feature:

- /SM590000 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 70 meters (229 feet)
- /SM590000 OM4 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 4700 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 100 meters (328 feet)
