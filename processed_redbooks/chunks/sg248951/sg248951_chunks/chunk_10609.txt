OS partitions where ISV does not support software capping

A group name, processor capping value, and partition membership are specified at the hardware console, along with the following properties:

- /SM590000 Set an absolute capacity cap by CPU type on a group of LPARs.
- /SM590000 Allow each of the partitions to use capacity up to their individual limits if the group's aggregate consumption does not exceed the group absolute capacity limit.
- /SM590000 Include updated SysEvent QVS support (used by vendors who implement software pricing).
- /SM590000 Only shared partitions are managed in these groups.
- /SM590000 Specify caps for one or more processor types in the group.
- /SM590000 Specify in absolute processor capacity (for example, 2.5 processors).
- /SM590000 Use Change LPAR Group Controls (as with windows that are used for software group-defined capacity), as shown in Figure 10-22.
