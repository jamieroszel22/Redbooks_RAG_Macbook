keys also can be used. On IBM z16, protected keys require a Crypto Express adapter that is running in CCA mode.

For more information, see 6.5.2, 'Crypto Express8S as a CCA coprocessor' on page 228.

The hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, are enabled on all systems and do not require the CPACF enablement feature. For all other algorithms, the no-charge CPACF enablement feature (FC 3863) is required.

The CPACF functions are implemented as processor instructions and require operating system support for use. Operating systems that use the CPACF instructions include z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on IBM Z.

6.4.2  CPACF protected key

IBM z16 supports the protected key implementation. Secure keys are processed on the PCIeCC adapters (HSMs) 3 . This process requires an asynchronous operation to move the data and keys from the general-purpose central processor (CP) to the crypto adapters.
