ICCC provides for system upgrades without hardware changes by activating extra (physically installed) unused capacity. Concurrent upgrades through LICCC can be performed for the following resources:

- /SM590000 Processors, such as CPs, ICFs, z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs), IFLs, and SAPs, if unused PUs are available on the installed processor drawers, or if the model capacity identifier for the CPs can be increased.
