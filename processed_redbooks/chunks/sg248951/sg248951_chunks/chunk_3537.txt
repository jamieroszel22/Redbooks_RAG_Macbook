ispatch manages the number of logical CPs in use. It adjusts the number of logical processors within an LPAR to achieve the optimal balance between CP resources and the requirements of the workload.

HiperDispatch also adjusts the number of logical processors. The goal is to map the logical processor to as few physical processors as possible. This configuration uses the processor resources more efficiently by trying to stay within the local cache structure. Doing so makes efficient use of the advantages of the high-frequency microprocessors, and improves throughput and response times.
