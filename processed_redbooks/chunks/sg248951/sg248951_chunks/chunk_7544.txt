r limit on multi-track operations was removed by z196. This improvement allows the channel to fully use the bandwidth of FICON channels, which results in higher throughputs and lower response times.

The multi-track operations extension applies to the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+, when configured as CHPID type FC and connecting to z/OS. zHPF requires matching support by the DS8000 series. Otherwise, the extended multi-track support is transparent to the control unit.

zHPF is enhanced to allow all large write operations (greater than 64 KB) at distances up to 100 km (62.13 miles) to be run in a single round trip to the control unit. This process does not elongate the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances. This enhancement to zHPF removes a key inhibitor for customers that are adopting zHPF over extended distances, especially when the IBM HyperSwap capability of z/OS is used.
