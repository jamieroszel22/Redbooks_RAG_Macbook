The System Recovery Boost Upgrade requires the following feature codes:

- /SM590000 FC 6802: System Recovery Boost Record

This feature code provides extra zIIP capacity (20 zIIP records for 1 - 5 years, orderable by FC 6799, and must be renewed if expired) for use in System Recovery Boost events (shutdown, restart/IPL, and stand-alone memory dumps).

Note: At least one permanent zIIP record must be present for ordering System Recovery Boost Upgrade (FC 6802).

- /SM590000 FC 9930: Boost Authorization contract

This code enables the ordering of On/Off CoD for System Recovery Boost through Resource Link.
