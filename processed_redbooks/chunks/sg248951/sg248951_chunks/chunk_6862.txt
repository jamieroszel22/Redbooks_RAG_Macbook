ch ICSF instance sees a logical cryptographic coprocessor that consists of the physical cryptographic engine and the unique set of registers (the domain) that is allocated to this logical partition.

The installation of CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) DES/TDES enablement (FC 3863) is required to use the Crypto Express7S feature.

Each Crypto Express8S FC 0908 includes two IBM 4770 PCIe Cryptographic Coprocessors (PCIeCC), which is a hardware security module (HSM); FC 0909 includes one IBM 4770 PCIeCC. The adapters are available in the following configurations:

- /SM590000 IBM Enterprise Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) Coprocessor (CEX8C)
- /SM590000 IBM Enterprise Public Key Cryptography Standards #11 (PKCS) Coprocessor (CEX8P)
- /SM590000 IBM Crypto Express7S Accelerator (CEX8A)

During the feature installation, the PCI-X adapter is configured by default as the CCA coprocessor.
