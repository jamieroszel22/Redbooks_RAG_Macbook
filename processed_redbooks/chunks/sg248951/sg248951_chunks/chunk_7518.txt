/SM590000 CFCC Message Path Resiliency

CF Message Paths use a z/OS-provided system identifier (SYID) to uniquely identify which z/OS system image (and instance of that system image) is sending requests over a message path to the CF. With IBM z15, we are providing a new resiliency mechanism that transparently recovers for this 'missing' message path deactivate (if and when that deactivation ever occurs).

During path initialization, the CF provides more information to z/OS about every message path that appears active, including the SYID for the path. Whenever z/OS interrogates the state of the message paths to the CF, z/OS checks this SYID information for currency and correctness, and if incorrect, gather diagnostic information and reactivates the path to correct the problem.
