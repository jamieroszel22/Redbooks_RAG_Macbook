 monitors the workload on a set of z/OS systems and organizes the provisioning of extra capacity to these systems when required. You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file.

The details of extra capacity and the rules for its provisioning are stored in a policy file. These two files are created and maintained through the Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC).

The operational flow of Capacity Provisioning is shown in Figure 8-13 on page 360.

The z/OS WLM manages the workload by goals and business importance on each z/OS system. WLM metrics are available through existing interfaces, and are reported through IBM Resource Measurement Facility (RMF) Monitor III, with one RMF gatherer for each z/OS system.

Sysplex-wide data aggregation and propagation occur in the RMF Distributed Data Server (DDS). The RMF Common Information Model (CIM) providers and associated CIM models publish the RMF Monitor III data.
