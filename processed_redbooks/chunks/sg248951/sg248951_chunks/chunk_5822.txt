ting an I/O operation.

The device number provides a means to identify a device that is independent of any limitations that are imposed by the system model, configuration, or channel-path protocols.

A device number also can be used to designate an I/O function to a specific I/O device. Because it is an arbitrary number, it can easily be fit into any configuration management and operating management scenarios. For example, a system administrator can set all of the z/OS systems in an environment to device number 1000 for their system RES volumes.

With multiple subchannel sets, a subchannel is assigned to a specific I/O device by the channel subsystem with an automatically assigned subchannel number and a device number that is defined by user. An I/O device can always be identified by an SSID with a subchannel number or a device number. For example, a device with device number AB00 of subchannel set 1 can be designated as 1AB00.
