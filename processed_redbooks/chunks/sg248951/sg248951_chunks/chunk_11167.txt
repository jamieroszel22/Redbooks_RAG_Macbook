ed Fit Pricing for IBM Z hardware in more detail

Tailored Fit Pricing (TFP)-Hardware pricing includes two aspects: a Subscription charge, and a Usage charge (see Figure D-2).

<!-- missing-text -->

One of the most important facts about TFP-Hardware is that a single system or central processing complex (CPC) always is considered. It is on this level that use is measured. The blue bars that are shown in Figure D-2 represent individual 15-minute intervals, and the use is measured in each one.

In Figure D-2, the dark green line shows the average use of the machine over the entire period that is measure (normally a month). The black line shows the Rolling 4 Hour Average (R4HA), and it is displayed for information purposes only because the R4HA is not used for TFP-Hardware calculations.

The red line is the customer owned capacity (or Base capacity). The light green line shows the activated capacity of the machine, as reported by Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT).
