A resource group (RG) parameter also is shown in the PCHID REPORT for native PCIe features. A balanced plugging of native PCIe features exists between four resource groups (RG1, RG2, RG3, and RG4).

The preassigned PCHID number of each I/O port relates directly to its physical location (jack location in a specific slot).

4.6  Connectivity

I/O channels are part of the CSS. They provide connectivity for data exchange between servers, between servers and external control units (CUs) and devices, or between networks.

For more information about connectivity to external I/O subsystems (for example, disks), see 4.6.2, 'Storage connectivity' on page 165.

For more information about communication to LANs, see 4.6.3, 'Network connectivity' on page 173.

Communication between servers is implemented by using CE LR, ICA SR, or channel-to-channel (FICON CTC) connections. For more information, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187.
