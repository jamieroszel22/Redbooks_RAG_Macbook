The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature (FC 0451) provides a low latency direct connection between IBM z16 and DS8000 storage system.

The zHyperLink Express1.1 is the result of new business requirements that demand fast and consistent application response times. It dramatically reduces latency by interconnecting the IBM z16 directly to I/O Bay of the DS8k by using PCIe Gen3 x 8 physical link (up to 150 meters [492 feet]). A new transport protocol is defined for reading and writing IBM CKD data records 9 , as documented in the zHyperLink interface specification.

On IBM z16, zHyperLink Express1.1 card is a PCIe Gen3 adapter, which installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. HCD definition support was added for new PCIe function type with PORT attributes.

Requirements of zHyperLink Express1.1

The zHyperLink Express1.1 feature is available on IBM z16 servers, and includes the following requirements:
