PC drawer power

The power for the CPC drawer is a new design. It uses the following combinations of PSUs, Points of Load (POLs), Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs), and Processor Power Control Cards:

- /SM590000 PSUs: Provide AC to 12 V DC bulk or standby power and are installed at the rear of the CPC. The quantity that is installed depends on the following configurations:
- -Three PSUs for configurations that use BPA power
- -Four PSUs for configurations that use PDU power
- /SM590000 POLs: Seven Point of Load N+2 Redundant cards are installed next to the Memory DIMMs.

- /SM590000 VRMs: seven Voltage Regulator Modules (N+2 redundancy).
- /SM590000 Processor Power Control Card (PPC): Redundant processor power and control cards connect to the CPC trail board. The control function is powered from 12 V standby that is provided by the PSU. The PPC card also includes pressure, temperature, and humidity sensors.
