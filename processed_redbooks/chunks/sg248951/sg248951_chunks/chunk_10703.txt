10.5.8  Server Time Protocol support

Important: The Sysplex Time task on the SE was discontinued with IBM z15. Therefore, an HMC with Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 is required to access the Manage System Time task for IBM z16 A01, IBM z15 T01, and IBM z15 T02 CPCs.

IBM z16 implements the following major enhancements in support of the Server Time Protocol function:

- /SM590000 CPC direct Ethernet connectivity for the external time source (ETS)
- In previous generation IBM Z, the ETS for the STP was provided by connecting the Support element to the client network.
