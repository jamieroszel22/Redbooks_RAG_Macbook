ranch is essential for successful parallel execution of an instruction stream.

IBM z16 integrates a new branch prediction design that uses SRAM and supports the following enhancements over IBM z15:

- /SM590000 BTB1: 8 K - 12 K
- /SM590000 BTB2: up to 260 K
- /SM590000 TAGE PHT: 4 k x 2
- /SM590000 TAGE CTB: 1 k x 2

3.4.11  Wild branch

When a bad pointer is used or when code overlays a data area that contains a pointer to code, a random branch is the result. This process causes a 0C1 or 0C4 abend. Random branches are difficult to diagnose because clues about how the system got to that point are not evident.

With the wild branch hardware facility, the last address from which a successful branch instruction was run is kept. z/OS uses this information with debugging aids, such as the SLIP command, to determine from where a wild branch came.
