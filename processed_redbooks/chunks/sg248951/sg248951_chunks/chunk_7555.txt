ired, which produces less than optimal I/O performance. Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here.

VSAM and non-VSAM (DSORG=PS) sets can be defined as EF data sets. For non-VSAM data sets, a 32-byte suffix is appended to the end of every physical record (that is, block) on disk. VSAM appends the suffix to the end of every control interval (CI), which normally corresponds to a physical record.

A 32 K CI is split into two records to span tracks. This suffix is used to improve data reliability, and facilitates other functions that are described next. For example, if the DCB BLKSIZE or VSAM CI size is equal to 8192, the block on storage consists of 8224 bytes. The control unit does not distinguish between suffixes and user data. The suffix is transparent to the access method and database.

In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following functions:
