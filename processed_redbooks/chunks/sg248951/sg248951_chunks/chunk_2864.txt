n the system is PORed
- /SM590000 At the time of a concurrent upgrade
- /SM590000 As a result of adding PUs during a CBU
- /SM590000 Following a capacity on-demand upgrade through On/Off CoD or CIU.

PUs are removed from their pools when a concurrent downgrade occurs as the result of the removal of a CBU. They also are removed through the On/Off CoD process and the conversion of a PU. When a dedicated LPAR is activated, its PUs are taken from the correct pools. This process also is the case when an LPAR logically configures a PU as on, if the width of the pool allows for it.

For an LPAR, logical PUs are dispatched from the supporting pool only. The logical CPs are dispatched from the CP pool, logical zIIPs from the zIIP pool, logical IFLs from the IFL pool, and the logical ICFs from the ICF pool.
