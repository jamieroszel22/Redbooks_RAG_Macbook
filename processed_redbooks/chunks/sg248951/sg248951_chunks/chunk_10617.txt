 certificate that is returned by the 3270 server when a secure and encrypted SSL connection is established to an IBM host. This 3270 Emulator with encrypted connection is also known as Secure 3270 .

Use the Certificate Management feature if the certificates that are returned by the 3270 server are not signed by a well-known trusted certificate authority (CA) certificate, such as VeriSign or Geotrust. An advanced action within the Certificate Management task, Manage Trusted Signing Certificates, is used to add trusted signing certificates.

For example, if the certificate that is associated with the 3270 server on the IBM host is signed and issued by a corporate certificate, it must be imported, as shown in Figure 10-24.

The import from the remote server option can be used if the connection between the console and the IBM host can be trusted when the certificate is imported, as shown in Figure 10-25. Otherwise, import the certificate by using removable media.
