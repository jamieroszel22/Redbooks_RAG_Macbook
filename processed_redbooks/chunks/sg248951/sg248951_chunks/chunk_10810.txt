10.5.13  Automated operations

As an alternative to manual operations, an application can interact with the HMC and SE through an API. The interface allows a program to monitor and control the hardware components of the system in the same way a user performs these tasks.

On IBM z16, the HMC APIs provide monitoring and control functions through SNMP. The API can get and set a managed object's attributes, issue commands, receive asynchronous notifications, and generate SNMP traps.

The older system, such as IBM z13's HMC, supports the CIM as an extra systems management API. Starting with IBM z14, the CIM support is removed.

For more information about APIs, see SNMP Application Programming Interfaces , SB10-7179.
