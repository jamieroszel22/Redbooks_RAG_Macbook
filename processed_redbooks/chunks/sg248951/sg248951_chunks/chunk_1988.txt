Memory allowed upgrades for Max200 models

Once a model Max200 is shipped, then the memory upgrades via MES are limited dependent on what configuration exists in the installed CPC drawers.

- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG numbers 22 to 33 (see Table 2-8 on page 39) then the max memory configuration for that CPC drawer is 33
- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG number 34, then the max memory configuration for that CPC drawer is 34
- /SM590000 If a CPC drawer is plugged with CFG number 35, then it's maxed out anyway.
