The CPM operates based on Workload Manager (WLM) indications, and the construct that is used is the Performance Index (PI) of a service class period. It is important to select service class periods that are suitable for the business application that needs more capacity.

Therefore, it is important to consider which workloads to control and which service class periods to specify.
