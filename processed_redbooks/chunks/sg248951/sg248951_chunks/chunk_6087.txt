 use distinct functions for encryption and decryption, only one function is used in asymmetric algorithms. Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data.

Asymmetric algorithms are also known as public key algorithms .

Asymmetric algorithms use complex calculations and are relatively slow (about 100 - 1000 times slower than symmetric algorithms). Therefore, such algorithms are not used for the encryption of bulk data.

Because the private key is never exchanged between the parties in communication, they are less vulnerable than symmetric algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms mainly are used for authentication, digital signatures, and for the encryption and exchange of secret keys, which in turn are used to encrypt bulk data with a symmetric algorithm.

Examples for asymmetric algorithms are RSA and the elliptic curve algorithms.
