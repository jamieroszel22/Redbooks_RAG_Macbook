m branches) = 12 K
- /SM590000 BTB2: Second Level Branch Target Buffer, also variable capacity (variable directory), up to 260 k branches

Branch prediction also implements auxiliary predictors for:

- /SM590000 Direction:
- -Two table TAGE 4  Pattern History Table (PHT): A two-level table (with different history lengths). Branch direction is predicted based on history.
- -Perceptron: Called a Perceptron because this is a neural network algorithm that learns to correlate branch history over time and predicts direction of branches that the other mechanisms cannot catch with sufficient accuracy
- /SM590000 Target:
- -Two table TAGE Changing Target Buffer (CTB): A two-level table (with different history lengths). Branches are remembered that have different targets depending on history.
- -Return Address Table Call/Return Stack (RAT CRS): Multi-level CRS that is implemented as a table lookup
