ient CCW/IDAW structure for certain categories of data-chaining I/O operations.

MIDAW can improve FICON performance for extended format data sets. Nonextended data sets also can benefit from MIDAW.

MIDAW can improve channel use and I/O response time. It also reduces FICON channel connect time, director ports, and control unit processor usage.

IBM laboratory tests indicate that applications that use EF data sets, such as Db2, or long chains of small blocks can gain significant performance benefits by using the MIDAW facility.

MIDAW is supported on FICON channels that are configured as CHPID type FC. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.
