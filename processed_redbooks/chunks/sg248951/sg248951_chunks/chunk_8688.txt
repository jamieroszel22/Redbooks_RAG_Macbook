8.8  System Recovery Boost Upgrade

Important: The base System Recovery Boost capability is built into IBM z16 firmware and does not require ordering more features. System Recovery Boost Upgrade (consisting of FC 9930 and FC 6802) is an optional, orderable feature that provides more temporary zIIP capacity for use during boost periods. Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 FC 9930 is not required to use the base System Recovery Boost capability.
- /SM590000 FC 9930 is only needed if more zIIP temporary capacity is required.
