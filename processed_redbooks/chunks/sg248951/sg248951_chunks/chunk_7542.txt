As of this writing, the FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+(CHPID type FC) support the FICON protocol and the zHPF protocol in the server LIC.

When used by the FICON channel, the z/OS operating system, and the DS8000 control unit or other subsystems, the FICON channel processor usage can be reduced and performance improved. Suitable levels of Licensed Internal Code (LIC) are required.

Also, the changes to the architectures provide end-to-end system enhancements to improve reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS).

zHPF is compatible with the following standards:

- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling standard (FC-FS)
- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Switch Fabric and Switch Control Requirements (FC-SW)
- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Single-Byte-4 (FC-SB-4) standards
