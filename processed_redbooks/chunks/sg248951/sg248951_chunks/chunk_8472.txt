Upgrade capability during On/Off CoD

Upgrades that involve physical hardware are supported while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active on a specific IBM z16 server. LICCC-only upgrades can be ordered and retrieved from IBM Resource Link, and can be applied while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active. LICCC-only memory upgrades can be retrieved and applied while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active.

Repair capability during On/Off CoD

If the IBM z16 requires service while an On/Off CoD upgrade is active, the repair can occur without affecting the temporary capacity.
