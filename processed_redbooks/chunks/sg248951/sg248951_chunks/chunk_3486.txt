must find the correct page for the correct address space.

Each TLB entry represents one page. As with other buffers or caches, lines are discarded from the TLB on a least recently used (LRU) basis.

The worst-case translation time occurs when a TLB miss occurs and the segment table (which is needed to find the page table) and the page table (which is needed to find the entry for the particular page in question) are not in cache. This case involves two complete real memory access delays plus the address translation delay. The duration of a processor cycle is much shorter than the duration of a memory cycle, so a TLB miss is relatively costly.

It is preferable to have addresses in the TLB. With 4 K pages, holding all of the addresses for 1 MB of storage takes 256 TLB lines. When 1 MB pages are used, it takes only one TLB line. Therefore, large page size users have a much smaller TLB footprint.
