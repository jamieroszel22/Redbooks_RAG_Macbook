The BHT (Branch History Table) implementation on processors provides a large performance improvement. Originally introduced on the IBM ES/9000 9021 in 1990, the BHT is continuously improved.

It offers significant branch performance benefits. The BHT allows each PU to take instruction branches that are based on a stored BHT, which improves processing times for calculation routines.

In addition to the BHT, IBM z16 servers use the following techniques to improve the prediction of the correct branch to be run:

- /SM590000 BTB
- /SM590000 PHT
- /SM590000 CTB

The success rate of branch prediction contributes significantly to the superscalar aspects of IBM z16 processor. This success is because the architecture rules prescribe that the correctly predicted result of the branch is essential for successful parallel execution of an instruction stream.

IBM z16 integrates a new branch prediction design that uses SRAM and supports the following enhancements over IBM z15:
