Multi-system environment

A two-site, two-system environment is only the base infrastructure. Flexible Capacity for Cyber Resiliency also is suited for complex multi-system environments.

Flexible Capacity from several systems can be transferred to single systems in Site B or vice-versa (see Figure D-9).

Movement of capacity does not need to be 'all to one': the capacity also can be split.

However, the total capacity that is active on all systems after the swap cannot exceed the total capacity that is active before the swap.

Flexibly Capacity is available on all engine types; exceeding the purchased capacity incurs charged. Monitoring to ensure compliance is done by way of Call Home data that IBM receives periodically.
