10 GbE RoCE Express3 SR and 10 GbE RoCE Express3 LR

The 10 GbE RoCE Express3 features (FC 0440 and FC 0441) are a RDMA/Ethernet technology refresh. The features support now also LR optics and 10 Gbit Ethernet switches with relaxed requirements. The features are installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer and are supported on IBM z16 servers only.

The 10 GbE RoCE Express3 are native PCIe features that do not use a CHPID and are defined by using the IOCP FUNCTION statement or in the HCD.

The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID).
