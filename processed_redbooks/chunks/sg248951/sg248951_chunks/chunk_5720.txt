t, is 100 meters (328 feet). A client-supplied cable is required. Two types of cables can be used for connecting the port to the selected 25 GbE switch or to another 25 GbE RoCE Express3 SR feature:

- /SM590000 OM3 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 2000 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 70 meters (229 feet)
- /SM590000 OM4 50-micron multimode fiber optic cable that is rated at 4700 MHz-km that ends with an LC Duplex connector, which supports 100 meters (328 feet)

The virtualization capabilities for IBM z16 are 63 Virtual Functions per port (126 VFs per feature/PCHID). One RoCE Express feature can be shared by up to 126 partitions (LPARs) (one adapter is one PCHID). The 25 GbE RoCE Express3 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector.

Note: Consider the following 25 GbE RoCE requirements:
