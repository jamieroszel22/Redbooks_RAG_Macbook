vector processing. These new instructions allow a larger number of operands to be processed with a single instruction. The SIMD instructions use the superscalar core to process operands in parallel.

SIMD provides the next phase of enhancements of IBM Z analytics capability. The set of SIMD instructions is a type of data parallel computing and vector processing that can decrease the amount of code and accelerate code that handles integer, string, character, and floating point data types. The SIMD instructions improve performance of complex mathematical models and allow integration of business transactions and analytic workloads on IBM Z servers.

The 32 vector registers feature 128 bits. The instructions include string operations, vector integer, and vector floating point operations. Each register contains multiple data elements of a fixed size. The following instructions code specifies which data format to use and the size of the elements:
