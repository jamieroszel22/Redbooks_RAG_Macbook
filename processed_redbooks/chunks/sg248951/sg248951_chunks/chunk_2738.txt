lled IBM Telum) integrates a new cache hierarchy design with only two levels of physical cache (L1 and L2). The cache hierarchy (L1, L2) is implemented with dense static random access memory (SRAM).

Unlike the IBM z15, eDRAM is no longer used in the IBM Telum processor. On an IBM z16, L2 cache (32 MB) is semi-private with 16 MB dedicated to the associated core, and 16 MB shared with the system (the 50/50 split is adjustable). Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) caches are now virtual caches and are allocated on L2.

Two processor chips (up to eight active cores per PU chip) are combined in a Dual Chip Module (DCM) and four DCMs are assembled in a CPC drawer (eight PU chips). An IBM z16 can have from one CPC drawer (Max39) up to four (Max200).
