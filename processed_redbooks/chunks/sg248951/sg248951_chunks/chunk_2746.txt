e PU chips. As in IBM z15, the IBM z16 cache level structure is focused on keeping more data closer to the PU. This design can improve system performance on many production workloads.

HiperDispatch

To help avoid latency in a high-frequency processor design, PR/SM and the dispatcher must be prevented from scheduling and dispatching a workload on any processor available, which keeps the workload in as small a portion of the system as possible. The cooperation between z/OS and PR/SM is bundled in a function that is called HiperDispatch . HiperDispatch uses the IBM z16 cache topology, which features reduced cross-cluster 'help' and better locality for multi-task address spaces.
