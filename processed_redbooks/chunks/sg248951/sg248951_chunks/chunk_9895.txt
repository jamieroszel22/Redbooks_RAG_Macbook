y two weeks.

Planned outages are outages that are planned well in advance and go beyond this approximate two-week timeframe. This chapter does not distinguish between scheduled and planned outages.

Preventing unscheduled, scheduled, and planned outages was addressed by the IBM Z system design for many years.

IBM z16 A01 has a fixed size HSA of 256 GB. This size helps eliminate planning requirements for HSA and provides the flexibility to update dynamically the configuration. You can perform the following tasks dynamically: 1

- /SM590000 Add:
- -Logical partition (LPAR)
- -Logical channel subsystem (LCSS)
- -Subchannel set
- -Logical PU to an LPAR
- -Cryptographic coprocessor
- -Memory
- -Physical processor
- /SM590000 Remove a cryptographic coprocessor
- /SM590000 Enable I/O connections
- /SM590000 Swap processor types

By addressing the elimination of planned outages, the following tasks also are possible:
