Partition Detail Report warnings

IBM zPCR implemented a warning indicating that on IBM z13 and later, the best performance is achieved when the partition's logical CP count does not exceed the number of RCPs in a single drawer.

Additionally, IBM zPCR version 9.6.4 implemented a new notice for partitions approaching, within 10%, the maximum drawer size. This critical notice indicates that one or more partitions partition are getting close to a drawer boundary. When that happens, capacity growth by adding LCPs is very limited.

The new notice appears as a 'Note' message in the Partition Detail Report. The 'Note' and the partition LCPs are shaded with the same violet color, as shown for partition IFL-01 in Figure 12-12 above and for partition GP-02 in Figure 12-14 on page 496.
