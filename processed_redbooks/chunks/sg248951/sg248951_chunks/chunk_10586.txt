Secure console-to-console communications

The IBM z16 HMC features an industry standard-based, password-driven cryptography system. The Domain Security Settings are used to provide authentication and high-quality encryption. We recommend that clients use unique Domain Security settings to provide maximum security. These settings provide greater security than anonymous cipher suites, even if the default settings are used.

To allow greater flexibility in password selection, the password limit was increased to 64 characters and special characters are allowed for IBM z16.
