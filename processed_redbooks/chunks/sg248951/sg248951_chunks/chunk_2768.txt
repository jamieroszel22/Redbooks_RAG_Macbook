The IBM z16 superscalar PU core can have up to 10 instructions or operations that are running per cycle. This technology results in shorter workload runtime.

Enhanced branch prediction

If the branch prediction logic of the microprocessor makes the wrong prediction, all instructions in the parallel pipelines are removed. The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible.
