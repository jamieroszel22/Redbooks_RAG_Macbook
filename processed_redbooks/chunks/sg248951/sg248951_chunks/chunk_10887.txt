12.9.4  IBM z16 Performance Best Practices

Understand and follow the IBM z16 best practices and use the following tips to get the most efficiency, best performance and best throughput of the IBM z16:

- /SM590000 Collect the CPU MF counters (z/OS SMF 113s) on all LPARs. (CPU MF runs on every IBM z16 supported Operating Systems OS), see:

http://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/TC000066

- -For z/OS, capture correlator SMF 98 subtype 1.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Provides supervisor information in five seconds intervals and helps perform performance problem analysis. Check the following White paper: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6437547
- /SM590000 z/VM CPU MF is collected in Monitor records. (there is no SMF). For more information, refer to: https://www.vm.ibm.com/perf/tips/cpumf.html
