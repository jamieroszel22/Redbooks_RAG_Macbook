 an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set. With MIDAW, the extra CCW for the EF data set suffix is eliminated.

MIDAWs benefit EF and non-EF data sets. For example, to read 12 4 K records from a non-EF data set on a 3390 track, Media Manager chains together 12 CCWs by using data chaining. To read 12 4 K records from an EF data set, 24 CCWs are chained (two CCWs per 4 K record). By using Media Manager track-level command operations and MIDAWs, an entire track can be transferred by using a single CCW.

Performance benefits

z/OS Media Manager includes I/O channel program support for implementing EF data sets, and automatically uses MIDAWs when appropriate. Most disk I/Os in the system are generated by using Media Manager.
