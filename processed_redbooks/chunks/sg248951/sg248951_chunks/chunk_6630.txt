User-defined extensions support

User-defined extension (UDX) allows a developer to add customized operations to IBM's CCA Support Program. UDXs to the CCA support customized operations that run within the Crypto Express features when defined as a coprocessor.

UDX is supported under a special contract through an IBM or approved third-party service offering. The Crypto Cards website directs your request to an IBM representative for your geographic location. A special contract is negotiated between IBM and you for the development of the UDX code by IBM according to your specifications and an agreed-upon level of the UDX.
