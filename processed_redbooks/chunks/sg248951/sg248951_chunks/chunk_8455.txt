8.6.3  Ordering

Concurrently installing temporary capacity by ordering On/Off CoD is possible in the following manner:

- /SM590000 CP features equal to the MSU capacity of installed CPs
- /SM590000 IFL features up to the number of installed IFLs
- /SM590000 ICF features up to the number of installed ICFs
- /SM590000 zIIP features up to the number of installed zIIPs
- /SM590000 SAPs: Up to eight

On/Off CoD includes the following limits that are associated with its use:
