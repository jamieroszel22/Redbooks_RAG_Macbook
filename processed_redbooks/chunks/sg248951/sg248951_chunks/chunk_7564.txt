its (LCUs) and devices, zDAC compares the discovered controller information with the current system configuration. It then determines delta changes to the configuration for a proposed configuration.

All added or changed logical control units and devices are added into the proposed configuration. They are assigned proposed control unit and device numbers, and channel paths that are based on the defined policy. zDAC uses channel path chosen algorithms to minimize single points of failure. The zDAC proposed configurations are created as work I/O definition files (IODFs) that can be converted to production IODFs and activated.

zDAC is designed to run discovery for all systems in a sysplex that support the function. Therefore, zDAC helps to simplify I/O configuration on IBM z16 systems that run z/OS, and reduces complexity and setup time.
