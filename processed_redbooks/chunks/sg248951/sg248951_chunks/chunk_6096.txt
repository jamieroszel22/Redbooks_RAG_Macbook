r protected keys. The CPACF works synchronously with the PU, which means that the owning processor is busy when its coprocessor is busy. This setup provides a fast device for cryptographic services.

CPACF supports pervasive encryption. Simple policy controls allow businesses to enable encryption to protect data in mission-critical databases without the need to stop the database or re-create database objects. Pervasive encryption includes z/OS Dataset Encryption, z/OS Coupling Facility Encryption, z/VM encrypted hypervisor paging, and z/TPF transparent database encryption, which use performance enhancements in the hardware.

The CPACF offers a set of symmetric cryptographic functions that enhances the encryption and decryption performance of clear key operations. These functions are for SSL, virtual private network (VPN), and data-storing applications that do not require FIPS 140-2 Level 4 security.
