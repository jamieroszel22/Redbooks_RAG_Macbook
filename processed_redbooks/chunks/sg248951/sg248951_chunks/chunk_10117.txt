 the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA). This task helps you determine the resources that are required to support the removal of a drawer with acceptable degradation to the operating system images.

The EDA process determines which resources (including memory, PUs, and I/O paths) are free to allow for the removal of a drawer. You can run this preparation on each drawer to determine which resource changes are necessary. Use the results as input in the planning stage to help identify critical resources.

With this planning information, you can examine the LPAR configuration and workload priorities to determine how resources might be reduced and still allow the drawer to be concurrently removed.

Include the following tasks in the planning process:
