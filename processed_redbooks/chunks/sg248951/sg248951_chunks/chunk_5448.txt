4.4.3  Fan-out considerations

Fan-out slots in the CPC drawer can be used to plug different fan-outs. On IBM z16 A01, the CPC drawers can hold up to 48 PCIe fan-out cards (four-CPC drawers configuration).

Adapter ID number assignment

PCIe fan-outs and ports are identified by an Adapter ID (AID) that is initially dependent on their physical locations, which is unlike channels that are installed in a PCIe+ I/O drawer. Those channels are identified by a physical channel ID (PCHID) number that is related to their physical location. This AID must be used to assign a CHPID to the fan-out in the IOCDS definition. The CHPID assignment is done by associating the CHPID to an AID port (see Table 4-2.
