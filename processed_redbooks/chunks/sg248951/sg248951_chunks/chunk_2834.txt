 of the integrated accelerator for AI on the Telum chip is shown in Figure 3-14.

The AI accelerator is driven by the new Neural Networks Processing Assist (NNPA) instruction.

NNPA is a new nonprivileged Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) memory-to-memory instruction that operates on tensor objects that are in user program's memory. AI functions and macros are abstracted by NNPA.

Figure 3-15 shows the AI accelerator and its components:

- /SM590000 Data movers surround the compute arrays that consist of the Processor Tiles (PT)
- /SM590000 Processing Elements (PE)
- /SM590000 Special Function Processors (SFP)

Intelligent data movers and prefetchers are connected to the chip by way of ring interface for high-speed, low-latency, read/write cache operations at 200+ GBps read/store bandwidth, and 600+ GBps bandwidth between engines.
