 dynamic I/O support of InfiniBand 9  and ICA coupling links. Support is available for the CIB and CS5 CHPID type in the z/VM dynamic commands, including the change channel path dynamic I/O command.

Specifying and changing the system name when entering and leaving configuration mode are also supported. z/VM does not use InfiniBand or ICA, and does not support the use of InfiniBand or ICA coupling links by guests. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-5 on page 256.

7.4.4  Storage connectivity-related features and functions

In this section, we describe the storage connectivity-related features and functions.

zHyperlink Express

IBM IBM z14 introduced IBM zHyperLink Express as a brand new IBM Z input/output (I/O) channel link technology since FICON. The zHyperLink Express 1.1 feature is available with new IBM z16 systems and is designed to help bring data close to processing power, increase the scalability of transaction processing, and lower I/O latency.
