The following security characteristics are in effect:

- /SM590000 RSF requests always are started from the HMC to IBM. An inbound connection is never started from the IBM Service Support System.

- /SM590000 All data that is transferred between the HMC and the IBM Service Support System is encrypted with high-grade SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
- /SM590000 When starting the SSL/TLS-encrypted connection, the HMC validates the trusted host with the digital signature that is issued for the IBM Service Support System.
- /SM590000 Data that is sent to the IBM Service Support System consists of hardware problems and configuration data.

For more information about the benefits of Broadband RSF and the SSL/TLS-secured protocol, and a sample configuration for the Broadband RSF connection, see Integrating the HMC Broadband Remote Support Facility into Your Enterprise , SC28-7026.
