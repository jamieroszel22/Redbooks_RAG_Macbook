or and troubleshoot the environment

The following LPAR modes are available for DPM:

- /SM590000 z/VM
- /SM590000 Linux on IBM Z (also used for KVM deployments)
- /SM590000 Secure Service Container

If DPM is enabled, the IBM z16 system cannot run z/OS, IBM z/VSE, and z/TPF LPARs.

The IBM z16 can be initialized in PR/SM mode or in DPM mode, but not both.

DPM provides a GUI for PR/SM (to manage resources). Tools, such as HCD are in DPM mode and are not necessary.

This IBM Redbooks publication does not cover scenarios that use DPM.

For more information about the use of DPM, see IBM Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) Guide , SB10-7182.

Important: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 The Enabling DPM function is run on the SE and is performed by your IBM system Service Representative at installation time.
- /SM590000 If DPM is enabled, the IBM z16 system cannot run z/OS, IBM z/VSE, and z/TPF LPARs.
