 IBM z Processor Capacity Reference (IBM zPCR) tool supports the following workload categories:

- /SM590000 Low
- /SM590000 Low-Average
- /SM590000 Average
- /SM590000 Average-high
- /SM590000 High

For more information about the no-charge IBM zPCR tool (which reflects the latest IBM LSPR measurements), see the Getting Started with IBM z Processor Capacity Reference.

As described in 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481, the underlying performance sensitive factor is how a workload interacts with the processor hardware.

12.7  CPU MF counter data and LSPR workload type

Beginning with the z10 processor, the hardware characteristics can be measured by using CPU MF (SMF 113) counters data. A production workload can be matched to an LSPR workload category through these hardware characteristics.

For more information about RNI, see 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481.
