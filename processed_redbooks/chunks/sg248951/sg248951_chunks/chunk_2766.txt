Program results

The Out-of-Order execution does not change any program results. Execution can occur out of (program) order, but all program dependencies are accepted, and the same results are seen as in-order (program) execution. The design was optimized by increasing the Global Completion Table (GCT) from 48x3 to 60x3, which increased the issue queue size from 2x30 to 2x36 and designed a new Mapper.

This implementation requires special circuitry to make execution and memory accesses display in order to the software. The logical diagram of an IBM z16 core is shown in Figure 3-11 on page 83.

Memory address generation and memory accesses can occur out of (program) order. This capability can provide a greater use of the IBM z16 superscalar core, and improve system performance.
