plugged. Plug detection ensures correct location, and custom latches ensure retention. Further improvements to the fabric bus include symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) cables that connect the drawers.

To improve field-replaceable unit (FRU) isolation, advanced continuity checking techniques are applied to the SMP cables (Concurrent Cable Repair), with the new SMP cable plugging and unplugging tool.

The thermal RAS design also was improved for the field-replaceable water manifold for PU cooling.

The IBM z16 includes the following characteristics:
