pression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor's L3 cache. As a result, it provided much higher bandwidth and removed the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature.

The IBM z16 further addresses the growth of data compression requirements with the integrated on-chip compression unit (implemented in processor Nest, one per PU chip) that significantly increases compression throughput and speed compared to previous zEDC deployments.

IBM z16 IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC

IBM z16 on-chip compression provides value for existing and new compression users by bringing the compression facility into the PU chip, which is tied in L3 1  cache.

The IBM z16 Integrated Accelerator for zEDC delivers industry-leading throughput and replaces the zEDC Express PCIe adapter that is available on the IBM z14 and earlier servers.
