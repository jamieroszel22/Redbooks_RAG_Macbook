- /SM590000 Up to 48 DIMM are used per drawer in two rows (40 TB system maximum):
- -Organized in 8-channel Reed-Solomon RAIM groups
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; 50% reduced RAIM overhead (compared to IBM z15)
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RAIM protection (similar to IBM z15)
- -Up to three chip marks and one channel mark
- -DDR4 DRAM with on chip power regulation: N+1 voltage regulators
- -Standard Open Memory Interface (OMI); up to six OMI per drawer:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; CRC/Retry for soft errors
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Degrade bus lanes from four lanes to two lanes on hard error
- -No waiting for all eight RAIM channels, use first seven to respond:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RAIM recovery is used to enhance performance without affecting RAS
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Processor uses data from the first seven channels to respond
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Refetch data by using all eight RAIM channels if an error occurs
- /SM590000 Flexible memory:
