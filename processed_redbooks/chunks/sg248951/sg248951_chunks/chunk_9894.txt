 must be done to the system in a timely fashion. A scheduled outage can be caused by a disruptive patch that must be installed, or other changes that must be made to the system.

This outage is caused by changes or updates that must be done to the system. A planned outage can be caused by a capacity upgrade or a driver upgrade. A planned outage usually is requested by the customer, and often requires planning. The IBM z16 design phase focuses on enhancing planning to simplify or eliminate planned outages.

The difference between scheduled outages and planned outages might not be obvious. The general consensus is that scheduled outages occur sometime soon. The timeframe is approximately two weeks.

Planned outages are outages that are planned well in advance and go beyond this approximate two-week timeframe. This chapter does not distinguish between scheduled and planned outages.
