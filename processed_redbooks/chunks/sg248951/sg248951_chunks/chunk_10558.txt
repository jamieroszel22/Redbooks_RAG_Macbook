With IBM z16, a new recovery signal was implemented (N-mode power) for STP recovery. A CTN with IBM z16 for the Primary Time Server and the Backup Time server can be enabled (configured) to recover from a PTS or CTS failure by using the N-mode power (imminent power failure on the CTS [IBM z16 hardware] that is configured with dual utility power).
