 workload can be matched to an LSPR workload category through these hardware characteristics.

For more information about RNI, see 12.5, 'LSPR workload categories based on L1MP and RNI' on page 481.

The AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload is intended to match most client workloads. When no other data is available, use the AVERAGE RNI LSPR workload for capacity analysis.

Low-Average and Average-High categories allow better granularity for workload characterization but these categories can apply on IBM zPCR only.

The CPU MF data can be used determine workload type. When available, this data allows the RNI for a production workload to be calculated.
