 The IBM z16 is no exception. It has a new processor chip design with each processor unit (PU) running at 5.2 GHz. IBM 16 provides 17% more processor capacity per CPC drawer compared to the IBM z15.

The new processor chip design has a new cache hierarchy, on-chip AI accelerator that is shared by the PU cores, transparent memory encryption, and increased uniprocessor capacity (single thread and SMT similar).

The on-chip AI scoring logic provides submicrosecond AI inferencing for deep learning and complex neural network models.

The redesigned cache structure features the following cache sizes:

- /SM590000 256 KB L1 per PU core
- /SM590000 32 MB semi-private L2 per PU core
- /SM590000 256 MB (logical) shared victim virtual L3 per chip
- /SM590000 2 GB (logical) shared victim virtual L4 per CPC drawer

The result is improved system performance and scalability with 1.5x more cache capacity per core over the IBM z15 and reduced average access latency through a flatter topology.
