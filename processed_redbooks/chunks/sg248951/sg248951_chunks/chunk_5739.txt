tions between applications for server-to-server (SMC-R) or LPAR-to-LPAR (SMC-D) connectivity.

Shared Memory Communications Version 1

The following versions of SMC are available:

- /SM590000 SMC-R

SMC-R provides application transparent use of the RoCE-Express feature. This feature reduces the network overhead and latency of data transfers, which effectively offers the benefits of optimized network performance across processors.

- /SM590000 SMC-D

SMC-D was used with the introduction of the Internal Shared Memory (ISM) virtual PCI function. ISM is a virtual PCI network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory, which provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z intra-CPC communications.
