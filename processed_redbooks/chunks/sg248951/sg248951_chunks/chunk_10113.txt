To use the EDA function, configure enough physical memory and engines so that the loss of a single drawer does not result in any degradation to critical workloads during the following occurrences:

- /SM590000 A degraded restart in the rare event of a drawer failure
- /SM590000 A drawer replacement for repair or a physical memory upgrade

The following configurations especially enable the use of the EDA function. These IBM z16 features need enough spare capacity so that they can cover the resources of a fenced or isolated drawer. This configuration imposes limits on the following number of the client-owned PUs that can be activated when one drawer within a model is fenced:

- /SM590000 A maximum of:
- -39 PUs are configured on the Max39
- -82 PUs are configured on the Max82
- -125 PUs are configured on the Max125
- -168 PUs are configured on the Max168
- -200 PUs are configured on the Max200
