dedicated to a CF LPAR, or shared by multiple CF LPARs that run on the same system. However, having an LPAR with dedicated and shared ICFs at the same time is not possible.

Coupling Thin Interrupts

With the introduction of Driver 15F (zEC12 and zBC12), the IBM z/Architecture provides a thin interrupt class called Coupling Thin Interrupts 5 . The capabilities that are provided by hardware, firmware, and software support the generation of coupling-related 'Thin Interrupts' when the following situations occur:

- /SM590000 On the coupling facility (CF) side:
- -A CF command or a CF signal (arrival of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal) is received by a shared-engine CF image.
- -The completion of a CF signal that was previously sent by the CF occurs (completion of a CF-to-CF duplexing signal).
- /SM590000 On the z/OS side:
- -CF signal is received by a shared-engine z/OS image (arrival of a List Notification signal).
- -An asynchronous CF operation completes.
