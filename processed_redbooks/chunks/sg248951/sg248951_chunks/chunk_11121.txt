The IBM z16 Integrated Accelerator for zEDC delivers industry-leading throughput and replaces the zEDC Express PCIe adapter that is available on the IBM z14 and earlier servers.

IBM z16 compression and decompression are implemented in the Nest Accelerator Unit (NXU, see Figure 3-15 on page 91) on each processor chip and replaces the existing zEDC Express adapter in the PCIe+ I/O drawer.

One NXU is available per processor chip, which is shared by all cores on the chip and features the following benefits:

- /SM590000 New concept of sharing and operating an accelerator function in the nest
- /SM590000 Supports DEFLATE-compliant compression and decompression and GZIP CRC/ZLIB Adler
- /SM590000 Low latency
- /SM590000 High bandwidth
- /SM590000 Problem state execution
- /SM590000 Hardware and firmware interlocks to ensure system responsiveness
- /SM590000 Designed instruction
- /SM590000 Run in millicode
