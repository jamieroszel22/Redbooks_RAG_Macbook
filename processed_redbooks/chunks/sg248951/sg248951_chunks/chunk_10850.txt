uns at 5.2 GHz clock speed, which is the same as the IBM z15 processor chip, but the performance is increased. For N-way processors model, it increases 1.11x on average at equal N-way configuration.

These numbers differ depending on the workload type and LPAR configuration.

12.1.2  IBM z16 SMT capacity

From z13 to IBM z16, customers can choose to run two threads on IFL and zIIP cores by using SMT mode. SMT increases throughput by 10 - 40% (average 25%), depending on workload.

For zIIPs and IFLs, the performance improvement per SMT enabled core for z16 (3931) versus z15 (8561) is approximately 11%, which is the same improvement for zIIPs and IFLs in a single thread.

12.1.3  IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC)

Starting with z13, IBM introduced the zEnterprise Data Compression (zEDC) Express PCIe feature, which increases efficiency for data storing and data transfers.
