ducing the MSS, the channel subsystem is extended to assign a value 0 - 3 for each subchannel set, which is the SSID. A subchannel can be identified by its SSID and subchannel number.

Device number

A device number is an arbitrary number 0x0000 - 0xFFFF, which is defined by a system programmer in an I/O configuration for naming an I/O device. The device number must be unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem. It is assigned to the corresponding subchannel by channel subsystem when an I/O configuration is activated. Therefore, a subchannel in a subchannel set of a channel subsystem includes a device number together with a subchannel number for designating an I/O operation.

The device number provides a means to identify a device that is independent of any limitations that are imposed by the system model, configuration, or channel-path protocols.
