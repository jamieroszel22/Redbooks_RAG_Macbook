ns at extended distances. This enhancement to zHPF removes a key inhibitor for customers that are adopting zHPF over extended distances, especially when the IBM HyperSwap capability of z/OS is used.

From the z/OS perspective, the FICON architecture is called command mode and the zHPF architecture is called transport mode . During link initialization, the channel node and the control unit node indicate whether they support zHPF.

Requirement: All FICON channel path identifiers (CHPIDs) that are defined to the same LCU must support zHPF. The inclusion of any non-compliant zHPF features in the path group causes the entire path group to support command mode only.
