chnology branch prediction.

Branch prediction is now implemented as a two level BTB, BTB1 ('small' and 'fast'), and BTB2 (large, dense-SRAM). Now, BTB1 and BTB2 feature dynamic (variable) capacity:

- /SM590000 BTB1: First Level Branch Target Buffer, smaller than IBM z15, dynamic director, variable capacity:
- -Minimum total branches in all parents (all large branches) = 8 K
- -Maximum total branches in all parents (all medium branches) = 12 K
- /SM590000 BTB2: Second Level Branch Target Buffer, also variable capacity (variable directory), up to 260 k branches

Branch prediction also implements auxiliary predictors for:
