structure is managed by the CPM through the Capacity Provisioning Domain (CPD), which is controlled by the Capacity Provisioning Policy (CPP). The CPD is shown in Figure 8-14.

<!-- missing-text -->

The CPD configuration defines the CPCs and z/OS systems that are controlled by an instance of the CPM. One or more CPCs, sysplexes, and z/OS systems can be defined into a domain. Although sysplexes and CPCs do not have to be contained in a domain, they must not belong to more than one domain.

Each domain has one active capacity provisioning policy.

CPM operates in the following modes, which allows four different levels of automation:

- /SM590000 Manual

Use this command-driven mode when no CPM policy is active.

- /SM590000 Analysis

In analysis mode, CPM processes capacity-provisioning policies and informs the operator when a provisioning or deprovisioning action is required according to policy criteria.
