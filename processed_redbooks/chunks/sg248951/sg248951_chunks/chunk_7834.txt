Pervasive encryption for Linux on IBM Z

Pervasive encryption for Linux on IBM Z combines the full power of Linux with IBM z16 capabilities by using the support of the following features:

- /SM590000 Kernel Crypto: IBM z16 CPACF
- /SM590000 LUKS dm-crypt Protected-Key CPACF
- /SM590000 Libica and openssl: IBM z16 CPACF and acceleration of RSA handshakes by using SIMD
- /SM590000 Secure Service Container: High security virtual appliance deployment infrastructure

Protection of data at-rest

By using the integration of industry-unique hardware accelerated CPACF encryption into the standard Linux components, users can achieve optimized encryption transparently to prevent raw key material from being visible to operating systems and applications.
