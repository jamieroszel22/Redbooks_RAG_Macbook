uake Kit, RF (FC 8014 and FC 8015) is available for the IBM z16. The kit provides hardware to enhance the ruggedness of the frame, the frame stiffener, and to tie down the frame to a concrete floor.

The frame tie-down kit can be used on a nonraised floor (FC 8015) where the frame is secured directly to a concrete floor, or on a raised floor (FC 8014) where the frame is secured to the concrete floor underneath the raised floor.

Raised floors 241.3 mm (9.5 inches) - 1270 mm (50 inches) are supported.

The kits help secure the frames and their contents from damage when they are exposed to shocks and vibrations, such as in a seismic event. The frame tie-downs are intended for securing a frame that weighs up to 1308 kg (2885 lbs).
