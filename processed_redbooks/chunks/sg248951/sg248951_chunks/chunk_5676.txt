ON director features limited capability to assign ISL routes that are based on workload. This limitation can result in unbalanced use of ISLs (some might be overloaded, while others are under-used).

The dynamic routing ISL routes are dynamically changed based on the Fibre Channel exchange ID, which is unique for each I/O operation. ISL is assigned at I/O request time; therefore, different I/Os from same incoming port to same destination port are assigned different ISLs.

With FIDR, IBM z16 servers feature the following advantages for performance and management in configurations with ISL and cascaded FICON directors:

- /SM590000 Support sharing of ISLs between FICON and FCP (PPRC or distributed)
- /SM590000 I/O traffic is better balanced between all available ISLs
- /SM590000 Improved use of FICON director and ISL
- /SM590000 Easier to manage with a predicable and repeatable I/O performance
