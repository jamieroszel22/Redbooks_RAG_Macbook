The IBM z16 processor includes pipeline enhancements that benefit Out-of-Order execution. The processor design features advanced micro-architectural innovations that provide the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Maximized instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for a better cycles per instruction (CPI) design.
- /SM590000 Maximized performance per watt.
- /SM590000 Enhanced instruction dispatch and grouping efficiency.
- /SM590000 Increased Out-of-Order) resources, such as Global Completion Table entries, physical GPR entries, and physical FPR entries.
- /SM590000 Improved completion rate.
- /SM590000 Reduced cache/TLB miss penalty.
- /SM590000 Improved execution of D-Cache store and reload and new Fixed-point divide.
- /SM590000 New Operand Store Compare (OSC) (load-hit-store conflict) avoidance scheme.
- /SM590000 Enhanced branch prediction structure and sequential instruction fetching.
