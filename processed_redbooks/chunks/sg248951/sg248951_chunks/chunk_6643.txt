he current LPAR maximum). Customers can map individual LPARs to unique crypto domains or continue to share crypto domains across LPARs.

The following requirements must be met to support 85 domains:

- /SM590000 Hardware: IBM z16 A01 and Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Crypto Express6S
- /SM590000 Operating systems:
- -z/OS:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; New ICSF support is required to administer a CEX8 coprocessor by using a TKE workstation because of the exploitation of quantum algorithms. Otherwise, workloads run on IBM z16 without requiring ICSF support.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Exploitation of new function is supplied in ICSF PTFs on z/OS V2.2 V2.4 (Web deliverable HCR77D1) or V2.5 (base, which is HCR77D2).
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; When using new Quantum Safe Algorithms and sharing a KDS in a sysplex, ensure all ICSF PTFs are installed on all systems.
