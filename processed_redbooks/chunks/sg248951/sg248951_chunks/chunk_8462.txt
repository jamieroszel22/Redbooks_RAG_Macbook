If necessary, more LPARs can be activated concurrently to use the newly added processor resources.

Consideration: On/Off CoD provides a concurrent hardware upgrade that results in more capacity being made available to a system configuration. Extra planning tasks are required for nondisruptive upgrades. For more information, see 'Guidelines to avoid disruptive upgrades' on page 377.

To participate in this offering, you must accept contractual terms for purchasing capacity through the Resource Link, establish a profile, and install an On/Off CoD enablement feature on the system. Later, you can concurrently install temporary capacity up to the limits in On/Off CoD and use it for up to 180 days.
