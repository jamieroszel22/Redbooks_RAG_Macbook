 switches are recommended for redundancy).

Each SE and each HMC has two Ethernet RJ45 ports. An example of these connections are made without an HMA is shown in Figure 10-18.

Note: The HMC must be connected to the SEs by using a customer-provided switch. Direct connection between the HMC and the SEs is not supported.

The connectivity for multiple CPC generations and mixing stand-alone HMCs and HMAs environments (IBM z16 N-2 only) is shown in Figure 10-19.

Various methods are available for setting up the network. Designing and planning the HMC and SE connectivity is the customers' responsibility, based on the environment's connectivity and security requirements.

10.3.3  Network planning for the HMC and SE

Plan the HMC and SE network connectivity carefully to allow for current and future use. Many of the IBM Z capabilities benefit from the various network connectivity options.
