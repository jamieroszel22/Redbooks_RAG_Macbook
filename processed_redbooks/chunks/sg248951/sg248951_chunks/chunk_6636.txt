ry workstation (TKE) controlled selection of WRAPENH3 as the default TDES key token wrapping method for easier management.

CCA 7.2 and CCA 6.5

The following CCA 7.2 and 6.5 improvements were made:

- /SM590000 AES DUKPT unique key per transaction for AES-based PIN and transaction protection
- /SM590000 ISO 4 enhanced support for adding AES protected PIN block support to all remaining services that process PIN blocks
- /SM590000 Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) supports three algorithms that are standardized by NIST and in X9.124: FF1, FF2, and FF2.1

- /SM590000 Elliptic Curve support for the Koblitz curve secp256k1, to all ECC services including native support for X.509 certificates
