have a maximum of 82 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max125 (three CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 125 client PUs
- /SM590000 Feature Max168 (four CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 168 client PUs

- /SM590000 Feature Max200 (four CPC Drawers) can have a maximum of 200 client PUs
- /SM590000 Model capacity identifiers 4 xx , 5 yy , 6 yy , or 7 nn

The xx is a range of 00 - 39 2 , yy is a range of 01 - 39, and nn is a range of 01 - 99, A0 - K0, where A0 represents the decimal number 100, which combines the character A with decimal 0 and where K0 represents the decimal number 200. It is obtained by continuing the hexadecimal counting to the following values:

- -F = 15
- -G = 16
- -H = 17
- -I = 18
- -J = 19
- -K = 20
- -Adding the decimal digit 0 to make 200

An IBM z16 A01 with 200 client usable processors is an IBM z16 7K0. The model capacity identifier describes how many CPs are characterized ( xx , yy , or nn ) and the capacity setting (4, 5, 6, or 7) of the CPs.
