- /SM590000 A redesigned card combines the BMC and OSC that are implemented with IBM z16 Model A01. The internal physical cards (BMC and OSC) are separate, but combined as a single FRU because of a packaging design.
- /SM590000 Two local redundant oscillator cards are available per CPC drawer, each with one PPS port and one ETS port (RJ45 Ethernet, for both PTP and NTP).
- /SM590000 Current design requires Pulse Per Second signal use for providing maximum time accuracy for both NTP and PTP.
- /SM590000 An augmented precision oscillator (20 Parts Per Million [PPM] versus 50 PPM on previous systems) is used.
- /SM590000 The following PPS plugging rules apply (see Figure 2-11 on page 28):
- -Single CPC drawer plugs left and right OSC PPS coaxial connectors.
- -Multi-drawer plug CPC0 left OSC PPS and CPC1 left OSC PPS coaxial connectors.
