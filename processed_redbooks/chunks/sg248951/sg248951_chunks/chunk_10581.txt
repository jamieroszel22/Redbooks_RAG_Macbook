10.3.2  Stand-alone HMC connectivity

The following HMC feature codes can be carried forward from previous orders:

- /SM590000 FC 0062
- /SM590000 FC 0063
- /SM590000 FC 0082
- /SM590000 FC 0083

With these HMC feature codes, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed to support IBM z16.

You can use the IBM z16 with previously ordered HMCs and no HMA. It is possible to order the HMA FC 0129 later as MES.

The HMC communicates with the SE is through a customer-supplied Ethernet switch (two switches are recommended for redundancy).

Each SE and each HMC has two Ethernet RJ45 ports. An example of these connections are made without an HMA is shown in Figure 10-18.
