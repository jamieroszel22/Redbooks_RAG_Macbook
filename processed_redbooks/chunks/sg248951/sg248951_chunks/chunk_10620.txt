Microcode terms

The microcode features the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 The driver contains engineering change (EC) streams.
- /SM590000 Each EC stream covers the code for a specific component of IBM z16. It includes a specific name and an ascending number.
- /SM590000 The EC stream name and a specific number are one MCL.
- /SM590000 MCLs from the same EC stream must be installed in sequence.
- /SM590000 MCLs can include installation dependencies on other MCLs.
- /SM590000 Combined MCLs from one or more EC streams are in one Bundle.
- /SM590000 An MCL contains one or more Microcode Fixes (MCFs).

How the driver, bundle, EC stream, MCL, and MCFs interact with each other, is shown in Figure 10-27.

MCL Activation

By design and with planning, MCLs can be activated concurrently. Consider the following points:
