 server, 1 MB large pages become pageable if Virtual Flash Memory 14  is available and enabled. They are available only for 64-bit virtual private storage, such as virtual memory that is above 2 GB.

It is easy to assume that increasing the TLB size is a feasible option to deal with TLB-miss situations. However, this process is not as simple as it seems. As the size of the TLB increases, so does the processor usage that is involved in managing the TLB's contents. Correct sizing of the TLB is subject to complex statistical modeling to find the optimal tradeoff between size and performance.

3.6.2  Main storage

Main storage consists of memory space that is addressable by programs and storage that is not directly addressable by programs. Nonaddressable storage includes the hardware system area (HSA).

Main storage provides the following functions:
