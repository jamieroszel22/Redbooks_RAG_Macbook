12.9.8  IBM zPCR Large Partition Support

IBM zPCR version 9.6.4 8  implemented an important change to the LPAR Configuration Capacity Planning function. For the IBM z16, 3931 (Max200/700) a change was made to match the way RCPs per drawer are assigned when the total number RCPs in the configuration is up to 191. This change compensates for the way the RCP count per drawer actually occurs.
