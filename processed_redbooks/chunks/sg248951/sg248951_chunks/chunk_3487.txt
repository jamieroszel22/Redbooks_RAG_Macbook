pages, holding all of the addresses for 1 MB of storage takes 256 TLB lines. When 1 MB pages are used, it takes only one TLB line. Therefore, large page size users have a much smaller TLB footprint.

Large pages allow the TLB to better represent a large working set and suffer fewer TLB misses by allowing a single TLB entry to cover more address translations.

Users of large pages are better represented in the TLB and are expected to see performance improvements in elapsed time and processor usage. These improvements are because DAT and memory operations are part of processor busy time, even though the processor waits for memory operations to complete without processing anything else in the meantime.

To overcome the processor usage that is associated with creating a 1 MB page, a process must run for some time. It also must maintain frequent memory access to keep the pertinent addresses in the TLB.
