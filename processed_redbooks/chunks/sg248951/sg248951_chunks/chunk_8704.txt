s this capability can be installed on the system. CBU features can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively. For each system enabled for CBU, the authorization to use CBU is available for 1 - 5 years.

The alternative configuration is activated temporarily , and provides more capacity than the system's original, permanent configuration. At activation time, determine the capacity that you require for that situation. You can decide to activate only a subset of the capacity that is specified in the CBU contract.

The base system configuration must have sufficient memory and channels to accommodate the potential requirements of the large CBU target system. Ensure that all required functions and resources are available on the backup systems. These functions include CF LEVELs for coupling facility partitions, memory, and cryptographic functions, and connectivity capabilities.
