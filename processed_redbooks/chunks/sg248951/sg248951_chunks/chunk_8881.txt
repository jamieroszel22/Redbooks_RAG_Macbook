Processor identification

The following instructions are used to obtain processor information:

- /SM590000 Store System Information (STSI) instruction
- The STSI instruction can be used to obtain information about the current execution environment and any processing level that is below the current environment. It can be used to obtain processor model and model capacity identifier information from the basic machine configuration form of the system information block (SYSIB). It supports concurrent upgrades and is the recommended way to request processor information.
- /SM590000 Store CPU ID (STIDP) instruction
- STIDP returns information that identifies the execution environment, system serial number, and machine type.

Note: To ensure unique identification of the configuration of the issuing CPU, use the STSI instruction specifying basic machine configuration (SYSIB 1.1.1).
