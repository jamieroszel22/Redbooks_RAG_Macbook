elative weight settings, and no capping at all. It is best to avoid this scenario and instead attempt to establish a defined capacity that is equal or close to the relative weight.

/SM590000 Memory

Memory (main storage) must be dedicated to an LPAR. The defined storage must be available during the LPAR activation; otherwise, the LPAR activation fails.

Reserved storage can be defined to an LPAR, which enables nondisruptive memory addition to and removal from an LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (z/OS and z/VM). For more information, see 3.7.5, 'LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration' on page 127.
