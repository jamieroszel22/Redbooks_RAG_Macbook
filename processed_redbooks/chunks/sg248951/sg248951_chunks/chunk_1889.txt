sable Memory might be available to support one or more concurrent LIC CC Customer Memory upgrades with no DIMM changes.

IBM z16 implements enhanced RAIM design that includes the following features:

- /SM590000 Eight Channel Reed-Solomon 3  RAIM (IBM z15 uses 5-channel RAIM)
- /SM590000 90 → 80 DRAMs accessed across memory channels (11% reduction, excluding unused spare)
- /SM590000 Staggered Memory Refresh → Leverage RAIM to hide memory refresh penalty
- /SM590000 z16 Memory Buffer Chip Interface:
- -OpenCapi Memory Buffer (OCMB); Fully (meso)synchronous OCMB
- -Lane sparing replaced with lane degrade
- -256 B fetch support, remove 128 B store support
- /SM590000 Up to 2 TB / MCU → 10TB / Drawer (with six MCUs populated)
- /SM590000 Host-side Memory Encryption

Encryption occurs post-RAIM encoding, decryption pre-RAIM decoding (support unique key per memory channel)
