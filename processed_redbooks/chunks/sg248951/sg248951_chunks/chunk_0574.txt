andards to support data storage and access requirements, along with the latest FC technology in storage and access devices. FICON Express features support the following protocols:

- /SM590000 FICON

This enhanced protocol (as compared to FC) provides for communication across channels, channel-to-channel (CTC) connectivity, and with FICON devices, such as disks, tapes, and printers. It is used in z/OS, z/VM, IBM z/VSEfi (Virtual Storage Extended), z/TPF (Transaction Processing Facility), and Linux on IBM Z environments.

- /SM590000 Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP)

This standard protocol is used for communicating with disk and tape devices through FC switches and directors. The FCP channel can connect to FCP SAN fabrics and access FCP/SCSI devices. FCP is used by z/VM, KVM, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z environments.
