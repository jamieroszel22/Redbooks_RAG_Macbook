se manually entering VLAN IDs at the switch is no longer necessary.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

Link aggregation support for z/VM

Link aggregation (IEEE 802.3ad) that is controlled by the z/VM Virtual Switch (VSWITCH) allows the dedication of an OSA-Express port to the z/VM operating system. The port must be participating in an aggregated group that is configured in Layer 2 mode.

Link aggregation (trunking) combines multiple physical OSA-Express ports into a single logical link. This configuration increases throughput, and provides nondisruptive failover if a port becomes unavailable. The target links for aggregation must be of the same type.

Link aggregation is applicable to CHPID type OSD (QDIO). The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
