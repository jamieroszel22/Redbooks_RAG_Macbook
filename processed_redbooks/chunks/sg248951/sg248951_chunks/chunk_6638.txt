- /SM590000 Australian Payment Network Acquirer function for key derivation and MAC chaining added for interoperability with Australian audited payment networks

CCA 7.1

The following CCA 7.1 improvements were made:

- /SM590000 Supported curves:
- -NIST Prime Curves: P192, P224, P256, P384, and P521
- -Brainpool Curves: 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, and 512
- /SM590000 Support in the CCA coprocessor for Edwards curves ED25519 (128-bit security strength) and ED448 (224-bit security strength)

Although ED25519 is faster, ED448 is more secure. Practically though, 128-bit security strength is very secure.

Edwards curves are used for digitally signing documents and verifying those signatures.

Edwards curves are less susceptible to side channel attacks when compared to Prime and Brainpool curves.
