flat panel display, PCIe adapter, and a writable USB media to install the TKE Licensed Internal Code (LIC) are included with the system unit. The TKE workstation requires an IBM 4770 crypto adapter.

A TKE workstation is part of a customized solution for the use of the Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility for z/OS (ICSF for z/OS) or Linux for IBM Z. This program provides a basic key management system for the cryptographic keys of an IBM z16 system that has Crypto Express features installed.

The TKE provides a secure, remote, and flexible method of providing Master Key Part Entry, and to remotely manage PCIe cryptographic coprocessors. The cryptographic functions on the TKE run by one PCIe cryptographic coprocessor. The TKE workstation communicates with the IBM Z system through a TCP/IP connection. The TKE workstation is available with Ethernet LAN connectivity only. Up to 10 TKE workstations can be ordered.
