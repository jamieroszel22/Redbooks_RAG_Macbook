Processor availability

Processor resource availability for reallocation or deactivation is affected by the type and quantity of the resources in use, such as the following examples:

- /SM590000 Total number of PUs that are enabled through LICCC
- /SM590000 PU definitions in the profiles that can be dedicated and dedicated reserved or shared
- /SM590000 Active LPARs with dedicated resources at the time of the drawer repair or replacement

To maximize the PU availability option, ensure that sufficient inactive physical resources are on the remaining drawers to complete a drawer removal.

Memory availability

Memory resource availability for reallocation or deactivation depends on the following factors:

- /SM590000 Physically installed memory
- /SM590000 Image profile memory allocations
- /SM590000 Amount of memory that is enabled through LICCC
- /SM590000 Flexible memory option
- /SM590000 Virtual Flash Memory if enabled and configured
