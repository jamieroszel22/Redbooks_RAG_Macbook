 section introduces some of the RAS features that are incorporated in the IBM z16 design.

9.2.1  Processor Unit chip

IBM z16 uses the Processor Unit (PU) chip with the following technical changes:

- /SM590000 A PU chip is implemented by using EUV process with 7 nm FinFET lithography, and has eight cores (PUs) per chip (design) that are running at 5.2 GHz.
- /SM590000 Each core has private L1 (instruction and data) caches and a semi-private L2 cache, which are 32 MB. The eight cores and L2 caches on the chip communicate through bidirectional high-speed on-chip ring and with all SMP, I/O, and memory interfaces (see Figure 9-2 on page 381).
