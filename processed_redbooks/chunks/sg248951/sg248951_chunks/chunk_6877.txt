e best option for you.

The TKE 10.0 LIC requires the 4770 crypto adapter. The TKE 9.x and TKE 8.x workstations can be upgraded to the TKE 10.0 tower workstation by purchasing a 4770 crypto adapter.

The Omnikey Cardman 3821 smart card readers can be carried forward to any TKE 10.0 workstation. Smart cards 45D3398, 74Y0551, and 00JA710 can be used on TKE 10.0.

When performing a MES upgrade from TKE 8.x, or TKE 9.x to a TKE 10.0 installation, the following steps must be completed:

- 1. Save Upgrade Data on an old TKE to USB memory to save client data.
- 2. Replace the 4767 crypto adapter with the 4768 crypto adapter.
- 3. Upgrade the firmware to TKE 10.0.
- 4. Install the Frame Roll to apply Save Upgrade Data (client data) to the TKE 10.0 system.
- 5. Run the TKE Workstation Setup wizard.

TKE upgrade considerations

The TKE LIC does not need to be upgraded if you are migrating your configuration with Crypto Express6S and TKE Release 9.x to an IBM z16.
