- a. General mode uses 64-bit z/Architecture
- b. IBM Secure Service Container
- c. IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA), Hyper Protect Virtual Servers (HPVS), and others

The 64-bit z/Architecture mode has no special operating mode because the architecture mode is not an attribute of the definable images operating mode. The 64-bit operating systems are in 31-bit mode at IPL and change to 64-bit mode during their initialization. The operating system is responsible for taking advantage of the addressing capabilities that are provided by the architectural mode.

For information about operating system support, see Chapter 7, 'Operating system support' on page 247.

Logically partitioned mode

If the IBM z16 A01 system runs in LPAR mode, each of the 85 LPARs can be defined to operate in one of the following image modes:
