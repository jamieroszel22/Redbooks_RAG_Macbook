es: Layer 2 (Link Layer) and the current Layer 3 (Network or IP Layer). Traffic can be Internet Protocol (IP) Version 4 or Version 6 (IPv4, IPv6) or non-IP (AppleTalk, DECnet, IPX, NetBIOS, or SNA).

HiperSockets devices are protocol-independent and Layer 3-independent. Each HiperSockets device features its own Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) address. This MAC address allows the use of applications that depend on the existence of Layer 2 addresses, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers and firewalls.

Layer 2 support can help facilitate server consolidation. Complexity can be reduced, network configuration is simplified and intuitive, and LAN administrators can configure and maintain the mainframe environment the same way as they do a nonmainframe environment.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
