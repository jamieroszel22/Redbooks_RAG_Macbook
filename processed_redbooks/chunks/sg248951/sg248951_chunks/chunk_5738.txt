GbE RoCE Express2 feature uses SR optics and supports the use of a multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector.

Note: Consider the following 10 GbE RoCE Express2 requirements:

- /SM590000 The 10 GbE RoCE Express2 feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only.
