ctivity by using shared memory access between multiple operating system images within the same CPC. ISM creates virtual adapters with shared memory that is allocated for each operating system image.

ISM is defined by the FUNCTION statement with a virtual CHPID (VCHID) in HCD/IOCDS. Identified by the PNETID parameter, each ISM VCHID defines an isolated, internal virtual network for SMC-D communication, without any hardware component required. Virtual adapters are defined by virtual function (VF) statements. Multiple LPARs can access the same virtual network for SMC-D data exchange by associating their VF with same VCHID.

Applications that use HiperSockets can realize network latency and CPU reduction benefits and performance improvement by using the SMC-D over ISM.

IBM z16 servers support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a total maximum of 8,000 VFs.
