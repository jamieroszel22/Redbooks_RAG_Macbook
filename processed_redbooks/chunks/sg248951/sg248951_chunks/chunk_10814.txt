Digitally signed firmware

Security and data integrity are critical issues with firmware upgrades. Procedures are in place to use a process to digitally sign the firmware update files that are sent to the HMC, SE, and TKE. By using a hash algorithm, a message digest is generated that is then encrypted with a private key to produce a digital signature.
