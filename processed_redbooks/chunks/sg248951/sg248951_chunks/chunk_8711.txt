ore the expiration date can cause the system to degrade gracefully back to its original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines or the last in-use shared engine.

CBU example

An example of a CBU operation is shown in Figure 8-15. The permanent configuration is a 504, and a record contains seven CP CBU features. During an activation, multiple target configurations are available. With 7 CP CBU features, you can add up to 7CPs within the same MCI, which allows the activation of a 506, 507, through to a 511(the blue path).

Alternatively, 4 CP CBU features can be used to change the MCI (in the example from a 504 to a 704) and then add the remaining 3 CP CBU features to upgrade to a 707 (the red path).
