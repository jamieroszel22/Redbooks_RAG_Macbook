8.5.1  Ordering

IBM Resource Link provides the interface that enables you to order a concurrent upgrade for a system. You can create, cancel, or view the order, and view the history of orders that were placed through this interface.

Configuration rules enforce that only valid configurations are generated within the limits of the individual system. Warning messages are issued if you select invalid upgrade options. The process allows only one permanent CIU-eligible order for each system to be placed at a time.
