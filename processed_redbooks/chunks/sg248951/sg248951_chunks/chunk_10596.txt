oogle Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password.

The secret key is generated by HMC/SE/TKE while the user is performing first factor log-on. The secret key is known only to HMC/SE/TKE and to the user's device. For that reason, it must be protected as much as your first factor password.

MFA code that was generated as a second factor is time-sensitive. Therefore, it is important to remember that it must be used as soon as possible after it is generated.

The algorithm within the HMC that is responsible for MFA code generation changes the code every 30 seconds. However, to ease the process, the HMC and SE console accepts current, previous, and next MFA codes.
