d functions and resources are available on the backup systems. These functions include CF LEVELs for coupling facility partitions, memory, and cryptographic functions, and connectivity capabilities.

When the emergency is over (or the CBU test is complete), the system must be returned to its original configuration. The CBU features can be deactivated at any time before the expiration date. Failure to deactivate the CBU feature before the expiration date can cause the system to downgrade resources gracefully to the original configuration. The system does not deactivate dedicated engines, or the last of in-use shared engines.
