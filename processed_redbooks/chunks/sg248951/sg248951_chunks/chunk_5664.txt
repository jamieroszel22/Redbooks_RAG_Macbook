IBM z16 servers support 32 K devices per FICON channel for all FICON features.

Each FICON Express channel can be defined independently for connectivity to servers, switches, directors, disks, tapes, and printers, by using the following CHPID types:

- /SM590000 CHPID type FC: The FICON, zHPF, and FCTC protocols are supported simultaneously.
- /SM590000 CHPID type FCP: Fibre Channel Protocol that supports attachment to SCSI devices directly or through Fibre Channel switches or directors.

FICON channels (CHPID type FC or FCP) can be shared among LPARs and defined as spanned. All ports on a FICON feature must be of the same type (LX or SX). The features are connected to a FICON capable control unit (point-to-point or switched point-to-point) through a Fibre Channel switch.
