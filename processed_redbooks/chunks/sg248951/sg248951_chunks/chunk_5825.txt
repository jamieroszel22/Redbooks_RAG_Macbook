The use of another subchannel set for these special devices helps reduce the number of devices in the subchannel set 0, which increases the growth capability for accessing more devices.

Initial program load from an alternative subchannel set

IBM z16 A01 systems support initial program load (IPL) from alternative subchannel sets in addition to subchannel set 0. Devices that are used early during IPL processing now can be accessed by using subchannel set 1, subchannel set 2, or subchannel set3 on an IBM z16.
