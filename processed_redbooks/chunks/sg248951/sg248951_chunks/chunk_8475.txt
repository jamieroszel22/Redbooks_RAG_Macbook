8.7  z/OS Capacity Provisioning

This section describes how z/OS Capacity Provisioning can help you manage the addition of capacity to a server to handle workload peaks.

z/OS Capacity Provisioning is delivered as part of the z/OS MVS Base Control Program (BCP).

Capacity Provisioning includes the following components:

- /SM590000 Capacity Provisioning Manager (Provisioning Manager)
- /SM590000 Capacity Provisioning Management Console (available in the IBM z/OS Management Facility)
- /SM590000 Sample data sets and files

The Provisioning Manager monitors the workload on a set of z/OS systems and organizes the provisioning of extra capacity to these systems when required. You define the systems to be observed in a domain configuration file.
