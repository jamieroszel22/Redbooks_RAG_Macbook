- /SM590000 CF Asynchronous Duplexing for Lock Structures:
- -New asynchronous duplexing protocol for lock structures:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; z/OS sends command to primary CF only
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Primary CF processes command and returns result
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Primary CF forwards description of required updates to secondary CF
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Secondary CF updates secondary structure instance asynchronously
- -Provided for lock structures only:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; z/OS V2R2 SPE with PTFs for APAR OA47796
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Db2 V12 with PTFs
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Most performance-sensitive structures for duplexing
- -Benefit and value:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Db2 locking receives performance similar to simplex operations
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Reduces CPU and CF link overhead
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Avoids the overhead of synchronous protocol handshakes on every update
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Duplexing failover much faster than log-based recovery
