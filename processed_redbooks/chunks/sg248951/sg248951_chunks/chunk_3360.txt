ity upgrade. Reserved processors are similar to spare logical processors and can be shared or dedicated. Reserved CPs can be defined to an LPAR dynamically to allow for nondisruptive image upgrades.

Reserved processors can be dynamically configured online by an operating system that supports this function if enough unassigned PUs are available to satisfy the request. The PR/SM rules that govern logical processor activation remain unchanged.

By using reserved processors, you can define more logical processors than the number of available CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs in the configuration to an LPAR. This process makes it possible to nondisruptively configure online more logical processors after more CPs, IFLs, ICFs, and zIIPs are made available concurrently. They can be made available with one of the capacity on-demand options.
