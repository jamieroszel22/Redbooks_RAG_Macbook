System Recovery Boost

With IBM z16, System Recovery Boost feature (first introduced with IBM z15) enables the restoration of service from, and catch up after, planned and unplanned outages faster than on any previous IBM Z with no extra software cost. It also provides faster site switching changeover between systems active in different sites (in a GDPS configured environment).
