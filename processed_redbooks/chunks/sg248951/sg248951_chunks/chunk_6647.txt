oped. In addition, the standards themselves were increasing the strength of their requirements over time. Some requirements that were optional in earlier versions of the standards are now mandatory.

In general, the trend is for the card brands to enforce more of the PCI standards and to enforce them more rigorously. The trend in the standards is to impose more and stricter requirements in each successive version. The net result is that companies subject to these requirements can expect that they eventually must comply with all of the requirements.

Improved security through use of PCI-HSM

PCI-HSM was developed primarily to improve security in payment card systems. It imposes requirements in key management, HSM API functions, and device physical security. It also controls during manufacturing and delivery, device administration, and several other areas. It prohibits many things that were in common use for many years, but are no longer considered secure.
