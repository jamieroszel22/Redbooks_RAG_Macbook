d issues I/O by using EADMF for asynchronous execution.

Asynchronous execution maintains the current user experience and provides a transparent implementation for existing authorized users of zEDC.

The On-Chip data compression implements compression as defined by RFC1951 (DEFLATE).

Figure 3-12 shows the nest compression accelerator (NXU) for On-Chip Compression acceleration.

Coprocessor units (on-core)

A data compression coprocessor and a cryptography coprocessor unit is available on each core in the IBM Telum chip.

The compression engine uses static dictionary compression and expansion that is based on CMPSC instruction. The compression dictionary uses the level 1 (L1) cache (instruction cache).
