cryptographic coprocessor that can be used 2  for cryptographic algorithms that uses clear keys or protected keys. For more information, see 6.4, 'CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions' on page 219.

The Crypto Express8S adapter is an HSM that is placed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer of IBM z16. It also supports cryptographic algorithms by using secret keys. For more information, see 6.5, 'Crypto Express8S' on page 224.

Finally, a TKE workstation is required for entering keys in a secure way into the Crypto Express8S HSM, which often also is equipped with smart card readers. For more information, see 6.6, 'Trusted Key Entry workstation' on page 239.

The feature codes and purpose of the cryptographic hardware features that are available for IBM z16 are listed in Table 6-1.
