7.5  z/OS migration considerations

Except for base processor support, z/OS releases do not require any of the functions that are introduced with the IBM z16. Minimal toleration support that is needed depends on z/OS release.

Although IBM z16 servers do not require any 'functional' software, it is recommended to install all IBM z16 service before upgrading to the new server. The support matrix for z/OS releases and the IBM Z servers that support them are listed in Table 7-16, where 'X' indicates that the hardware model is supported.

- a. Server is withdrawn from marketing.
- b. The IBM Software Support Services provides the ability for customers to purchase extended defect support service for z/OS.
