n Secure IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) coprocessor mode provides PKCS #11 secure key support for public sector requirements. Before EP11, the ICSF PKCS #11 implementation supported only clear keys.

In EP11, keys can now be generated and securely wrapped under the EP11 Master Key. The secure keys never leave the secure coprocessor boundary decrypted.

The secure IBM Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) coprocessor runs the following tasks:

- /SM590000 Encrypt and decrypt (AES, DES, TDES, and RSA)
- /SM590000 Sign and verify (DSA, RSA, and ECDSA)
- /SM590000 Generate keys and key pairs (DES, AES, DSA, ECC, and RSA)
- /SM590000 HMAC (SHA1, SHA2 or SHA3 [SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512])
- /SM590000 Digest (SHA1, SHS2 or SHA3 [SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512])
- /SM590000 Wrap and unwrap keys
- /SM590000 Random number generation
- /SM590000 Get mechanism list and information
- /SM590000 Attribute values
- /SM590000 Key Agreement (Diffie-Hellman)
