 point arithmetic complex and error-prone for programmers who use it for applications in which the data is typically decimal.

Hardware DFP computational instructions provide the following features:

- /SM590000 Data formats of 4, 8, and 16 bytes
- /SM590000 An encoded decimal (base 10) representation for data
- /SM590000 Instructions for running decimal floating point computations
- /SM590000 An instruction that runs data conversions to and from the decimal floating point representation
