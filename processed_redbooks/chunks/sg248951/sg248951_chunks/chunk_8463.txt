 establish a profile, and install an On/Off CoD enablement feature on the system. Later, you can concurrently install temporary capacity up to the limits in On/Off CoD and use it for up to 180 days.

Monitoring occurs through the system call-home facility. An invoice is generated if the capacity is enabled during the calendar month. You are billed for the use of temporary capacity until the system is returned to the original configuration. Remove the enablement code if the On/Off CoD support is no longer needed.

On/Off CoD orders can be pre-staged in Resource Link to allow multiple optional configurations. The pricing of the orders is done at the time that you order them, and the pricing can vary from quarter to quarter. Staged orders can have different pricing.
