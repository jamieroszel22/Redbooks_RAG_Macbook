sign worldwide port names (WWPNs) to the physical ports of an FCP channel that is based on the PCHID. This WWPN assignment changes when an FCP channel is moved to a different physical slot position.

IBM z14 and newer servers allow for the modification of these default assignments, which also allows FCP channels to keep previously assigned WWPNs, even after being moved to a different slot position. This capability can eliminate the need for reconfiguration of the SAN in many situations, and is especially helpful during a system upgrade (FC 0099 - WWPN Persistence).

FICON support for multiple-hop cascaded SAN configurations

Before the introduction of z13 and z13s servers, IBM Z FICON SAN configurations supported a single ISL (a single hop) in a cascaded FICON SAN environment only.

IBM z14 and newer servers support up to three hops in a cascaded FICON SAN environment. This support allows clients to more easily configure a three- or four-site disaster recovery solution.
