AS are associated with new features and functions to ensure that IBM Z servers deliver exceptional value to clients.

The following overriding RAS requirements are principles as shown in Figure 9-1:

- /SM590000 Include existing (or equivalent) RAS characteristics from previous generations.
- /SM590000 Learn from current field issues and addressing the deficiencies.
- /SM590000 Understand the trend in technology reliability (hard and soft) and ensure that the RAS design points are sufficiently robust.
- /SM590000 Invest in RAS design enhancements (hardware and firmware) that provide IBM Z and Customer valued differentiation.
