allow multiple optional configurations. The pricing of the orders is done at the time that you order them, and the pricing can vary from quarter to quarter. Staged orders can have different pricing.

When the order is downloaded and activated, the daily costs are based on the pricing at the time of the order. The staged orders do not have to be installed in the order sequence. If a staged order is installed out of sequence and later a higher-priced order is staged, the daily cost is based on the lower price.

Another possibility is to store multiple On/Off CoD LICCC records on the SE with the same or different capacities, which gives you greater flexibility to enable quickly needed temporary capacity. Each record is easily identified with descriptive names, and you can select from a list of records that can be activated.
