ling. For more information about supported coupling link technologies on IBM z16, see 4.6.4, 'Parallel Sysplex connectivity' on page 187, and the Coupling Facility Configuration Options white paper.

Note: IBM z16 does not support InfiniBand coupling links. More planning might be required to integrate the IBM z16 in a Parallel Sysplex with IBM IBM z14servers.

7.5.8  z/OS XL C/C++ considerations

IBM z/OS V2.R4 XL C/C++ is an optional feature of z/OS that continues to ship with IBM z16.

The following new functions provide performance improvements for applications by using new IBM z16 instructions:

- /SM590000 High-performance math libraries
- /SM590000 MASS
- /SM590000 Replace Atlas with OpenBLAS
- /SM590000 Metal C for modernizing HLASM applications and systems programming
