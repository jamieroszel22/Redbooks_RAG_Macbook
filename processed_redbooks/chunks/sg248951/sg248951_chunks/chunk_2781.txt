Crypto functions enhancements

The IBM z16 microprocessor structure was optimized and aligned to the new cache hierarchy. Co-processor results (data) are stored by way of level 1 (L1) cache.

The crypto/hashing/UTF-conversion/compression engines were redesigned for increased throughput.

CPACF accelerator that is built into every core supports Pervasive Encryption by providing fast synchronous cryptographic services:

- /SM590000 Encryption (DES, TDES, and AES)
- /SM590000 Hashing (SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, and SHAKE)
- /SM590000 Random Number Generation (PRNG, DRNG, and TRNG)
- /SM590000 Elliptic Curve supported operations:
- -ECDH[E]:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; P256, P384, and P521
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; X25519 and X448
- -ECDSA:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Keygen, sign, and verify
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; P256, P384, and P521
