op considering zIIP-eligible work for dispatch.

This option runs as much zIIP-eligible work on zIIPs as possible. It also allows it to spill over onto the CPs only when the zIIPs are overcommitted.

- /SM590000 Option 2: Java dispatching by priority (IIPHONORPRIORITY=NO)
- zIIP-eligible work runs on zIIPs only while at least one zIIP engine is online. zIIP-eligible work is not normally dispatched on a CP, even if the zIIPs are overcommitted and CPs are unused. The exception is that zIIP-eligible work can sometimes run on a CP to resolve resource conflicts.

Therefore, zIIP-eligible work does not affect the CP utilization that is used for reporting through the subcapacity reporting tool (SCRT), no matter how busy the zIIPs are.

If zIIPs are defined to the LPAR but are not online, the zIIP-eligible work units are processed by CPs in order of priority. The system ignores the IIPHONORPRIORITY parameter in this case and handles the work as though it had no eligibility to zIIPs.
