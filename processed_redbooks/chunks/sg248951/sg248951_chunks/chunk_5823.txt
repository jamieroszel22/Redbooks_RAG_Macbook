 by user. An I/O device can always be identified by an SSID with a subchannel number or a device number. For example, a device with device number AB00 of subchannel set 1 can be designated as 1AB00.

Normally, the subchannel number is used by the programs to communicate with the channel subsystem and I/O device, whereas the device number is used by a system programmer, operator, and administrator.

Device in subchannel set 0 and extra subchannel sets

An LCSS always includes the first subchannel set (SSID 0), which can have up to 63.75 K subchannels with 256 subchannels that are reserved by the channel subsystem. Users can always define their I/O devices in this subchannel set for general use.

For the extra subchannel sets enabled by the MSS facility, each has 65535 subchannels (64 K minus one) for specific types of devices. These extra subchannel sets are referred as alternative subchannel sets in z/OS.
