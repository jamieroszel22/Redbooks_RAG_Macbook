 Generation 4 (x16 @32 GBps), but the CPC I/O fan-out infrastructure provides external connectivity as PCIe Generation 3 @16GBps

A PCIe Gen3 x16 link features the following data transmission rates:

- /SM590000 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per lane:
- 8 Gbps * 128/130 bit (encoding) = 7.87 Gbps=984.6 MBps
- /SM590000 The maximum theoretical data transmission rate per link:

984.6 MBps * 16 (lanes) = 15.75 GBps

Considering that the PCIe link is full-duplex mode, the data throughput rate of a PCIe Gen3 x16 link is 31.5 GBps (15.75 GBps in both directions).

Link performance: The link speeds do not represent the performance of the link. The performance depends on many factors, including latency through the adapters, cable lengths, and the type of workload.

PCIe Gen3 x16 links are used in IBM z16 servers for driving the PCIe+ I/O drawers, and for coupling links for CPC to CPC communications.
