7.3.2  Coupling and clustering

The supported coupling and clustering functions for z/OS and z/VM are listed in Table 7-5.

Note: z/OS V2R2 support ended as of September 2020. No new function is provided for the use of the new hardware features (toleration support only). Although extended (fee-based) support for z/OS V2.R2 can be obtained, support for z/OS V2.R2 is not covered extensively in this document.
