R2 and later also support Dynamic Memory Downgrade (DMD), which allows the removal of up to 50% of the real storage from a running z/VM system.

SLES 11 and later supports concurrent add and remove.

3.7.4  Logical partition storage granularity

Granularity of main storage for an LPAR depends on the largest main storage amount that is defined for initial or reserved main storage, as listed in Table 3-8 16 .

<!-- missing-text -->

LPAR storage granularity information is required for LPAR image setup and for z/OS RSU definition. On IBM z16 A01, LPARs are limited to a maximum of 16 TB of main storage. However, the maximum amount of memory that is supported by z/OS V2R2, V2R3, and V2R4 is 4 TB. z/OS V2R5 supports up to 16 TB. For z/VM V7R1 the limit is 2 TB, and z/VM V7R2 increases the limit to 4 TB.
