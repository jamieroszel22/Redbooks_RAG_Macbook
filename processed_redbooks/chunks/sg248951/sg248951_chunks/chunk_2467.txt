ng features:

- /SM590000 CPC Drawers, PCIe+ I/O drawers, Radiators, and Support Elements
- /SM590000 The redundancy for each component is achieved by plugging the power cables into the paired PDUs.

For example, the top Support Element (1), has one power supply plugged into PDU A1 and the second power supply plugged into the paired PDU A2 for redundancy.

Note: Customer power sources should always maintain redundancy across PDU pairs; that is, one power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A1 and the separate power source or distribution panel supplies power for PDU A2.

As a best practice, connect the odd-numbered PDUs (A1, B1, C1, and D1) to one power source or distribution panel, and the even-numbered PDUs (A2, B2, C2, and D2) to a separate power source or distribution panel.

The frame count rules (number of frames) for IBM z16 A01 are listed in Table 2-14.
