ation. The on-chip accelerator enables load balancing of high compression loads and low latency and high bandwidth compared to zEDC Express, while maintaining current user experience on compression.

Function support for the IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEDC is listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.

For more information, see Appendix C, 'IBM Integrated Accelerator for zEnterprise Data Compression' on page 507.

7.4.3  Coupling and clustering features and functions

In this section, we describe the coupling and cluster features.

Coupling facility and CFCC considerations

Coupling facility (CF) connectivity to an IBM z16 is supported on the z16, IBM z14, or another IBM z16. The CFCC levels that are supported on IBM Z are listed in Table 7-15.
