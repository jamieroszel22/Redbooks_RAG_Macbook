3.3.2  CPC drawer interconnect topology

CPC drawers are interconnected in a point-to-point topology that allows a CPC drawer to communicate with every CPC drawer. Data transfer does not always have to go through another CPC drawer to address the requested data or control information.

The IBM z16 A01 inter-CPC drawer communication structure is shown in Figure 3-6.

A simplified topology of a four-CPC drawer system is shown in Figure 3-7.

Inter-CPC drawer communication occurs at the Level 4 virtual cache level, which is implemented on the semi-private part of one of the Level 2 caches in a chip module. The Level 4 cache function regulates coherent drawer-to-drawer traffic.
