Requirements of zHyperLink

The zHyperLink Express feature is available on IBM z16 servers, and includes the following requirements:

- /SM590000 z/OS 2.2 or later
- /SM590000 Supported DS8000 (see Getting Started with IBM zHyperLink for z/OS , REDP-5493)
- /SM590000 zHyperLink Express adapter (FC 0431) installed
- /SM590000 FICON channel as a driver
- /SM590000 Only ECKD supported
- /SM590000 z/VM is not supported

Up to 16 zHyperLink Express adapters can be installed in an IBM z16 (up to 32 links).

The zHyperLink Express is virtualized as a native PCIe adapter and can be shared by multiple LPARs. Each port can support up to 127 Virtual Functions (VFs), with one or more VFs/PFIDs being assigned to each LPAR. This configuration gives a maximum of 254 VFs per adapter.

The zHyperLink Express requires the following components:

- /SM590000 zHyperLink connector on supported DS8000 I/O Bay.
- /SM590000 Optic Fiber Cable
