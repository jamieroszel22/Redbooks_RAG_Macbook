cess to the same physical layer 2 network (that is, the same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet.

SMC Version 2 (SMCv2) provides support for SMC over multiple IP subnets for SMC-D and SMC-R and is referred to as SMC-Dv2 and SMC-Rv2. SMCv2 requires updates to the underlying network technology. SMC-Dv2 requires ISMv2 and SMC-Rv2 requires RoCEv2.

The SMCv2 protocol is downward compatible, which allows SMCv2 hosts to continue to communicate with SMCv1 down-level hosts.

Although SMCv2 changes the SMC connection protocol enabling multiple IP subnet support, SMCv2 does not change how user TCP socket data is transferred, which preserves the benefits of SMC to TCP workloads.

TCP/IP connections that require IPsec are not eligible for any form of SMC.
