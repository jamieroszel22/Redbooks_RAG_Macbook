8.2.3  Concurrent and nondisruptive upgrades

Depending on the effect on the system and application availability, upgrades can be classified in the following manner:

- /SM590000 Concurrent

In general, concurrency addresses the continuity of operations of the hardware during an upgrade; for example, whether a system (hardware) must be turned off during the upgrade. For more information, see 8.3, 'Concurrent upgrades' on page 334.

- /SM590000 Nonconcurrent

This type of upgrade requires turning off the hardware that is being upgraded. Examples include memory upgrades to an IBM z16 A01 max 39.

- /SM590000 Nondisruptive

Nondisruptive upgrades do not require the software or operating system to be restarted for the upgrade to take effect.

- /SM590000 Disruptive
