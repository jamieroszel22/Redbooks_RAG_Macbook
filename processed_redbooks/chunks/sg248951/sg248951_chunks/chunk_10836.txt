11.3  Physical specifications

This section describes the weights and dimensions of IBM z16 server.

The IBM z16 can be installed on a raised or nonraised floor. (For more information about weight distribution and floor loading tables, see IBM 3931 Installation Manual for Physical Planning , GC28-7015). This data is used with the maximum frame weight, frame width, and frame depth to calculate the floor loading.

Weight estimates for the maximum system configurations on the 3931 PDU-based system are listed in Figure 11-10 on page 469.

Notes: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Weight is based on the maximum system configuration.
- /SM590000 All weights are approximate and do not include Earthquake Kit hardware.
- /SM590000 Ensure that the raised floor on which you are installing the server can support the weight.
