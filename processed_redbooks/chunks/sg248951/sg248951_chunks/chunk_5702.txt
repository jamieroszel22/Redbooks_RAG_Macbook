 multimode fiber 25 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Ethernet switch that is capable of 25 Gbps. The port can be defined as a spanned channel and shared among LPARs within and across logical channel subsystems.

The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR1.1 feature supports the use of an industry standard small form factor (SFP+) LC Duplex connector. Ensure that the attaching or downstream device includes an SR transceiver. The sending and receiving transceivers must be the same (SR to SR).

The OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR1.1 feature does not support auto-negotiation to any other speed and runs in full duplex mode only.

A 50 µm multimode fiber optic cable that ends with an LC Duplex connector is required for connecting each port on this feature to the selected device.
