zHyperLink is a new technology that provides up to 5x reduction in I/O latency times for Db2 read requests with the qualities of service IBM Z clients expect from I/O infrastructure for Db2 v11 plus fixes (for read support) and v12 plus fixes (for write support) with z/OS.

The following z/OS versions are supported for zHyperLink:

- /SM590000 z/OS V2.5
