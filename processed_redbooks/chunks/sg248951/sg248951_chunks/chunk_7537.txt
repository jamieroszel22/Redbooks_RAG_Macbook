FICON Express16SA

FICON Express16SA (carry forward to IBM z16 server) supports a link data rate of 16 gigabits per second (Gbps) and auto negotiation to 8 Gbps for synergy with switches, directors, and storage devices. With support for native FICON, High-Performance FICON for IBM Z (zHPF), and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the IBM z16 server enables you to position your SAN for even higher performance, which helps you to prepare for an end-to-end 16 Gbps infrastructure to meet the lower latency and increased bandwidth demands of your applications.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.
