9.6  IBM z16 availability characteristics

The following functions include availability characteristics on IBM z16:

- /SM590000 Enhanced drawer availability (EDA)

EDA is a procedure under which a CPC drawer in a multi-drawer system can be removed and reinstalled during an upgrade or repair action with no effect on the workload.

- /SM590000 Concurrent memory upgrade or replacement

Memory can be upgraded concurrently by using Licensed Internal Code Configuration Control (LICCC) if physical memory is available on the drawers.

The EDA function can be useful if the physical memory cards must be changed in a multi-drawer configuration (requiring the drawer to be removed).
