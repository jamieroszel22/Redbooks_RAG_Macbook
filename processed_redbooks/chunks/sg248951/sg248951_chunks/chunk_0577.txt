Working with the FICON SAN Infrastructure, zHyperLink can improve application response time, which cuts I/O-sensitive workload response time in half without requiring application changes. 3

Note: The zHyperLink channels complement FICON channels, but they do not replace FICON channels. FICON remains the main data driver and is mandatory for zHyperLink usage.

1.2.5  Network connectivity

The IBM z16 is a fully virtualized platform that can support many system images at once. Therefore, network connectivity covers not only the connections between the platform and external networks with Open Systems Adapter-Express (OSA-Express) and RoCE Express features, it supports specialized internal connections for intra-system communication through IBM HiperSockets and Internal Shared Memory (ISM).
