Depending on the number of I/O features, the configurator determines the number of PCIe+ I/O drawers that is required.

To better use the MES for I/O capability, carefully plan the initial configuration to allow concurrent upgrades up to the target configuration.

If a PCIe+ I/O drawer is added to an IBM z16 and original features must be physically moved to another PCIe+ I/O drawer, original card moves are disruptive.

z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux on Z do not provide dynamic I/O configuration support. Although installing the new hardware is done concurrently, defining the new hardware to these operating systems requires an IPL.

Tip: IBM z16 A01 features a hardware system area (HSA) of 256 GB (same as IBM z15 T01). IBM z14 M0x servers have a 192 GB HSA. HSA is not part of the client-purchased memory.
