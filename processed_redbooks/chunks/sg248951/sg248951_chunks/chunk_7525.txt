ng. It serializes its execution by using the normal structure object latches that all mainline commands use. However, a few 'edge conditions' in ECR processing still require structure-wide latching.

CF structure sizing changes are expected when upgrading from a previous CFCC Level to CFCC Level 25. In fact, CFLEVEL 25 can have more noticeable CF structure size increases associated with it, especially for smaller structures, because of task-related memory increases that are associated with the increased number of CF tasks in CFLEVEL 25
