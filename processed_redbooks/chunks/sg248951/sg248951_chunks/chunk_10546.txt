10.1  Introduction

The HMC is a closed system (appliance), which means that no other applications can be installed on it.

The HMC runs a set of management applications. On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA) feature FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. Stand-alone outside the IBM z16 HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) no longer can be ordered.

The following HMC feature codes can be carried forward from previous orders:

- /SM590000 FC 0062
- /SM590000 FC 0063
- /SM590000 FC 0082
- /SM590000 FC 0083

On the carry forward HMC features, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 must be installed to support IBM z16. Also, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed on the SE/HMC hardware that is provided with the HMA feature FC 0100 on IBM z15.
