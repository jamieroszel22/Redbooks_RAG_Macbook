e new IBM Z Channel Subsystem Function performs periodic polling from the channel to the end points for the logical paths that are established and reduces the number of useless Repair Actions (RAs).

The RDP data history is used to validate Predictive Failure Algorithms and identify Fibre Channel Links with degrading signal strength before errors start to occur. The new Fibre Channel Extended Link Service (ELS) retrieves signal strength.

- /SM590000 FICON Dynamic Routing

FICON Dynamic Routing (FIDR) enables the use of storage area network (SAN) dynamic routing policies in the fabric. With the IBM z16, FICON channels are no longer restricted to the use of static routing policies for inter-switch links (ISLs) for cascaded FICON directors.
