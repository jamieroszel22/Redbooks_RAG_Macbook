 Remote Copy (XRC), also uses the zIIP. Most z/OS Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem (DFSMS) system data mover (SDM) processing that is associated with z/OS Global Mirror can run on the zIIP.
- /SM590000 The first IBM user of z/OS XML system services is Db2 V9. For Db2 V9 before the z/OS XML System Services enhancement, z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing was partially directed to zIIPs when used as part of a distributed Db2 request through DRDA. This enhancement benefits Db2 by making all z/OS XML System Services non-validating parsing eligible to zIIPs. This configuration is possible when processing is used as part of any workload that is running in enclave SRB mode.
- /SM590000 z/OS Communications Server also allows the HiperSockets Multiple Write operation for outbound large messages (originating from z/OS) to be run by a zIIP. Application workloads that are based on XML, HTTP, SOAP, and Java, and traditional file transfer can benefit.
