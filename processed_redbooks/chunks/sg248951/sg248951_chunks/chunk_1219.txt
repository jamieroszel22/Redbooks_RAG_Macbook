transparently, and continues to provide the clock signal to the CPC.

Manage System Time

HMC level 2.16.0 (Driver 51) is required to manage system time for IBM z16 Model A01.

Network Time Protocol

The SEs provide the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client function. When Server Time Protocol (STP) is used, the time of an STP-only Coordinated Timing Network (CTN) can be synchronized to the time that is provided by a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. This configuration allows time-of-day (TOD) synchronization in a heterogeneous platform environment and throughout the LPARs running on the CPC.

Precision Time Protocol

For IBM z16 Model A01, Precision Time Protocol (PTP, IEEE 1588) also can be used as an external time source for IBM Z Server Time Protocol (STP) for an IBM Z Coordinated Timing Network (CTN). The initial implementation for PTP connectivity is provided by using the IBM Z Support Element (SE).
