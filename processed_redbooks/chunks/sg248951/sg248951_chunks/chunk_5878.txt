6.2.3  Keys

When encrypting a message, the sender transforms the clear text into a secret text. Doing so requires the following main elements:

- /SM590000 The algorithm is the mathematical or logical formula that is applied to the key and the clear text to deliver a ciphered result, or to take a ciphered text and deliver the original clear text.
- /SM590000 The key ensures that the result of the encrypting data transformation by the algorithm is only the same when the same key is used. That decryption of a ciphered message results only in the original clear message when the correct key is used. Therefore, the receiver of a ciphered message must know which algorithm and key must be used to decrypt the message.
