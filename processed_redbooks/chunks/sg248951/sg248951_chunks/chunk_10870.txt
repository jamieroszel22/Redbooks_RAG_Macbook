ss spaces than necessary can raise a workload's RNI. This increase occurs because the working set of instructions and data from each address space increases the competition for the processor caches.

Tuning to reduce the number of simultaneously active address spaces to the optimum number that is needed to support a workload can reduce RNI and improve performance. In the LSPR, the number of address spaces for each processor type and n-way configuration is tuned to be consistent with what is needed to support the workload. Therefore, the LSPR workload capacity ratios reflect a presumed level of software configuration tuning. Retuning the software configuration of a production workload as it moves to a larger or faster processor might be needed to achieve the published LSPR ratios.
