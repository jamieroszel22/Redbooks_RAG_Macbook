2.5.4  Memory upgrades

Memory upgrades can be ordered and enabled by LIC, upgrading the DIMM cards, adding DIMM cards, or adding a CPC drawer.

For a model upgrade that results in the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum memory increment is added to the system. Each CPC drawer has a minimum physical memory size of 1024 GB.

Memory allowed upgrades for Max200 models

Once a model Max200 is shipped, then the memory upgrades via MES are limited dependent on what configuration exists in the installed CPC drawers.
