ed direct access storage device (DASD) provides a subset of host support for the MSS facility to allow the use of an alternative subchannel set for Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) secondary volumes.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258. For more information about channel subsystem, see Chapter 5, 'Central processor complex channel subsystem' on page 197.

Subchannel sets

IBM z16 A01 supports four subchannel sets (SS0, SS1, SS2, and SS3).

Subchannel sets SS1, SS2, and SS3 can be used for disk alias devices of primary and secondary devices, and as Metro Mirror secondary devices. This set helps facilitate storage growth and complements other functions, such as extended address volume (EAV) and Hyper Parallel Access Volumes (HyperPAV).

See Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258 for list of supported operating systems.
