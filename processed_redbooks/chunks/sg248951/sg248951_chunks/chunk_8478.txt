 determine whether enough capacity tokens remain for the specified resource to be activated for at least 24 hours. If insufficient tokens remain, no resource from the On/Off CoD record is activated.

If a capacity token is used during an activation that is driven by the CPM, the corresponding On/Off CoD record is deactivated prematurely by the system. This process occurs even if the CPM activates this record, or parts of it. However, you receive warning messages five days before a capacity token is fully used.

The five days are based on the assumption that the consumption is constant for the five days. You must put operational procedures in place to handle these situations. You can deactivate the record manually, allow it to occur automatically, or replenish the specified capacity token by using the Resource Link application.
