Logical partitioning is a function that is implemented by the PR/SM on IBM z16. IBM z16 can run in LPAR mode, or in DPM mode. DPM provides a GUI for PR/SM to manage I/O resources dynamically.

PR/SM is aware of the processor drawer structure on IBM z16 servers. However, LPARs do not feature this awareness. LPARs feature resources that are allocated to them from various physical resources. From a systems standpoint, LPARs have no control over these physical resources, but the PR/SM functions do have this control.

PR/SM manages and optimizes allocation and the dispatching of work on the physical topology. Most physical topology that was handled by the operating systems is the responsibility of PR/SM.

As described in 3.5.9, 'Processor unit assignment' on page 110, the initial PU assignment is done during POR by using rules to optimize cache usage. This step is the 'physical' step, where CPs, zIIPs, IFLs, ICFs, and SAPs are allocated on the processor drawers.
