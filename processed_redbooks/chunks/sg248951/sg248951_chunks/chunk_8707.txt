8.10.2  CBU activation and deactivation

The activation and deactivation of the CBU function is your responsibility and does not require the onsite presence of IBM SSRs. The CBU function is activated or deactivated concurrently from the HMC by using the API. On the SE, CBU is activated by using the Perform Model Conversion task or through the API. The API enables task automation.

CBU activation

CBU is activated from:

- /SM590000 The SE by using the HMC and SSO to the SE
- /SM590000 By using the Perform Model Conversion task
- /SM590000 Through automation by using the API on the SE or the HMC

During a real disaster, use the Activate CBU option to activate the 90-day period.
