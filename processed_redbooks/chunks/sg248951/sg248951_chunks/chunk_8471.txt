8.6.6  Termination

A customer is contractually obligated to end the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature when a transfer in asset ownership occurs. A customer also can choose to end the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature without transferring ownership.

Removing FC 9898 ends the right to use the On/Off CoD. This feature cannot be ordered if a temporary session is active. Similarly, the CIU enablement feature cannot be removed if a temporary session is active. When the CIU enablement feature is removed, the On/Off CoD right-to-use feature is simultaneously removed. Reactivating the right-to-use feature subjects the client to the terms and fees that apply then.
