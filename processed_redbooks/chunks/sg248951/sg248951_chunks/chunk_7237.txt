Remember: A virtual appliance that is deployed in a Secure Service Container runs in a dedicated LPAR. When activated, it reduces the maximum number of available LPARs by one.

Dynamic PU add

Planning an LPAR configuration includes defining reserved PUs that can be brought online when extra capacity is needed. Operating system support is required to use this capability without an IPL; that is, nondisruptively. This support is available in z/OS for some time.

The dynamic PU add function enhances this support by allowing you to dynamically define and change the number and type of reserved PUs in an LPAR profile, which removes any planning requirements. The new resources are immediately made available to the operating system and in the case of z/VM, to its guests.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254.
