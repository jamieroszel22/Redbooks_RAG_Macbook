SAP configuration

A standard SAP configuration provides a well-balanced system for most environments. However, some application environments feature high I/O rates, typically Transaction Processing Facility (TPF) environments. In this case, more SAPs can be ordered.

Assigning more SAPs can increase the capability of the channel subsystem to run I/O operations. In IBM z16 systems, the number of SAPs plus the number of optional SAPs cannot exceed firmware limit of 128 threads.
