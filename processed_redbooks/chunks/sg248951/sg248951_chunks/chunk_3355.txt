zIIP installation

One CP must be installed with or before any zIIP is installed. In IBM z16 A01, the zIIP-to-CP ratio is 2:1 9 , which means that up to 132 zIIPs on feature Max200 can be characterized.

Unassigned zIIPs

New on IBM z16, an ICF that is purchased but not activated is registered as an unassigned ICF (FC 1974). When the system is later upgraded with another ICF, the system recognizes that an ICF was purchased and is present.

The allowable number of zIIPs for each model is listed in Table 3-3.
