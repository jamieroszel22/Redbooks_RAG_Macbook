The Trusted Key Entry (TKE) Workstation with smart card reader feature is required to support the administration of the Crypto Express8S when configured as an Enterprise PKCS #11 coprocessor.

The TKE10.0 is needed to support the new Crypto Express8S card. An example of the Cryptographic Configuration window is shown in Figure 10-32.

The Usage Domain Zeroize feature is provided to clear the suitable partition crypto keys for a usage domain when you remove a crypto card from a partition. Crypto Express8/7/6S in EP11 mode is configured to the standby state after the Zeroize process.
