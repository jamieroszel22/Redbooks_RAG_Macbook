- /SM590000 I/O traffic is better balanced between all available ISLs
- /SM590000 Improved use of FICON director and ISL
- /SM590000 Easier to manage with a predicable and repeatable I/O performance

FICON dynamic routing can be enabled by defining dynamic routing-capable switches and control units in HCD. Also, z/OS implemented a health check function for FICON dynamic routing.

Improved zHPF I/O execution at distance

By introducing the concept of pre-deposit writes, zHPF reduces the number of round trips of standard FCP I/Os to a single round trip. Originally, this benefit is limited to writes that are less than 64 KB.

zHPF on IBM z14 and newer servers were enhanced to allow all large write operations (&gt; 64 KB) at distances up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) to be run in a single round trip to the control unit. This improvement avoids elongating the I/O service time for these write operations at extended distances.
