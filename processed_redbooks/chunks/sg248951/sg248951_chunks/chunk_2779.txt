M Telum chip.

The compression engine uses static dictionary compression and expansion that is based on CMPSC instruction. The compression dictionary uses the level 1 (L1) cache (instruction cache).

The cryptography coprocessor is used for CPACF, which offers a set of symmetric cryptographic functions for encrypting and decrypting of clear key operations.

The compression and cryptography coprocessors feature the following characteristics:

- /SM590000 Each core has an independent compression and cryptographic engine.
- /SM590000 The coprocessor was redesigned to support SMT operation and for throughput increase.
- /SM590000 It is available to any processor type (regardless of the processor characterization).
- /SM590000 The owning processor is busy when its coprocessor is busy.

The location of the coprocessor on the IBM z16 chip is shown in Figure 3-13.
