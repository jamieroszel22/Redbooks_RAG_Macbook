y return to the CTS role.

With IBM z16, the IBF was discontinued. As such, Coupling Facility Nonvolatility requires Room-level, Row-level, or System-Level UPS for protecting against power failures.

New STP PTS/BTS methods enable better coverage across both BPA and iPDU configurations for a much broader scope of clients that can take advantage of STP high-reliability functions. The new strategy allows clients with UPS to more effectively monitor and manage their power efficiency across their data center.

STP resiliency for PTS/CTS transition IBM Z from IBF Sensing to N-Mode Power Sensing.

To enable the N-Mode Power Sensing, a one-time setup step is required. In the HMC Manage System Time task, a customer enables the automatic switch over function from CPC1 to CPC2 for STP. After the function is enabled, the power subsystem (BPA and iPDU) detects any power source loss (at the power cord or power side level).
