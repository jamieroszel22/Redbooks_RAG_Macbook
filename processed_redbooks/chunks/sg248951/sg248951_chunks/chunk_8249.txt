- /SM590000 Change specialty engines (recharacterization)

Considerations: Most of the MESs can be concurrently applied without disrupting the workload. For more information, see 8.3, 'Concurrent upgrades' on page 334. However, specific MES changes might be disruptive, such as adding PCIe IO drawers.

Memory upgrades that require dual inline memory module (DIMM) changes can be made nondisruptively if multiple CPC drawers are available and the

flexible memory option is used.
