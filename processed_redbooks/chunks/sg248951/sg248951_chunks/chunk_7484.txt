Virtual Flash Memory

IBM Virtual Flash Memory (FC 0644) offers up to 6.0 TB of memory for IBM z16 A01. VFM is provided for improved application availability and to handle paging workload spikes.

IBM Virtual Flash Memory is designed to help improve availability and handling of paging workload spikes when running z/OS. With this support, z/OS is designed to help improve system availability and responsiveness by using VFM across transitional workload events, such as market openings, and diagnostic data collection. z/OS also helps improve processor performance by supporting middleware use of pageable large (1 MB) pages.

VFM can help organizations meet their most demanding service level agreements and compete more effectively. VFM is easily configurable, and provides rapid time to value.
