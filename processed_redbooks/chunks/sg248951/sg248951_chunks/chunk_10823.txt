 costs. It also offers some standardization and ease of data center installation planning, which allows the IBM z16 to easily coexist with other platforms within the data center.

Power requirements

the IBM z16 is designed with a fully redundant power system. To make full use of the redundancy that is built into the server, the PDUs within one pair must be powered from different power distribution panels. In that case, if one PDU in a pair fails, the second PDU ensures continued operation of the server without interruption.

The second, third, and fourth PDU pairs are installed dependent on other CPC or PCIe+ I/O drawers installed. The locations of the PDU pairs and frames are listed in Table 11-1.

Power cords for the PDUs are attached to the options that are listed in Table 11-2.

A rear view of a maximum configured PDU-powered system with four CPC drawers and 12 PCIe+ I/O drawers is shown in Figure 11-1 on page 456.
