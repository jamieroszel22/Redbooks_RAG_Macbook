he same form factor and port granularity.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA-Express6S 10-Gigabit Ethernet LR and SR (carry forward)

OSA-Express6S 10-Gigabit Ethernet features are installed in the PCIe I/O drawer, which is supported by the 16 GBps PCIe Gen3 host bus. The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express5S features. They also retain the same form factor and port granularity. OSA-Express6S features were introduced with IBM IBM z14, can be carried forward to an IBM z15 (T01 and T02), and ordered with a new IBM z16 A01

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
