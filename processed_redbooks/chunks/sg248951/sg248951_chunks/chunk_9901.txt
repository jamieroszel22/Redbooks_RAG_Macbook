0 Single processor core checkstop and sparing.

This indicator shows that a processor core malfunctioned and is spared . IBM determines what to do based on the system and the history of that system.

- /SM590000 Point-to-point fabric for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) RAS design
- -The A-bus is the logical bus and it is split over 2 SMP9 cables:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; 11 bits per A-Bus
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; One SMP9 cable has six bits and the other has five bits.
- -CRC detection and replay
- -RAS lane Degrade and Call Home Strategy design
- -Concurrent repair of the SMP9 cable.

Having fewer components that can fail is an advantage. In a multi-drawer system, all of the drawers are connected by point-to-point connections. A drawer can always be added concurrently.

- /SM590000 Air-cooled system: radiator with redundant ( N +1) pumps.

IBM z16 implements true N +1 redundancy on pumps and blowers for the radiator.
