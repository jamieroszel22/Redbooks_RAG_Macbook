orts removal of a CPC drawer with minimal effect on the workload, consider the flexible memory option. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA.

Removal of a CPC drawer also removes the CPC drawer connectivity to the PCIe I/O drawers, and coupling links. The effect of the removal of the CPC drawer on the system is limited by the use of redundant I/O interconnect. (For more information, see 2.7.1, 'Redundant I/O interconnect' on page 52.) However, all ICA SR1.1 links that are installed in the removed CPC drawer must be configured offline.

If the enhanced drawer availability and flexible memory options are not used when a CPC drawer must be replaced, the memory in the failing drawer also is removed. This process might be necessary during an upgrade or a repair action.
