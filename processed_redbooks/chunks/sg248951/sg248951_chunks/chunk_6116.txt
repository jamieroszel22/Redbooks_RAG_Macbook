Attention: Switching between configuration modes erases all adapter secrets. The exception is when you are switching from Secure CCA to accelerator, and vice versa.

The Crypto Express8S feature is released for enhanced cryptographic performance. Customers who migrated to variable-length AES key tokens cannot take advantage of faster encryption speeds by using CPACF. Support is being added to translate a secure variable-length AES CIPHER token to a protected key token (protected by the system wrapping key). This support allows for faster AES encryption speeds when variable-length tokens are used while maintaining strong levels of security.
