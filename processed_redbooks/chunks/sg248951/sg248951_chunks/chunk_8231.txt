- /SM590000 Subcapacity licensing

Subcapacity licensing includes software charges for specific IBM products that are based on the use capacity of the logical partitions (LPARs) on which the product runs.

Subcapacity licensing removes the dependency between the software charges and CPC (hardware) installed capacity.

The subcapacity licensed products are charged monthly based on the highest observed 4-hour rolling average use of the logical partitions in which the product runs.
