In this section, we describe the features and functions of Base CPC.

HiperDispatch

The HIPERDISPATCH=YES/NO parameter in the IEAOPTxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB and on the SET OPT=xx command controls whether HiperDispatch is enabled or disabled for a z/OS image. It can be changed dynamically, without an IPL or any outage.

In z/OS, the IEAOPTxx keyword HIPERDISPATCH defaults to YES when it is running on an IBM z16, IBM z15, or IBM IBM z14system.
