l fact table and is surrounded by more dimension tables that hold information about each perspective of the data. For example, a star schema query joins various dimensions of a star schema data set.

- /SM590000 Db2 utilities that are used for index maintenance, such as LOAD, REORG, and REBUILD.
- Indexes allow quick access to table rows. However, the databases become less efficient over time and must be maintained as data in large databases is manipulated.

The zIIP runs portions of eligible database workloads, which helps to free computer capacity and lower software costs. Not all Db2 workloads are eligible for zIIP processing. Db2 UDB for z/OS V8 and later gives z/OS the information to direct portions of the work to the zIIP. The result is that in every user situation, different variables determine how much work is redirected to the zIIP.

On an IBM z16, the following workloads also can benefit from zIIPs:
