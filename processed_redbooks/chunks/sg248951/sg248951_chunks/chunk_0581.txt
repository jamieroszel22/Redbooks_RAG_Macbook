 RDMA (SMC-R).

With SMC-R, you can transfer huge amounts of data quickly and at low latency. SMC-R is transparent to the application and requires no code changes, which enables rapid time to value.

The RoCE Express3 features also can provide LAN connectivity for Linux on IBM Z, and comply with IEEE standards. In addition, RoCE Express features assume several functions of the TCP/IP stack that normally are performed by the PU, which allows significant performance benefits by offloading processing from the operating system.

Internal Shared Memory

ISM is a virtual Peripheral Component Express (PCI) network adapter that enables direct access to shared virtual memory. It provides a highly optimized network interconnect for IBM Z platform intra-communications.
