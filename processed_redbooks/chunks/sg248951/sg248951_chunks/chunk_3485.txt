Large page support

By default, page frames are allocated with a 4 KB size. IBM z16 servers also support large page sizes of 1 MB or 2 GB. The first z/OS release that supports 1 MB pages is z/OS V1R9. Linux on IBM Z 1 MB pages support is available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.2 and later.

The TLB reduces the amount of time that is required to translate a virtual address to a real address. This translation is done by dynamic address translation (DAT) when it must find the correct page for the correct address space.

Each TLB entry represents one page. As with other buffers or caches, lines are discarded from the TLB on a least recently used (LRU) basis.
