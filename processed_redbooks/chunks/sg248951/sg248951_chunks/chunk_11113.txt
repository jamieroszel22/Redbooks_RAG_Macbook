 nonprivileged Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) memory-to-memory instruction that operates on tensor objects that are in user programs' memory. AI functions and macros are abstracted by NNPA.

Figure B-2 shows the AI accelerator and its components: the data movers that surround the compute arrays are composed of the Processor Tiles (PT), Processing Elements (PE), and Special Function Processors (SFP).

Intelligent data movers and prefetchers are connected to the chip by way of a ring interface for high-speed, low-latency, read/write cache operations (200+ GBps read/store bandwidth, and 600+GBps bandwidth between engines).

Compute Arrays consist of 128 processor tiles with 8-way FP-16 FMA SIMD, which are optimized for matrix multiplication and convolution, and 32 processor tiles with 8-way FP-16/FP-32 SIMD, which is optimized for activation functions and complex functions.
