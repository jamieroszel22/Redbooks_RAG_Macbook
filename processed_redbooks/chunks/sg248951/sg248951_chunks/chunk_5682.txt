IBM z14 and newer servers support up to three hops in a cascaded FICON SAN environment. This support allows clients to more easily configure a three- or four-site disaster recovery solution.

For more information about the FICON multi-hop, see the FICON Multihop: Requirements and Configurations white paper at the IBM Techdocs Library website.
