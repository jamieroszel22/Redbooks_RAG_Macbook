 z/OS. The z/OS supported versions are the same ad for zHyperLink Express 1.1.

The zHyperLink Express feature (FC 0431) provides a low latency direct connection between IBM z16 and DS8000 I/O Port.

The zHyperLink Express is the result of new business requirements that demand fast and consistent application response times. It dramatically reduces latency by interconnecting the IBM z16 directly to I/O Bay of the DS8880 by using PCIe Gen3 x 8 physical link (up to 150 meters [492 feet]). A new transport protocol is defined for reading and writing IBM CKD data records 10 , as documented in the zHyperLink interface specification.

On IBM z16, the zHyperLink Express card is a carry forward PCIe adapter that installed in the PCIe+ I/O drawer. HCD definition support was added for new PCIe function type with PORT attributes.

Requirements of zHyperLink

The zHyperLink Express feature is available on IBM z16 servers, and includes the following requirements:
