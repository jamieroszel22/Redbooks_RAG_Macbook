ning for the HMC and SE

Plan the HMC and SE network connectivity carefully to allow for current and future use. Many of the IBM Z capabilities benefit from the various network connectivity options.

The following functions are examples that depend on the HMC connectivity:

- /SM590000 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) support, which can be used for HMC user authentication
- /SM590000 Network Time Protocol (NTP)
- /SM590000 RSF through broadband
- /SM590000 HMC remote access and HMC Mobile
- /SM590000 RSA SecurID support
- /SM590000 MFA with Time-based One Time Password (TOTP)

HMC File Transfer support

FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols are supported on the HMC and SE. All three file transfer protocols require login ID and password credentials.
