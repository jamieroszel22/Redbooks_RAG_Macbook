000BASE-T Ethernet feature supports only 1000 Mbps duplex mode (no auto-negotiation to 100 or 10 Mbps)

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA-Express7S 25 Gigabit Ethernet SR (carry forward to IBM z16)

OSA-Express7S 25 GbE SR1.1 (FC 0449) and OSA-Express7S 25 GbE (FC 0429) are installed in the PCIe I/O drawer and have one 25 GbE physical port and requires 25 GbE optics and Ethernet switch 25 GbE support (negotiation down to 10 GbE is not supported).

Consider the following points regarding operating system support:

- /SM590000 z/OS V2R1, V2R2, and V2R3 require fixes for the following APARs: OA55256 (VTAM) and PI95703 (TCP/IP).
- /SM590000 z/VM V6R4 and V7R1 require PTF for APAR PI99085.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.
