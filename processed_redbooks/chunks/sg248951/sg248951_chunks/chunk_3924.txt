upling facility images, but supported the other options OFF and ON for continued 'legacy' use.

Note: In IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN option is the only available behavior for shared-engine CF dispatching.

Specifying OFF or ON in CF commands and the CF configuration file are preserved for compatibility; however, a warning message is issued to indicate that these options are no longer supported and that DYNDISP=THIN behavior is to be used.

CFCC Level 24

CFCC level 24 is delivered on the IBM z15 (M/T 8561 and 8562) with driver level 41. CFCC level 24 adds the following features:

- /SM590000 CFCC Fair Latch Manager

This feature is an enhancement to the internals of the Coupling Facility (CFCC) dispatcher to provide CF work management efficiency and processor scalability improvements, and improve the 'fairness' of arbitration for internal CF resource latches across tasks.
