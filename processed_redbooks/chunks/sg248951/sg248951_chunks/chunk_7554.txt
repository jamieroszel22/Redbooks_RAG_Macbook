W cannot cross a page boundary. Therefore, the largest possible count is 4 K. The maximum data count of all the MIDAWs in a list cannot exceed 64 K, which is the maximum count of the associated CCW.

The scatter-read or scatter-write effect of the MIDAWs makes it possible to efficiently send small control blocks that are embedded in a disk record to separate buffers from those that are used for larger data areas within the record. MIDAW operations are on a single I/O block, in the manner of data chaining. Do not confuse this operation with CCW command chaining.

Extended format data sets

z/OS extended format (EF) data sets use internal structures (often not visible to the application program) that require a scatter-read (or scatter-write) operation. Therefore, CCW data chaining is required, which produces less than optimal I/O performance. Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here.
