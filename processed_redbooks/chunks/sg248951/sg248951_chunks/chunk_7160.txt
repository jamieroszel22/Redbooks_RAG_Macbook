IBM is working with Linux distribution Business Partners to provide further use of selected IBM z16 functions in future Linux on IBM Z distribution releases.

Consider the following guidelines:

- /SM590000 Use SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, Red Hat RHEL 9, or Ubuntu 22.10 LTS or newer in any new projects for IBM z16 servers.
- /SM590000 Update any Linux distribution to the latest service level before migrating to IBM z16 servers.
- /SM590000 Adjust the capacity of any Linux on IBM Z and z/VM guests, in terms of the number of IFLs and CPs, real or virtual, according to the PU capacity of the IBM z16 servers.

7.2.7  KVM hypervisor

KVM is offered through our Linux distribution partners to help simplify delivery and installation. Linux and KVM are provided from a single source. With KVM being included in the Linux distribution, ordering and installing KVM is easier.

For more information about KVM support, see the IBM Z website.
