 CPC on the left has two environments that are defined (production and test), and each has one z/OS and one coupling facility image. The coupling facility images share an ICF.

The LPAR processing weights are used to define how much processor capacity each CF image can include. The capped option also can be set for a test CF image to protect the production environment.

Connections between these z/OS and CF images can use internal coupling links to avoid the use of real (external) coupling links, and get the best link bandwidth available.

Dynamic CF dispatching

The dynamic coupling facility dispatching (DYNDISP) function features a dispatching algorithm that you can use to define a backup CF in an LPAR on the system. When this LPAR is in backup mode, it uses few processor resources.
