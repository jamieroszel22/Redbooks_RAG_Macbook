edures in place to handle these situations. You can deactivate the record manually, allow it to occur automatically, or replenish the specified capacity token by using the Resource Link application.

The Capacity Provisioning Management Console (CPMC) is a console that administrators use to work with provisioning policies and domain configurations and to monitor the status of a Provisioning Manager. The management console is implemented by the Capacity Provisioning task in the IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF). z/OSMF provides a framework for managing various aspects of a z/OS system through a web browser interface.

Capacity Provisioning Domain

The provisioning infrastructure is managed by the CPM through the Capacity Provisioning Domain (CPD), which is controlled by the Capacity Provisioning Policy (CPP). The CPD is shown in Figure 8-14.
