triped across the clusters of that drawer to take advantage of the lower latency memory access in a drawer. Also, PR/SM tries to consolidate storage onto drawers with the most processor entitlement.

With HiperDispatch enabled, PR/SM seeks to assign logical processors of a partition to the smallest number of PU chips within a drawer in cooperation with operating system to optimize shared cache usage.

PR/SM automatically keeps a partition's memory and logical processors on the same CPC drawer where possible. This arrangement looks simple for a partition, but it is a complex optimization for multiple logical partitions because some must be split among processors drawers.

All IBM z16 processor types can be dynamically reassigned except IFPs.

To use HiperDispatch effectively, WLM goal adjustment might be required. Review the WLM policies and goals and update them as necessary.
