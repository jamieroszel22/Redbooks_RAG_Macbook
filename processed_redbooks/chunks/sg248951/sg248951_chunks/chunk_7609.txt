des:

- /SM590000 QDIO, with CHPID types OSD
- /SM590000 Non-QDIO, with CHPID type OSE
- /SM590000 Local 3270 emulation, including OSA-ICC, with CHPID type OSC

Notes: Consider the following points:

- /SM590000 Operating system support is required to recognize and use the second port on the OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature.
- /SM590000 OSA-Express7S 1000BASE-T Ethernet feature supports only 1000 Mbps duplex mode (no auto-negotiation to 100 or 10 Mbps)

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-8 on page 259 and Table 7-9 on page 261.

OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet (carry forward)

IBM z14 introduced an Ethernet technology refresh with OSA-Express6S 1000BASE-T Ethernet features to be installed in the PCIe I/O drawer, which is supported by the 16 GBps PCIe Gen3 host bus. The performance characteristics are comparable to the OSA-Express5S features and they also retain the same form factor and port granularity.
