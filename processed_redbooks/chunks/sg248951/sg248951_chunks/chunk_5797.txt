4.7.3  Crypto Express7S feature (FC 0898 and FC 0899) as carry forward only

The Crypto Express7S are supported on IBM z16. These coprocessors are HSMs that provide high-security cryptographic processing as required by banking and other industries. This feature provides a secure programming and hardware environment wherein crypto processes are performed.

Each cryptographic coprocessor includes general-purpose processors, nonvolatile storage, and specialized cryptographic electronics, which are all contained within a tamper-sensing and tamper-responsive enclosure that eliminates all keys and sensitive data on any attempt to tamper with the device. The security features of the HSM are designed to meet the requirements of FIPS 140-2, Level 4, which is the highest security level defined.
