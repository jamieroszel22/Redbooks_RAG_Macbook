On-Chip Compression provides an up to 5% improvement in compression ratios for BSAM/VSAM data sets over zEDC while maintaining full compatibility.

Eliminating adapter sharing by using Nest Compression Accelerator

Sharing of zEDC cards is limited to 15 LPAR guests per adapter. The Nest Compression Accelerator removes this virtualization constraint because it is shared by all PUs on the processor chip and therefore is available to all LPARs and guests.

Moving the compression function from the (PCIe) I/O drawer to the processor chip means that compression can operate directly in L3 cache and data does not need to be passed by using I/O operations.

Compression modes

Compression is run in one of the following modes:

- /SM590000 Synchronous
