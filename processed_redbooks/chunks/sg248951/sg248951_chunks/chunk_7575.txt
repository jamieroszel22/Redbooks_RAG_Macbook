Increased performance for the FCP protocol

The FCP LIC is modified to help increase I/O operations per second for small and large block sizes, and to support 32-Gbps link speeds.

For more information about FCP channel performance, see the performance technical papers that are available at the IBM Z I/O connectivity page of the IBM IT infrastructure website.

The FCP protocol is supported by z/VM, z/VSE, and Linux on IBM Z. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257 and Table 7-7 on page 258.
