TKE upgrade considerations

The TKE LIC does not need to be upgraded if you are migrating your configuration with Crypto Express6S and TKE Release 9.x to an IBM z16.

Note: If your IBM z16 includes Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S, you can use TKE V9.2, which requires the 4768 cryptographic adapter.

For more information about TKE hardware support, see Table 6-3. For some functions, requirements must be considered; for example, the characterization of a Crypto Express adapter in EP 11 mode always requires the use of a TKE.
