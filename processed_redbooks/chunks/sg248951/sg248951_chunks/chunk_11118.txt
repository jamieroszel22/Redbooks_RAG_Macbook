amount of data that is captured, transferred, and stored continues to grow. Software-based compression algorithms can be costly in terms of processor resources, storage costs, and network bandwidth.

An optional PCIe feature that was available for IBM z14 servers, zEDC Express, addressed customer requirements by providing hardware-based acceleration for data compression and decompression. zEDC provided data compression with lower CPU consumption than compression technology that was available on the IBM Z server.

Customers deployed zEDC compression to deliver the following types of compression:

- /SM590000 Storage
- /SM590000 Data transfer
- /SM590000 Database
- /SM590000 In-application

Data compression delivers the following benefits:

- /SM590000 Disk space savings
- /SM590000 Improved elapse times
- /SM590000 Reduced CPU consumption
- /SM590000 Reduced network bandwidth requirements and transfer times
