unplanned outage because of a firmware problem
- /SM590000 A planned outage for a disruptive firmware upgrade
- /SM590000 A planned outage to add physical memory to a single CPC drawer configuration

The IBM Z hardware has decades of intense engineering behind it, which results in a robust and reliable platform. The hardware has many RAS features that are built into it.

For more information, see Chapter 9, 'Reliability, availability, and serviceability' on page 379.

2.6.1  RAS in the CPC memory subsystem

The IBM z16 A01 server includes the following RAS features:

- /SM590000 Up to 48 DIMM per drawer in two rows (40 TB system maximum):
- -Organized in eight-card RAIM groups:
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; 50% reduced RAIM overhead (compared to IBM z15)
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; RAIM protection (similar to IBM z15)
