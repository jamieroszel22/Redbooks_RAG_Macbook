ingle CPC drawer can be concurrently removed and reinstalled for an upgrade or repair. Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer.

Before removing the CPC drawer, the contents of the PUs and memory of the drawer must be relocated. PUs must be available on the remaining CPC drawers to replace the deactivated drawer. Also, sufficient redundant memory must be available if no degradation of applications is allowed.

To ensure that the CPC configuration supports removal of a CPC drawer with minimal effect on the workload, consider the flexible memory option. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA.
