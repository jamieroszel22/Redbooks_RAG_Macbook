It offers customers more Central Processor (CP) capacity during system recovery operations to accelerate the startup (IPL), shutdown or stand-alone dump operations (at image level - LPAR15). System Recovery Boost requires operating system support. No other IBM software charges are made during the boost period. System Recovery Boost can be used during LPAR shutdown or start to make the running operating",

The encryption key is unique per memory channel. Since the RAIM design uses eight channels to control the eight DIMMs in a group, the data on every DIMM in a group is encrypted with another key. The keys are generated once per IML, stored in the MCU, and locked against alteration, so the key values are Error Correction Code (ECC) protected. Since the encryption and decryption occur between RAIM error correction and memory, an encryption and decryption error is confined to a single memory channel. Encryption and decryption contain parity information to detect errors. Unauthorized physical access to the DIMMs will only deliver data which is distributed across eight DIMMs and encrypted with eight different keys. 2.5.4 Memory configurations Memory",

Central processor complex hardware components 51 Memory upgrades can be ordered and enabled by LIC, upgrading the DIMM cards, adding DIMM cards, or adding a CPC drawer. For an upgrade that results in the addition of a CPC drawer, the minimum memory increment is added to the system. Each CPC drawer has a minimum physical memory size of 1024 GB. During an upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation. Adding physical memory to the added drawer is also concurrent. If all or part of the added memory is enabled for use, it might become available to an active LPAR if the partition includes defined reserved storage. (For more information, see 3.7.3, \u201cReserved storage\u201d on page 128.) Alternatively, the added memory can be used by a defined LPAR that is activated after the memory is added. 3146 512 4448",

The CBU rights are registered in one or more records in the CPC. Up to eight records can be active, which can contain various CBU activation variations that apply to the installation. The number of CBU test activations that you can run for no extra fee in each CBU record is now determined by the number of years that are purchased with the CBU record. For example, a three-year CBU record includes three test activations, as compared to a one-year CBU record that has one test activation. You can increase the number of tests up to a maximum of 15 for each CBU record. The real activation of CBU lasts up to 90 days with a grace period of two days to prevent sudden deactivation when the 90-day period expires. The contract duration can be set 1 - 5 years.

For example, if two CBU CPs are added to the current model D03, and the capacity level does not change, the D03 becomes D05, as shown in the following example: (D03 + 2 = D05) If the capacity level changes to a E06, the number of extra CPs (three) is added to the three CPs of the D03, which results in a total number of CBU CP capacity features of six: (3 + 3 = 6) \u0002 The CBU cannot decrease the number of CPs. \u0002 The CBU cannot lower the capacity setting.

When the addition of temporary capacity that is requested by On/Off CoD for CPs results in a cross-over from one capacity identifier range to another, the total number of CPs active when the temporary CPs are activated is equal to the number of temporary CPs ordered. For example, when a configuration with model capacity identifier D03 specifies four temporary CPs through On/Off CoD, the result is a configuration with model capacity identifier E05. A cross-over does not necessarily mean that the CP count for the extra temporary capacity increases. The same D03 can temporarily be upgraded to a configuration with model capacity identifier F03.

Note: For initial installation, all power sources are required to run the system checkout diagnostics successfully. Note: Customer power sources should always maintain redundancy across PDU pairs; that is, one power source or distribution panel supplies power for iPDU A1 and the separate power source or distribution panel supplies power for iPDU A2. As a best practice, connect the odd-numbered iPDUs (A1, B1) to one power source or distribution panel, and the even-numbered iPDUs (A2, B2) to a separate power source or distribution panel.

Considerations Cache sizes are limited by ever-shrinking cycle times because they must respond quickly without creating bottlenecks. Access to large caches costs more cycles. Instruction and data cache (L1) sizes must be limited because larger distances must be traveled to reach long cache lines. This L1 access time generally occurs in one cycle, which prevents increased latency. Also, the distance to remote caches as seen from the microprocessor becomes a significant factor. For example, on an IBM z15, access to L4 physical cache (on the SC chip and which might not even be in the same CPC drawer) requires several cycles to travel the distance to the cache. On an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, having an L4 virtual, physically allocated on the shared L2 requires fewer processor cycles in many instances. Although large caches mean increased access latency, the new technology 7",

To overcome the inherent delays of the SMP CPC drawer design and save cycles to access the remote virtual L4 content, the system keeps instructions and data as close to the processors as possible. This configuration can be managed by directing as much work of a specific LPAR workload to the processors in the same CPC drawer as the L4 virtual cache. This configuration is achieved by having the IBM Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM) scheduler and the z/OS WLM and dispatcher work together.

It requires fewer system resources than the current software-only profiling, and provides information about hardware and program characteristics. RI also enhances JRE in making the correct decision by providing real-time feedback. 3.5 Processor unit functions The PU functions are described in this section. 3.5.1 Overview All PUs on an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ are physically identical. When the system is initialized, two integrated firmware processors (IFP) are allocated from the pool of PUs that is available for the entire system. The other PUs can be characterized to specific functions (CP, IFL, ICF, zIIP, or SAP). The function that is assigned to a PU is set by the Licensed",

These rules are intended to isolate processors that are used by different operating systems as much as possible on different CPC drawers and even on different PU chips. This configuration ensures that different operating systems do not use the same shared caches. For example, CPs and zIIPs are all used by z/OS, and can benefit by using the same shared caches. However, IFLs are used by z/VM and Linux, and ICFs are used by CFCC.

LPAR group capacity limit (LPAR group absolute capping) The group capacity limit feature allows the definition of a group of LPARs on a z16 system, and limits the combined capacity usage by those LPARs.

With this support, PR/SM and the HMC are enhanced to support a new option to limit the amount of physical processor capacity that is used by an individual LPAR when a PU is defined as a general-purpose processor (CP), zIIP, or an IFL processor that is shared across a set of LPARs. Unlike traditional LPAR capping, absolute capping is designed to provide a physical capacity limit that is enforced as an absolute (versus relative) value that is not affected by changes to the virtual or physical configuration of the system. Absolute capping provides an optional maximum capacity setting for logical partitions that is specified in the absolute processors capacity (for example, 5.00 CPs or 2.75 IFLs). This setting is specified independently by processor type (namely CPs, zIIPs, and IFLs) and provides an enforceable upper limit on the amount of the specified processor type that can be used in a partition.

Although dedicated engines are preferable to obtain the best CF performance, Coupling Thin Interrupts helps facilitate the use of a shared pool of engines, which helps to lower hardware acquisition costs. The interrupt causes a shared logical processor CF partition to be dispatched by PR/SM (if it is not already dispatched), which allows the request or signal to be processed in a more timely manner. The CF relinquishes control when work is exhausted or when PR/SM takes the physical processor away from the logical processor.

An IBM SSC partition is a specialized container for installing and running specific appliances. An appliance is an integration of operating system, middleware, and software components that work autonomously and provide core services and infrastructures that focus on usability and security. IBM SSC hosts most sensitive client workloads and applications. It acts as a highly protected and secured digital vault, enforcing security by encrypting the entire stack: memory, network, and data (both in-flight and at-rest). Applications that are running inside IBM SSC are isolated and protected from outsider and insider threats. IBM SSC combines hardware, software, and middleware and is unique to IBM Z platform. Though it is called a container, it should not be confused with purely software open source containers (such as Kubernetes or Docker). Note: Use cases for Flash did not change (for example,",

N_Port ID Virtualization N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) allows multiple system images (in LPARs or z/VM guests) to use a single FCP channel as though each were the sole user of the channel. First introduced with IBM z9\u00ae EC, this feature can be used with earlier FICON features that were carried forward from earlier servers.

It is beyond the scope of this book to describe all possible migration scenarios. Always consult with subject matter experts to help you to develop your migration strategy. Coupling links and Server Time Protocol All external coupling links can be used to pass time synchronization signals by using Server Time Protocol (STP). STP is a message-based protocol in which timing messages are passed over data links between servers. The same coupling links can be used to exchange time and CF messages in a Parallel Sysplex. The use of the coupling links to exchange STP messages has the following advantages: \u0002 By using the same links to exchange STP messages and CF messages in a Parallel Sysplex, STP can scale with distance.

This advantage is an enhancement over the IBM Sysplex Timer implementation, which does not scale with distance. \u0002 Coupling links also provide the connectivity that is necessary in a Parallel Sysplex. Therefore, a potential benefit can be realized of minimizing the number of cross-site links that is required in a multi-site Parallel Sysplex. Between any two servers that are intended to exchange STP messages, configure each server so that at least two coupling links exist for communication between the servers. This configuration prevents the loss of one link from causing the loss of STP communication between the servers.

The lowest-numbered subchannel is subchannel 0, and the highest-numbered subchannel includes a subchannel number equal to one less than the maximum numbers of subchannels that are supported by the subchannel set. Therefore, a subchannel number is always unique within a subchannel set of a channel subsystem and depends on the sequence of assigning.

Also, it is necessary to ensure that a message cannot be corrupted (message integrity), while ensuring that the sender and the receiver really are the persons who they claim to be.

Cryptography is used to meet the following requirements: \u0002 Data protection The protection of data usually is the main concept that is associated with cryptography. Only authorized persons should be able to read the message or get information about it. Data is encrypted by using a known algorithm and secret keys, such that the intended party can de-scramble the data, but an interloper cannot. This concept is also referred to as confidentiality. \u0002 Authentication (identity validation) This process decides whether the communication partners are who they claim to be, which can be done by using certificates and signatures.

Adhering to Kerckhoffs\u2019 Principle is done for the following reasons: \u0002 It is much more difficult to keep an algorithm secret than a key. \u0002 It is harder to exchange a compromised algorithm than to exchange a compromised key. \u0002 Secret algorithms can be reconstructed by reverse engineering software or hardware implementations. \u0002 Errors in public algorithms can generally be found more easily, when many experts examine it. \u0002 In history, most secret encryption methods proved to be weak and inadequate. \u0002 When a secret encryption method is used, it is possible that a back door was built",

Also, the method can be more thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 6.2.3 Keys The keys that are used for the cryptographic algorithms often are sequences of numbers and characters, but can also be any other sequence of bits. The length of a key influences the security (strength) of the cryptographic method. The longer the used key, the more difficult it is to compromise a cryptographic algorithm. For example, the DES (symmetric key) algorithm uses keys with a length of 56 bits, Triple-DES (TDES) uses keys with a length of 112 bits, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses keys of 128, 192, 256, or 512 bits.

Depending on the values that are passed to this function, it encrypts or decrypts the data. Asymmetric algorithms are also known as public key algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms use complex calculations and are relatively slow (about 100 - 1000 times slower than symmetric algorithms).

When a Crypto Express8S (or Crypto Express7S or Crypto Express6S) feature is removed concurrently, the PCIe adapter numbers are automatically freed. The definition of domain indexes and PCIe cryptographic adapter numbers in the candidate list for each LPAR must be planned to allow for nondisrruptive changes. Consider",

The form of the text can vary according to use and application. One of the classic examples is a 16-digit credit card number. After VFPE is used to encrypt a credit card number, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications. VFPE allows customers to add encryption to their applications in such a way that the encrypted data can flow through their systems without requiring a massive redesign of their application. In our example, if the credit card number is VFPE-encrypted at the point of entry, the cipher text still behaves as a credit card number. It can flow through business logic until it meets a back-end transaction server that can VFPE-decrypt it to get the",

A TKE workstation is part of a customized solution for the use of the Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility for z/OS (ICSF for z/OS) or Linux for IBM Z. This program provides a basic key management system for the cryptographic keys of a IBM z16 A02 or IBM z16 AGZ that has Crypto Express features installed. TKE provides compliant-level hardware-based HSM management mechanisms that clients want or must use when managing IBM Z and LinuxONE Crypto Express Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). TKE also provides mechanisms that simplify HSM management in complex IBM z Systems and LinuxONE cryptographic environments as much as regulations and policy will allow. The TKE does not have to be in the same location as the IBM Z or LinunxONE system that has the HSMs. However, the users need to have physical access to the TKE when managing IBM Z or LinuxONE HSMs. The TKE product is a Workstation with an HSM running a",

Thus the detection of unauthorized changes to software executables is enabled, and if any component is found to be modified, the system will halt the boot process, preventing any malicious code from executing. With Validated Boot customers are able to meet regulatory compliance required for certain secure software deployment scenarios.

When z/TPF is running in a shared processor configuration, the achieved MIPS is higher when z/TPF is using a minimum set of processors. In low-utilization periods, z/TPF minimizes the processor footprint by compressing TPF workload onto a minimal set of I-streams (engines), which reduces the effect on other LPARs and allows the entire CPC to operate more efficiently. As a consequence, z/OS and z/VM experience less contention from the z/TPF system when the z/TPF system is operating at periods of low demand. The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 249 and Table 7-4 on page 250. Important: z16 M/T 3932 users must use the FIXCATs for both the 3932 and the 3931.

Transactional Execution3 Transactional Execution (TX) is known in academia and industry as hardware transactional memory. Transactional execution is implemented on IBM Z servers. This feature enables software to indicate to the hardware the beginning and end of a group of instructions that must be treated in an atomic way. All of their results occur or none occur, in true transactional style. The execution is optimistic. The hardware provides a memory area to record the original contents of affected registers and memory as instruction execution occurs. If the transactional execution group is canceled or must be rolled back, the hardware transactional memory is used to reset the values. Software can implement a fallback capability. This capability increases the software\u2019s efficiency by providing a way to avoid locks (lock elision). This advantage is of special importance for speculative code generation and",

The number of threads is limited by IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ to two threads. If the underlying hardware does not support SMT, a core is limited to one thread. \u0002 CPU: This value is the default. It specifies that z/OS should configure a traditional processor view of CPU and not use SMT. \u0002 CORE,CPU_OK: This value specifies that z/OS should configure a processor view of core (as with the CORE value) but the CPU parameter is accepted as an alias for applicable",

When PROCVIEW CORE or CORE,CPU_OK are specified in z/OS that is running on an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ, HiperDispatch is forced to run as enabled, and you cannot disable HiperDispatch. The PROCVIEW statement cannot be changed dynamically; therefore, you must re-IPL after changing it to make the new setting effective. The MT_ZIIP_MODE parameter in the IEAOPTxx controls zIIP SMT mode. It can be 1 (the default), where only one thread can be running in a core, or 2, where up two threads can be running in a core. If PROCVIEW CPU is specified, the MT_ZIIP_MODE is always 1. Otherwise, the use of SMT to dispatch two threads in a single zIIP logical processor (MT_ZIIP_MODE=2) can be changed dynamically by using the SET OPT=xx setting in the IEAOPTxx parmlib.

Extended distance FICON An enhancement to the industry-standard FICON architecture (FC-SB-3) helps avoid degradation of performance at extended distances by implementing a new protocol for persistent IU pacing. Extended distance FICON is transparent to operating systems and applies to all FICON Express32S, FICON Express16SA, and FICON Express16S+ features that carry native FICON traffic (CHPID type FC).

The CCW operation ends when the CCW count goes to zero or the last MIDAW (with the last flag) ends. The combination of the address and count in a MIDAW cannot cross a page boundary.

The scatter-read or scatter-write effect of the MIDAWs makes it possible to efficiently send small control blocks that are embedded in a disk record to separate buffers from those that are used for larger data areas within the record.

Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here. VSAM and non-VSAM (DSORG=PS) sets can be defined as EF data sets. For non-VSAM data sets, a 32-byte suffix is appended to the end of every physical record (that is, block) on disk. VSAM appends the suffix to the end of every control interval (CI), which normally corresponds to a physical record. A 32 K CI is split into two records to span tracks. This suffix is used to improve data reliability, and facilitates other functions that are described next. Therefore, for example, if the DCB BLKSIZE or VSAM CI size is equal to 8192, the actual block on storage consists of 8224 bytes. The control unit does not distinguish between suffixes and user data. The suffix is transparent to the access",

In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following functions: \u0002 DFSMS striping \u0002 Access method compression \u0002 Extended addressability (EA) EA is useful for creating large Db2 partitions (larger than 4 GB). Striping can be used to increase sequential throughput, or to spread random I/Os across multiple logical volumes. DFSMS striping is useful for using multiple channels in parallel for one data set. The Db2 logs are often striped to optimize the performance of Db2 sequential inserts. Processing an I/O operation to an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set. With MIDAW, the additional CCW for the EF data set suffix is eliminated. MIDAWs benefit EF and non-EF data sets. For example, to read 12 4 K records from a non-EF data set on a 3390 track, Media Manager chains together 12 CCWs by using data chaining.

Most disk I/Os in the system are generated by using Media Manager. Users of the Executing Fixed Channel Programs in Real Storage (EXCPVR) instruction can construct channel programs that contain MIDAWs.

Soft capping controls the maximum 4-hour rolling average usage (the last 4-hour average value at every 5-minute interval), but does not limit the maximum instantaneous partition use. You can also use an LPAR group capacity limit, which sets soft capping by PR/SM for a group of logical partitions that are running z/OS.

Changing from one to another requires stopping the active one before the inactive one can be activated. This operation decreases the current capacity during the change. The provisioning management routines can interrogate the installed offerings, their content, and the status of the content of the offering. To avoid the decrease in capacity, create only one On/Off CoD offering on the system by specifying the maximum allowable capacity.

Although Parallel Sysplex clustering technology is the best continuous availability solution for z/OS environments, nondisruptive upgrades within a single system can avoid system outages and cover non-z/OS operating systems. IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ allow concurrent upgrades, which means that dynamically adding capacity to the system is possible. If the operating system images that run on the upgraded system do not require disruptive tasks to use the new capacity, the upgrade is also nondisruptive. This process avoids power-on resets (POR), LPAR deactivation, and IPLs.

RAS can be accomplished with improved concurrent replace, repair, and upgrade functions for processors, memory, drawers, and I/O. RAS also extends to the nondisruptive capability for installing Licensed Internal Code (LIC) updates. In most cases, a capacity upgrade can be concurrent without a system outage. As an extension to the RAS capabilities, environmental controls are implemented in the system to help reduce power consumption and meet cooling requirements.

You can use the IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ with carry forward HMCs and no initial order of FC 0129 (HMA for IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ). Order and install of the HMA FC 0129 is possible at a later time as an upgrade. Important: With the IBM Hardware Management Appliance, shutdown or restart of the HMC which has the Primary SE code as guest, restarts also the Primary SE code. Just an application restart of the HMC is not disruptive to the guest SE code. Recommendation: It is recommended to limit the number of HMA instances per location or datacenter to two (2).

Multi-factor authentication first factor is login and password; the second factor is TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) that is sent to your smartphone, desktop, or app (for example, Google Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password.

You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server. When an LPAR is active and an operating system is running in it, you can use the HMC to dynamically change certain LPAR parameters.

Hardware Management Console and Support Element 427 Remote Code Load (RCL) The Remote Code Load for IBM Z allows IBM to upgrade a machine remotely by working with the client to schedule a date and time for the code load and monitor the process to make sure it completes successfully. This feature allows you to schedule one or multiple Single Step Code Load for an HMC or SE. On an IBM z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ system with the HMA feature, RCL can be scheduled to update both HMCs and the firmware will automatically manage Alternate SE switches to ensure each HMC can be updated without the Primary SE being present. In general you first have to generate a token on the HMC task Manage Remote Firmware Updates. Afterwards you can schedule a RCL on Resource Link -> Fixes -> Licensed internal code -> Remote Code Load request.

When the Preferred Time Server (PTS/CTS) detects a checkstop condition, the CEC informs its SE and HMC. 2. The PTS SE recognizes the checkstop pending condition, and calls the PTS SE STP code. 3. The PTS SE sends an ECAR request thorough HMC to the Backup Time Server (BTS) SE. 4. The BTS SE communicates with the BTS to start the takeover. ECAR support is faster than the original CAR support because the console path changes from a 2-way path to a 1-way path. Also, almost no lag time is incurred between the system checkstop and the start of CAR processing. Because the request is generated from the PTS before system logging, it avoids the potential of recovery being held up.

The IBM z16 A02 support ASHRAE1 Class A3 guidelines, which recommends a (long-term) ambient temperature range of 18\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F) - 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F). The minimum allowed ambient temperature is 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) and the maximum allowed temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). The system requires chilled air to fulfill the air-cooling requirements. The airflow is from the front of the frame (intake, chilled air) to the rear (exhausts, warm air) of the frame. The chilled air is provided through perforated floor panels in front of the system.

The zEDC Express feature was adopted by enterprises because it helps with software costs for compression/decompression operations (by offloading these operations), and increases data encryption (compression before encryption) efficiency. With z15, the zEDC Express functionality was moved off from the PCIe infrastructure into the processor nest.

These instructions are composed of various paths through the operating system, subsystems, and application. The total count of instructions that are run across these software components is referred to as the transaction or job path length. The path length varies for each transaction or job, and depends on the complexity of the tasks that must be run. For a particular transaction or job, the application",

The interaction of all these factors results in a net RNI for the workload, which in turn directly relates to the performance of the workload. These factors are tendencies, not absolutes. For example, a workload might have a low I/O rate, intensive processor use, and a high locality of reference, which all suggest a low RNI. However, it might be competing with many other applications within the same LPAR and many other LPARs on the processor, which tends to create a higher RNI.

An application type is whatever is necessary to do the job. The data reference pattern and processor usage tend to be inherent to the nature of the application. The LPAR configuration and application mix are mostly a function of what must be supported on a system. The I/O rate can be influenced somewhat through buffer pool tuning.

In the LSPR, the number of address spaces for each processor type and n-way configuration is tuned to be consistent with what is needed to support the workload.

By using the RNI and another factor from CPU MF, the L1MP (percentage of data and instruction references that miss the L1 cache), a workload can be classified as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH RNI. This classification and resulting hit are automated in the zPCR tool. It is preferable to use zPCR for capacity sizing. Starting with z/OS V2R1 with APAR OA43366, zFS file is not required any more for CPU MF and Hardware Instrumentation Services (HIS). HIS is a z/OS function that collects hardware event data for processors in SMF records type 113, and a z/OS UNIX System Services output files. Only SMF 113 record is required to know proper workload type by using CPU MF counter data. CPU overhead of CPUMF is minimal. Also, the amount of SMF 113 record is 1% of typical SMF 70 and 72 which RMF writes. CPU MF and HIS can use not only for deciding workload type but also use another purpose.

Workloads that are migrating from z14 ZR1s and previous generations to z16 A02 and IBM z16 AGZ can expect to see similar results with slightly less variability than the typical z14 ZR1 experience. The effect of this variability is increased deviations of workloads from single-number metric-based factors, such as millions of instructions per second (MIPS), MSUs, and CPU time charge-back algorithms. Experience demonstrates that IBM Z servers can be run at up to 100% utilization levels, sustained. However, most clients prefer to leave some room and run at 90% or slightly under. For any capacity comparison exercise that uses a single metric, such as MIPS or MSU, is not a valid method.

As described in 12.7, \u201cCPU MF counter data and LSPR workload type\u201d on page 463, the capacity of the processor is different from the LSPR workload type. By collecting the CPU MF SMF 113 record, you can recognize the workload type in a specific IBM-provided capacity planning tool. Therefore, collecting CPU MF counter data is a first step to begin the capacity planning. 12.9.2 Creating EDF file with CP3KEXTR EDF file is an input file of the IBM Z capacity planning tool.

Hiperdispatch optimizes processor cache usage by creating an affinity between a PU and the workload. \u0002 Assign an appropriate number of logical CPs. If you assign too many logical CPs to the LPAR, unnecessary LPAR management cost is exhausted. This issue reduces the efficiency of the cache. The capacity declines relative to the LCP:RCP ratio (sum of logical CPs defined in all LPARs: the number of physical CPs on your configuration).
