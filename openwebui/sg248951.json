With up to 40 TB of main storage and enhanced SMT, the performance of the IBM z16 A01 processors deliver considerable improvement. Uniprocessor performance also increased significantly. An IBM z16 Model 701 offers average performance improvements of up to 11% over the IBM z15 Model 701.2 The Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and IBM Z Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) processor units on the IBM z16 can be configured to run two simultaneous threads in a single processor (SMT). This feature increases the capacity of these processors with 25% in average2 over processors that are running single thread. SMT is",

The initial implementation for PTP connectivity is provided by using the IBM Z Support Element (SE). On IBM z16, the external time source (PTP or NTP) is connected directly to the CPC and bypasses the SE connection. This IBM z16 feature allows more accurate sync with the external time source. The accuracy of an STP-only CTN is improved by using an NTP or PTP server with the PPS output signal as the External Time Source (ETS). Devices with PPS output are available from several vendors that offer network timing solutions. Consider the following points: \u0002 A redesigned card combines the BMC and OSC that are implemented with IBM z16 Model A01. The internal physical cards (BMC and OSC) are separate, but combined as a single FRU because of a packaging design. \u0002 Two local redundant oscillator cards are available per CPC drawer, each with one PPS port",

Central processor complex hardware components 45 Model Upgrades During a model upgrade, adding a CPC drawer is a concurrent operation4. Adding physical memory to the added drawer is also concurrent. If all or part of the added memory is enabled for use, it might become available to an active LPAR if the partition includes defined reserved storage. (For more information, see 3.7.3, \u201cReserved storage\u201d on page 126.) Alternatively, the added memory can be used by a defined LPAR that is activated after the memory is added. 2.5.5 Drawer replacement and memory With EDA, which is supported for IBM z16 A01, sufficient resources must be available to accommodate resources that are rendered unavailable when a CPC drawer is removed for upgrade or repair. For more information, see 2.7.1, \u201cRedundant I/O interconnect\u201d on page 52. Removing a CPC drawer often results in removing active memory. With the",

      "content": "serviceability IBM Z servers continue to deliver enterprise class RAS with IBM z16. The main philosophy behind RAS is about preventing or tolerating (masking) outages. It is also about providing the necessary instrumentation (in hardware, LIC and microcode, and software) to capture or collect the relevant failure information to help identify an issue without requiring a re-creation of the event. These outages can be planned or unplanned, as shown in the following examples: \u0002 An unplanned outage because of loss of cache coherency \u0002 An unplanned outage because of a firmware problem \u0002 A planned outage for a disruptive firmware upgrade \u0002 A planned outage to add physical memory to a single CPC drawer configuration The IBM Z hardware has decades of intense engineering behind it, which results in a robust and reliable platform. The hardware has many RAS features that are built into it. For more information, see Chapter 9, \u201cReliability, availability, and serviceability\u201d on page 379. 2.6.1 RAS",

Removing a CPC drawer without affecting the workload requires sufficient resources in the remaining CPC drawer. Before removing the CPC drawer, the contents of the PUs and memory of the drawer must be relocated. PUs must be available on the remaining CPC drawers to replace the deactivated drawer. Also, sufficient redundant memory must be available if no degradation of applications is allowed. To ensure that the CPC configuration supports removal of a CPC drawer with minimal effect on the workload, consider the flexible memory option. Any CPC drawer can be replaced, including the first CPC drawer that initially contains the HSA. Removal of a CPC drawer also removes the CPC drawer connectivity to the PCIe I/O drawers, and coupling links. The effect of the removal of the CPC drawer on the system is limited by the use of redundant I/O interconnect. (For more information, see 2.7.1,",

Figure 2-30 Radiator Cooling Unit The closed water loop in the radiator unit is shown in Figure 2-31. The warm water that is exiting from the PU DCMs cold plates enters pumps through a common manifold and is pumped through a heat exchanger where heat is extracted by the air flowing across the heat exchanger fins. The cooled water is then recirculated back into the PU DCMs cold plates.

Although large caches mean increased access latency, the new technology 7 nm EUV chip lithography and the lower cycle time allows IBM z16 servers to increase the size of L2 cache level within the PU chip. To overcome the inherent delays of the SMP CPC drawer design and save cycles to access the remote virtual L4 content, the system keeps instructions and data as close to the processors as possible. This configuration can be managed by directing as much work of a specific LPAR workload to the processors in the same CPC drawer as the L4 virtual cache.

Enhanced branch prediction If the branch prediction logic of the microprocessor makes the wrong prediction, all instructions in the parallel pipelines are removed. The wrong branch prediction is expensive in a high-frequency processor design. Therefore, the branch prediction techniques that are used are important to prevent as many wrong branches as possible. 84 IBM z16 (3931) Technical Guide For this reason, various history-based branch prediction mechanisms are used, as shown in the in-order part of the IBM z16 PU core logical diagram in Figure 3-11. The branch target buffer (BTB) runs ahead of instruction cache prefetches to prevent branch misses in an early stage. Furthermore, a branch history table (BHT) offers a high branch prediction success rate in combination with a pattern history table (PHT) and the use of tagged multi-target",

The IBM Integrated Accelerator for Z Sort feature termed as \u201cZSORT\u201d helps to reduce the CPU costs and improve the elapsed time for eligible workloads. One of the primary requirements for ZSORT is providing enough virtual, real, and auxiliary storage. Sort jobs that run in memory-constrained environments in which the amount of memory that is available to be used by DFSORT jobs is restricted might not achieve optimal performance results or might not be able to use ZSORT. The 64-bit memory objects (above-the-bar-storage) can use the ZSORT accelerator for sort workloads for optimal results. Because ZSORT is part of the CPU and memory latency is much less than disk latency, sorting in memory is more efficient than sorting with memory and disk workspace. By allowing ZSORT to process the input completely in memory, it can achieve the best results in elapsed time and CPU time. Because the goal of",

Therefore, a multi-pronged strategy for branch prediction is implemented on each core based on gathered branch history that is combined with other prediction mechanisms. The BHT (Branch History Table) implementation on processors provides a large performance improvement. Originally introduced on the IBM ES/9000 9021 in 1990, the BHT is continuously improved. It offers significant branch performance benefits. The BHT allows each PU to take instruction branches that are based on a stored BHT, which improves processing times for calculation routines. In addition to the BHT, IBM z16 servers use the following techniques to improve the prediction of the correct branch to be run: \u0002 BTB \u0002 PHT \u0002 CTB The success rate of branch prediction contributes significantly to the superscalar aspects of IBM z16 processor.

This process causes a 0C1 or 0C4 abend. Random branches are difficult to diagnose because clues about how the system got to that point are not evident. With the wild branch hardware facility, the last address from which a successful branch instruction was run is kept. z/OS uses this information with debugging aids, such as the SLIP command, to determine from where a wild branch came. It also can collect data from that storage location.

To increase the working set representation in the TLB without enlarging the TLB, large (1 MB) page and giant page (2 GB) support is available and can be used when suitable.

Workload deployed in z/OS Container Extensions is zIIP eligible. How zIIPs work zIIPs are designed for supporting designated z/OS workloads. One of the workloads is Java code execution. When Java code must be run (for example, under control of IBM WebSphere), the z/OS JVM calls the function of the zIIP. The z/OS dispatcher then suspends the JVM task on the CP that it is running on and dispatches it on an available zIIP. After the Java application code execution is finished, z/OS redispatches the JVM task on an available CP. After this process occurs, normal processing is resumed. This process reduces the CP time that is needed to run Java WebSphere applications, which frees that capacity for other workloads. 6 IBM z Systems Application Assist Processors (zAAPs) are not available since IBM z14 servers.

These improvements are because DAT and memory operations are part of processor busy time, even though the processor waits for memory operations to complete without processing anything else in the meantime.

It relies on Coupling Thin Interrupts to dispatch the image again in a timely fashion when new work (or new signals) arrives at the CF to be processed. With IBM z16, DYNDISP=THIN is the only mode of operation for CF images that use shared processors. This capability allows ICF engines to be shared by several CF images. In this environment, it provides faster and far more consistent CF service times. It can also provide performance that is reasonably close to dedicated-engine CF performance. The use of Thin Interrupts allows a CF to run by using a shared processor while maintaining good performance. The shared engine is allowed to be undispatched when no more work exists, as in the past. The Thin Interrupt gets the shared processor that is dispatched when a command or duplexing signal is presented to the shared engine. This function saves processor cycles and is an excellent option to be used by a production backup CF or a testing",

On IBM z16 A01, the CPC drawers can hold up to 48 PCIe fan-out cards (four-CPC drawers configuration). Adapter ID number assignment PCIe fan-outs and ports are identified by an Adapter ID (AID) that is initially dependent on their physical locations, which is unlike channels that are installed in a PCIe+ I/O drawer. Those channels are identified by a physical channel ID (PCHID) number that is related to their physical location. This AID must be used to assign a CHPID to the fan-out in the IOCDS definition. The CHPID assignment is done by associating the CHPID to an AID port (see Table 4-2. Table 4-2 Fan-out locations and their AIDs for the CPC drawer (IBM z16 A01) Fan-out slots The fan-out slots are numbered LG01 - LG12 (from left to right), as listed in Table 4-2.",

Identified by the PNETID parameter, each ISM VCHID defines an isolated, internal virtual network for SMC-D communication, without any hardware component required. Virtual adapters are defined by virtual function (VF) statements. Multiple LPARs can access the same virtual network for SMC-D data exchange by associating their VF with same VCHID. Applications that use HiperSockets can realize network latency and CPU reduction benefits and performance improvement by using the SMC-D over ISM. IBM z16 servers support up to 32 ISM VCHIDs per CPC. Each VCHID supports up to 255 VFs, with a total maximum of 8,000 VFs. Shared Memory Communications Version 2 Shared Memory Communications v2 is available in z/OS V2R4 (with PTFs) and z/OS V2R5.

The IC link is an IBM Z coupling connectivity option that enables high-speed, efficient communication between a CF partition and one or more z/OS logical partitions that are running on the same CPC. The IC is a linkless connection (implemented in LIC) and does not require any hardware or cabling. An IC link is a fast coupling link that uses memory-to-memory data transfers. IC links do not have PCHID numbers, but do require CHPIDs.",

Secure keys are processed on the PCIeCC adapters (HSMs)3. This process requires an asynchronous operation to move the data and keys from the general-purpose central processor (CP) to the crypto adapters. Clear keys process faster than secure keys because the process is done synchronously on the CPACF. Protected keys blend the security of Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Crypto Express6S coprocessors and the performance characteristics of the CPACF. This process allows it to run closer to the speed of clear keys. CPACF facilitates the continued privacy of cryptographic key material when used for data encryption. In Crypto Express8S, Crypto Express7S, or Express6S coprocessors, a secure key is encrypted under a master key.

After VFPE is used to encrypt a credit card number, the resulting cipher text is another 16-digit number. This process helps older databases contain encrypted data of sensitive fields without having to restructure the database or applications. VFPE allows customers to add encryption to their applications in such a way that the encrypted data can flow through their systems without requiring a massive redesign of their application. In our example, if the credit card number is VFPE-encrypted at the point of entry, the cipher text still behaves as a credit card number. It can flow through business logic until it meets a back-end transaction server that can VFPE-decrypt it to get the original credit card number to process the transaction.

In low-use periods, z/TPF minimizes the processor footprint by compressing TPF workload onto a minimal set of I-streams (engines), which reduces the effect on other LPARs and allows the entire CPC to operate more efficiently. As a consequence, z/OS and z/VM experience less contention from the z/TPF system when the z/TPF system is operating at periods of low demand. Chapter 7. Operating system support 271 The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-3 on page 253 and Table 7-4 on page 254. zIIP support zIIPs do not change the model capacity identifier of IBM z16 servers.

Each core has a single dispatch vector, and z/VM attempts to place virtual sibling IFLs on the same dispatch vector to maximize cache reuses. z/VM guests have no awareness of SMT, and cannot use it directly. z/VM SMT use does not include guest support for multithreading. The value of this support for guests is that the first-level z/VM host of the guests can achieve higher throughput from the multi-threaded IFL cores.

Because the most significant performance benefit of MIDAWs is achieved with EF data sets, a brief review of the EF data sets is included here. VSAM and non-VSAM (DSORG=PS) sets can be defined as EF data sets. For non-VSAM data sets, a 32-byte suffix is appended to the end of every physical record (that is, block) on disk. VSAM appends the suffix to the end of every control interval (CI), which normally corresponds to a physical record. A 32 K CI is split into two records to span tracks. This suffix is used to improve data reliability, and facilitates other functions that are described next. For example, if the DCB BLKSIZE or VSAM CI size is equal to 8192, the block on storage consists of 8224 bytes. The control unit does not distinguish between suffixes and user data. The suffix is transparent to the access method and database. In addition to reliability, EF data sets enable the following",

DFSMS striping is useful for the use of multiple channels in parallel for one data set. The Db2 logs are often striped to optimize the performance of Db2 sequential inserts. Processing an I/O operation to an EF data set normally requires at least two CCWs with data chaining. One CCW is used for the 32-byte suffix of the EF data set.

The supported operating systems are listed in Table 7-6 on page 257. Health Check for FICON Dynamic routing Starting with IBM z13, the channel microcode was changed to support FICON dynamic routing. Although change is required in z/OS to support dynamic routing, I/O errors can occur if the FICON switches are configured for dynamic routing despite the missing support in the processor or storage controllers. Therefore, a health check is provided that interrogates the switch to determine whether dynamic routing is enabled in the switch fabric. No action is required on z/OS to enable the health check; it is automatically enabled at IPL and reacts to changes that might cause problems. The health check can be disabled by using the PARMLIB or SDSF modify commands.",

IBM includes a stand-alone tool to assist with this planning before the installation. The capabilities of the WWPN are extended to calculate and show WWPNs for virtual and physical ports ahead of system installation. The tool assigns WWPNs to each virtual FCP channel or port by using the same WWPN assignment algorithms that a system uses when assigning WWPNs for channels that use NPIV. Therefore, the SAN can be set up in advance, which allows operations to proceed much faster after the server is installed. In addition, the SAN configuration can be retained instead of altered by assigning the WWPN to physical FCP ports when a FICON feature is replaced. The WWPN tool takes a .csv file that contains the FCP-specific I/O device definitions",

The associated TCP/IP connection was limited to hosts within a single IP subnet that required the hosts to have direct access to the same physical layer 2 network (that is, the same Ethernet LAN over a single VLAN ID). The scope of eligible TCP/IP connections for SMC was limited to and defined by the single IP subnet. SMC Version 2 (SMCv2) provides support for SMC over multiple IP subnets for both SMC-D and SMC-R and is referred to as SMC-Dv2 and SMC-Rv2. SMCv2 requires updates to the underlying network technology. SMC-Dv2 requires ISMv2 and SMC-Rv2 requires RoCEv2. The SMCv2 protocol is downward compatible, which allows SMCv2 hosts to continue to communicate with SMCv1 previous hosts. Although SMCv2 changes the SMC connection protocol to enable multiple IP subnet support, SMCv2 does not change how user TCP socket data is transferred, which preserves the benefits of SMC to TCP",

This approach allows multiple concurrent z/OS processing threads to process each unique input queue (workload), which avoids traditional resource contention. IWQ reduces the conventional z/OS processing that is required to identify and separate unique workloads. This advantage results in improved overall system performance and scalability. A primary objective of IWQ is to provide improved performance for business-critical interactive workloads by reducing contention that is created by other types of workloads.

On/Off Capacity on Demand Represents a function that allows spare capacity in a CPC to be made available to increase the total capacity of a CPC. For example, On/Off CoD can be used to acquire capacity for handling a workload peak. Permanent capacity The capacity that a client purchases and activates. This amount might be less capacity than the total capacity purchased. Permanent upgrade LICC that is licensed by IBM to enable the activation of applicable computing resources, such as processors or memory, for a specific CIU-eligible system on a permanent basis.

An upgrade changes the DIMM sizes and adding DIMMs in all available slots in the processor drawer. You also can add memory by concurrently adding a second processor drawer with sufficient memory into the configuration and then, using LICCC to enable that memory. Changing DIMMs in a single CPC drawer system is disruptive. An LPAR can dynamically take advantage of a memory upgrade if reserved storage is defined to that LPAR. The reserved storage is defined to the LPAR as part of the image profile. Reserved memory can be configured online to the LPAR by using the LPAR dynamic storage reconfiguration (DSR) function. DSR allows a z/OS operating system image and z/VM partitions to add reserved storage to their",

Capacity tokens were introduced to provide better control over resource consumption when On/Off CoD offerings are activated.

Figure 8-11 On/Off CoD order example The example order that is shown in Figure 8-11 is an On/Off CoD order for 0% more CP capacity (system is at capacity level 7), and for two more ICFs and two more zIIPs. The maximum number of CPs, ICFs, zIIPs, and IFLs is limited by the current number of available unused PUs of the installed processor drawers. The maximum number of SAPs is determined by the model number and the number of available PUs on the already installed processor drawers. To finalize the order, you must accept Terms and Conditions for the order, as shown in Figure 8-12.

The provisioning management routines can interrogate the installed offerings, their content, and the status of the content of the offering. To avoid the decrease in capacity, create only one On/Off CoD offering on the system by specifying the maximum allowable capacity. Then, when an activation is needed, the CPM can activate a subset of the contents of the offering sufficient to satisfy the demand. If more capacity is needed later, the Provisioning Manager can activate more capacity up to the maximum allowed increase. Multiple offering records can be pre-staged on the SE HDD. Changing the content of the offerings (if necessary) also is possible. The CPM operates based on Workload Manager (WLM) indications, and the construct that is used is the Performance Index (PI) of a service class period.

If the required CBU capacity changes the capacity setting of the CPs, going from model capacity identifier 402 to a CBU configuration of a four-way 504 requires four CBU feature codes with a capacity setting of 5yy. If the capacity setting of the CPs is changed, more CBU features are required, not more physical PUs. Therefore, your CBU contract requires more CBU features when the capacity setting of the CPs is changed. CBU can add CPs through LICCC only, and the IBM z16 A01 must have the correct number of installed processor drawers to allow the required upgrade. CBU can change the model capacity identifier to a higher value than the base setting (4xx, 5yy, or 6yy), but the CBU feature cannot decrease the capacity setting. A CBU contract must be in place before the special code that enables this capability can be installed on the system. CBU features can be added to an IBM z16 nondisruptively. For each",

All rights reserved. 379 Chapter 9. Reliability, availability, and serviceability From the quality perspective, the IBM z16 reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) design is driven by a set of high-level program RAS objectives. The IBM Z platform continues to drive toward Continuous Reliable Operation (CRO) at the single footprint level. The key objectives, in order of priority, are to ensure data integrity, computational integrity, reduce or eliminate unscheduled outages, reduce scheduled outages, reduce planned outages, and reduce the number of Repair Actions. RAS can be accomplished with improved concurrent replace, repair, and upgrade functions for processors, memory, drawers, and I/O. RAS also extends to the nondisruptive capability for installing Licensed Internal Code (LIC) updates. In most cases, a capacity upgrade can be",

The IBM z16 design phase focuses on enhancing planning to simplify or eliminate planned outages. The difference between scheduled outages and planned outages might not be obvious. The general consensus is that scheduled outages occur sometime soon. The timeframe is approximately two weeks. Planned outages are outages that are planned well in advance and go beyond this approximate two-week timeframe. This chapter does not distinguish between scheduled and planned outages. Preventing unscheduled, scheduled, and planned outages was addressed by the IBM Z system design for many years. IBM z16 A01 has a fixed size HSA of 256 GB. This size helps eliminate planning requirements for HSA and provides the flexibility to update dynamically the configuration.

The HMC runs a set of management applications. On IBM z16, two HMCs are delivered with the Hardware Management Appliance (HMA) feature FC 0129. The HMC code runs on the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers on the top of the IBM z16 A frame. Stand-alone outside the IBM z16 HMCs (Tower or Rack Mount) no longer can be ordered. The following HMC feature codes can be carried forward from previous orders: \u0002 FC 0062 \u0002 FC 0063 \u0002 FC 0082 \u0002 FC 0083 On the carry forward HMC features, Driver",

Also, Driver 51/Version 2.16.0 can be installed on the SE/HMC hardware that is provided with the HMA feature FC 0100 on IBM z15. You can use the IBM z16 with carry forward HMCs and no initial order of FC 0129 (HMA for IBM z16). Order of the HMA FC 0129 is possible later as MES. With IBM z16, the HMA feature shares the integrated 1U server hardware (installed on top of rack A with) the SE code. The SE code runs virtualized under the HMC on each of the two integrated 1U rack-mounted servers. One SE is the Primary SE (active) and the other is the Alternative SE (backup). As with the HMCs, the SEs are closed systems (appliances), and no other applications can be installed on the same hardware. The HMC is used to set up, manage, monitor, and operate one or more IBM Z CPCs. It manages IBM Z hardware and its logical partitions (LPARs), and provides support applications. At least one HMC is required to operate an IBM Z. An HMC can manage",

The MFA first factor is the combination of login ID and password; the second factor is TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) that is sent to your smartphone, desktop, or application (for example, Google Authenticator or IBM Verify). This TOTP is defined in RFC 6238 standard and uses a cryptographic hash function that combines a secret key with the current time to generate a one-time password.

The algorithm within the HMC that is responsible for MFA code generation changes the code every 30 seconds. However, to ease the process, the HMC and SE console accepts current, previous, and next MFA codes. It is also important to have HMC, SE, and device clocks synchronized. If the clocks are not synchronized, the MFA log-on attempt fails. Time zone differences are irrelevant because the MFA code algorithm uses UTC. On IBM z15, HMC Driver 41/Version 2.15.0 provides the integration of HMC authentication and z/OS MFA support. Therefore, RSA SecurID authentication is achieved by way of centralized support from IBM MFA for z/OS, with the MFA policy defined in RACF and the HMC IDs assigned to RACF user IDs.

This task causes a program to be read from a designated device, and starts that program. You can perform the IPL of the operating system from storage, the USB flash memory drive (UFD), or an FTP server. When an LPAR is active and an operating system is running in it, you can use the HMC to dynamically change certain LPAR parameters. The HMC provides an interface to change partition weights, add logical processors to partitions, and add memory. LPAR weights also can be changed through a scheduled operation. Use the Customize Scheduled Operations task to define the weights that are set to LPARs at the scheduled time. Channel paths can be dynamically configured on and off (as needed for each partition) from an HMC. The Change LPAR Controls task for IBM z16 can export the Change LPAR Controls table data to a comma-separated value (.csv)-formatted file. This support is",

      "content": "Recovery Enhanced Console Assisted Recovery (ECAR) speeds up the process of BTS takeover by performing the following steps: 1. When the PTS/CTS detects a checkstop condition, the CEC informs its SE and HMC. 2. The PTS SE recognizes the checkstop pending condition, and calls the PTS SE STP code. 3. The PTS SE sends an ECAR request thorough HMC to the BTS SE. 4. The BTS SE communicates with the BTS to start the takeover. ECAR support is faster than the original CAR support because the console path changes from a 2-way path to a 1-way path. Also, almost no lag time is incurred between the system checkstop and the start of CAR processing. Because the request is generated from the PTS before system logging, it avoids the potential of recovery being held up.

This configuration is implemented by using the Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol, which is an extension of SSH. You can use the Manage SSH Keys console feature that is available to the HMC and SE to import public keys that are associated with a host address. The Secure FTP infrastructure allows HMC and SE applications to query whether a public key is associated with a host address and to use the Secure FTP interface with the suitable public key for a host.

These redundant power supplies each have their own power cords, or pair of power cords, which allows the system to survive the loss of customer power to either power cord or power cord pair. If power is interrupted to one of the power supplies, the other power supply assumes the entire load and the system continues to operate without interruption. Therefore, the power cords for each power supply must be wired to support the entire power load of the system. For the most reliable availability, the power cords in the rear of the frame should be powered from different PDUs. All power cords exit through the rear of the frame. The utility current distribution across the phase conductors (phase current balance) depends on the system configuration. Each front-end power supply is provided with phase switching redundancy.

The total count of instructions that are run across these software components is referred to as the transaction or job path length.

      "content": "improvements in core and cache became the driving factor for performance gains. As these microarchitectural features increase (which contributes to instruction parallelism), overall workload performance variability also increases because not all workloads react the same way to these enhancements. Because of the nature of the IBM z16 multi-CPC drawer system and resource management across those drawers, performance variability from application to application is expected. Also, the memory and cache designs affect various workloads in many ways. All workloads are improved, with cache-intensive loads benefiting the most. For example, having more PUs per CPC drawer, each with higher capacity than IBM z15, more workload can fit on an IBM z16 CPC drawer. This configuration can result in better performance. For example, IBM z15 two drawer system model T01 can populate maximum 71 PUs (Max71). In contrast, IBM z16 two drawer system Max82 can populate maximum 82 PUs. Therefore, five and six more",

Although the zEDC PCIe feature provided CPU savings by offloading the select compression and decompression operations, it included the drawback of limited virtualization capabilities (one zEDC PCIe feature can be shared across a maximum of 15 LPARs) and limited bandwidth. IBM z15 introduced an on-chip accelerator (implemented in the PU chip) for compression and decompression operations, which was tied directly into processor\u2019s L3 cache. As a result, it provided much higher bandwidth and removed the virtualization limitations of a PCIe feature. The IBM z16 further addresses the growth of data compression requirements with the integrated on-chip compression unit (implemented in processor Nest, one per PU chip) that significantly increases compression throughput and speed compared to previous zEDC",

Batch processing also can take advantage and reduce batch windows dramatically. Without capping in place, customers can expect jobs to finish faster yet at the same cost.

IBM\u2019s answer was the introduction of zDR Cloud. This offering enables active MIPS flexibility between the production site and the DR site. It also offers greater flexibility over CBU tests for length of test execution and frequency. However, the following disadvantages must be addressed: \u0002 zDR Cloud requires an MES to run a site swap for test and CBU for unplanned site swap \u0002 Onsite IBM intervention is required, which is not COVID-safe \u0002 A 2-week lead time is required to implement, which induces delays \u0002 it is applicable only to planned site swap scenarios; therefore, DR testing and real DR scenarios are not the same, which causes compliance issues \u0002 A lack of standardization",
