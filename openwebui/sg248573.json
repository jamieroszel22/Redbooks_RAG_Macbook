Challenges and opportunities in AI governance 5 1.2.1 Concern 1: Governance is a brake on AI In some ways this is a true statement: governance does set boundaries in the application of AI and then holds people to that. But compare it to a car: what would happen if your car doesn't have brakes? How would you even make it out of your street without the precise control to stop at the first intersection? How would you drive on a highway if you could not make an emergency stop or reliably take an exit? How would you park",

Business applications typically store their data in application-specific sources, which often leads to duplication across multiple systems to meet different application needs. This fragmentation results in disconnected datasets that are not easily accessible to the broader enterprise ecosystem while still maintaining appropriate access rights. As a result, this limitation hinders opportunities for gaining insights and fostering innovation. IBM AI and data platforms enable organizations to access and integrate isolated datasets for analytics purposes, ensuring that the data is of high quality and trustworthy.

Documentation is particularly crucial for the data pile used for training the foundation model, where gathering information on data acquisition and preparation methodologies for foundation model training is essential.

These concerns extend to the software used to package and deploy these models, as well as the input data provided and the output generated. Therefore, thorough discussions with legal counsel and the model/software provider are essential. Key questions to address include: \u0002 Training Data Ownership and Licensing: Does the model provider possess clear legal rights (including ownership or valid licenses) to use all data incorporated into the model's training dataset? This is crucial for avoiding potential copyright infringement claims. \u0002 Copyrighted Material Exclusion: What specific measures has the model provider implemented to identify and exclude copyrighted material from its training data? Understanding their methodology is vital for assessing the risk of IP issues. \u0002 Customer Data Usage for Model Training: Does the model",

The Act defines a specific set of obligations for providers of general purpose AI models (as foundation models are called in its legal terminology). In addition, the European Union will provide an associated Code of Practice which is planned to be approved in or before May 2025. The obligations and the Code will give buyers some concrete expectation towards a provider of a model that's brought onto the market after the Act has gone into force (August 2024).

In addition, most of the earlier section around model licensing also applies to the vendor. One more important topic left to cover is the topic of Legal Indemnification. In law, indemnification (or an indemnity) is any undertaking by one party to protect another party of some financial burden. In AI, the usage of foundation models can expose parties to novel financial burdens. As such, a major effort has been put forth around the idea of legal indemnification",

With the AI system using a foundation model, the foundation model itself needs to be evaluated for fairness. Bias can be detected by evaluating the foundation model for differences in accuracy and performance by using social demographic-protected attributes. A model can exhibit fairness issues in various ways. If the model is looked at in isolation and without sufficient context, it might not appear to exhibit a favorable or unfavorable outcome. In other cases, the model output can decide the prioritization level and can introduce bias in the entire end-to-end process where the source of bias is tied to the model behavior.

Explainability and interpretability of these systems and the models within the system are becoming essential. There are many ways to explain these models and systems, the appropriate choice depends on the usage context and type of explanation that is needed by the consumer of the explanation. 4.3.5 Robustness An AI system is considered robust if it can continue to perform well and reliably even when faced with difficult or unexpected situations. These situations can include anything from slight changes in the data it receives to deliberate attempts to trick or manipulate the system. A robust AI system is designed to handle these challenges effectively, minimizing mistakes and providing consistent and trustworthy results. 4.3.6",

Many models are available under a \u201cfree\u201d license, but there's more to the total cost of ownership than that. What is the initial investment? \u0002 What are the initial license costs to acquire the foundation model?
