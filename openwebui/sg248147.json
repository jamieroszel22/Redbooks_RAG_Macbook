It is written for individuals who want to start quickly with z/VM and Linux, and get virtual servers up and running in a short time (days, not weeks or months). Volume 1 starts with a solution orientation, discusses planning and security, and then, describes z/VM installation methods, configuration, hardening, automation, servicing, networking, optional features, and more. It adopts a \u201ccookbook-style\u201d format that provides a concise, repeatable set of procedures for installing, configuring, administering, and maintaining z/VM. This volume also includes a chapter on monitoring z/VM and the Linux virtual servers that are hosted. Volumes 2, 3, and 4 assume that you completed all of the steps that are described in Volume 1. From that common foundation, these volumes describe how to create your own Linux virtual servers on IBM Z hardware under IBM z/VM. The cookbook",

IBM z/VM supports the Linux operating systems on IBM Z and LinuxONE servers. In this section, we describe the concepts of virtualization and cloud computing. Virtualization Virtualization is the ability of a computer system to share resources so that one physical server machine can act as many virtual servers. Unlike other hardware platforms, IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE operate on virtualized hardware by default, which results in incredible performance and efficiency. Virtualization is the way to consolidate the amount of hardware, floor space, and energy consumption in the data center. It also simplifies the procedures to provide reliable, highly available, and seamless",

In those days, enormous mainframe systems were beginning to appear at businesses and universities as the world began to adopt computerization on a large scale. Early mainframe systems were not the compact and affordable systems they are today. Because of cost and physical size, it was exceptionally rare for any organization to have more than one. To maximize the utility and return on investment, it became standard practice to provide shared access through physical terminals. Was there a better way? Engineers at IBM\u2019s Glendale development laboratory in Endicott, New York began to ponder this question and prototype methods. In 1971, IBM released a product that is considered the genesis of cloud computing; an operating system called virtual machine (VM). For",

Automated systems management and self-service functionality for common tasks, such as identity and access management, are just two of many examples. 1.2.2 The ultimate virtualization platform If someone were to tell you that they recently purchased their \u201cultimate dream car\u201d; describing a high-performance luxury-sport automobile with a multitude of premium features, you likely assume that it was an expensive purchase with expensive ongoing maintenance costs, and it might not be \\ reliable based on all the complexity.

With nearly six decades of continual optimization, enhancement, and refinement of the hardware and z/VM, the result is a premium, high-performance solution: the ultimate virtualization platform. The following most notable qualities are features: \u0002 Incredible I/O capabilities Throughput speeds approach 1 terabyte per second. Unlike other virtualization platforms, z/VM guest systems commonly use real hardware access without another software layer. The platform is referred to by many in the industry as \u201can I/O monster\u201d because of this superior quality. \u0002 Engineered for availability The hardware components in the systems are double, sometimes even triple redundant, with a mean time to failure of over 50 years.

As an alternative to cloning, automated installation or imaging is now considered the preferred practice and is covered in this publication. Attention: It is bad practice to run a z/VM system without an ESM in place to correctly encrypt passwords and ensure sufficient controls on commands and system functions. It is widely regarded as good practice for any non-production systems (such as those systems for development and testing) to be administered to a production-level standard. As such, z/VM always must be configured to use an ESM, regardless of any functional readiness or status labels.

Conceptual overview 29 1.6 Single system image design With the introduction of z/VM 6.2 in December 2011, the architecture of Linux solutions on this platform changed dramatically. It is true that Cross Systems Extensions (CSE) allowed for a type of clustering environment for Linux on z before z/VM 6.2. However, CSE was not widely used nor was the architecture completely enabled for clusters. z/VM 6.2 introduced VMSSI with LGR and brought about major changes. No longer is it true that a z/VM system is the most important \u201cobject\u201d in the hierarchy. With z/VM 6.1 and earlier, the system identifier of each z/VM system was the most important.

When the ID or VM is running CMS, issuing the LOGOFF command is analogous to cleanly shutting down and powering off a desktop or notebook computer. When the ID or VM is running Linux, issuing the LOGOFF command is analogous to pulling the electrical cord out of the outlet from a desktop computer, or ripping the battery out of a notebook that is not plugged in. The Linux file system journal is then left in an inconsistent state and the risk of file system corruption or loss of data is introduced. Consider the following information for the use of the LOGOFF command: \u2013 Use LOGOFF only with system administration VMs, such as MAINT720, MAINT, TCPMAINT, and LGLOPR. \u2013 Never use LOGOFF",

Then, we discuss of the bill of materials, which is a listing of all of the necessary resources. Next, we describes standardized conventions and good practices that should be adopted for labeling, configuring, and using system resources.

When z/VM is installed to SCSI-over-FCP disk, the use of VMSSI is not possible. In addition, a new service mode was introduced with z/VM 7.2. Called VM Centralized Service Management (VMCSM). This capability allows a single non-VMSSI system to generate service updates for other non-VMSSI systems. If you are just getting started with z/VM and were not planning to use the VMSSI feature immediately, we still encourage you to install z/VM as a VMSSI cluster with only one member node to facilitate expansion in the future.

The latest level of a distribution release is considered to be the supported level by the Linux Distribution Partners. The preferred practice for setting up VMSSI is to ensure that you are running on the latest level and that your distribution is supported by your Linux distributor. Why ECKD DASD is required If z/VM 7.2 is installed into a VMSSI, at least one extended count key data (ECKD) volume is necessary for the Persistent Data Record (PDR). If you plan to implement RACF, the database must be configured as being shared and at least two ECKD DASD volumes are necessary. Concurrent virtual and real reserve/release must always be used for the RACF database DASD when RACF is installed in A VMSSI.

The Linux behavior that is commonly referred to as swapping is the paging of data out of system memory to a block device based on least recently used (LRU) algorithms. For historical reasons, the term swap is still shown and used, but it refers to paging in Linux. Swap is also used to help delineate paging at the Linux level (swap disk), in contrast to paging at the z/VM level. z/VM includes a feature that is called virtual disks (VDisks). VDisks exist in memory but are presented to guest operating systems as disks. IBM Z memory is fast (many times faster than disk especially); therefore, the use of VDisks for swap spaces makes sense because they are so fast. Ideally, your Linux systems never have to swap, but workloads cannot be predicted so easily. Therefore, all Linux VMs must have an adequate set of swap spaces. What defines \u201can adequate set of swap space\u201d is debatable.",

With z/VM 7.2, this requirement no longer exists. \u0002 If you are migrating to z/VM 7.2 from an older version, the LPAR activation profile might be configured to define Expanded Storage, or XSTORE. As of z/VM 6.2, IBM no longer recommends XSTORE as an auxiliary paging device, and usage of XSTORE with z/VM 6.4 was at that point considered to be deprecated. The aging and filtering functions that were provided by XSTORE are now provided by z/VM\u2019s Global Aging List (GAL). If your LPAR has XSTORE that is defined for it, convert your XSTORE to real storage and then, run the system with no XSTORE at all. For example, if you ran an earlier version of z/VM in a 32 GB partition with 4 GB of XSTORE, you change to 36 GB of real storage with no XSTORE when",

Planning 49 \u0002 z/VM 7.2 changed the capabilities and effects of the CP SET RESERVED command; therefore, review the systems that you are migrating to ensure the values that are in use are still suitable. Earlier editions of z/VM sometimes failed to honor CP SET RESERVED settings for VMs, which prompted users to oversize the amount of reserved storage that they specified. z/VM 7.2 is more effective and precise in honoring reserved settings. \u0002 z/VM 7.2 also permits CP SET RESERVED for Named Saved Systems (NSS) or Discontiguous Saved Segments (DCSS). This new capability was especially intended for the MONDCSS segment. In previous z/VM releases, MONDCSS was at risk of being paged out and consequently unavailable for catching control program (CP) Monitor records under heavy storage constraint. Because CP Monitor records are especially needed when the system is under duress, IBM suggests that you establish a reserved setting for MONDCSS. Use a reserved",

Multiply your value that is calculated for I by a reserve safety margin to help to protect yourself against abends that are caused by paging space filling up.

At an absolute minimum, it is recommended that two CTC devices are connected for each SSI member through two channel paths. During the SSI installation process, you can install only two CTCs for each SSI member. If you \\ use the VMSSI feature for consolidated systems management only, two CTCs for each SSI member are sufficient. If you plan to use LGR also, plan to add a third CTC to each member node soon as the workload grows. For more information, see 5.8, \u201cAdding CTCAs to an SSI cluster\u201d on page 130.

This section describes several standardized conventions. 2.11.1 DASD volume labeling convention You must adopt a standardized convention for labeling DASD. If one or more IBM Z or LinuxONE systems exist, your IT department might use a labeling standard that determines the labels to be given to the DASD that is used by your z/VM LPARs. Each DASD includes a real device address that consists of four hexadecimal digits, and each DASD has a six character label. When assigning DASD labels, include the four-digit address in the label so that you can easily tell the address of each DASD from its label. As your workload expands and you begin to work on disk administration tasks, this information proves to be invaluable because it saves time. When followed thoroughly, this naming convention ensures that no two DASDs have the same label, which can be important, especially when an IBM z/OS LPAR can access the DASD. Sometimes, DASD is shared",

      "content": "method is simple to implement by using REXX. 2.11.5 Command retrieve convention The ability to retrieve past commands is a common tool. Often, it is helpful to retrieve in both directions if you overlook the command for which you are looking. The default Linux shell, bash, performs this task by default by using the up arrow and down arrow keys. A convention in z/VM is to use the F12 function key (labeled PF12 on physical 3270 devices) to retrieve the last command, although it is not defined to all VMs. No convention exists to retrieve commands in the other direction, but it is possible to set another key to that function. Therefore, the F11 key is used to retrieve forward because it is next to the F12 key. Also, the same function is useful in the editor, XEDIT. The ? subcommand retrieves past commands,; therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to F12. For more information about implementing this concept, see \u201cPROFILE EXEC for Linux virtual machines\u201d on page 497. 62",

Linux features its own security model, which is implemented in several kernel and file system capabilities, including the following examples: \u0002 File system permissions, and access control lists (ACLs) \u0002 Mandatory Access Control layers, such as SELinux or AppArmor \u0002 Cgroups Because Linux features its own security capability, it is tempting to consider security at the hypervisor layer to be superfluous or unnecessary.

If the hypervisor does not adequately protect the resources of one VM from another, data can be moved between VMs that are outside the control of the VM operating system. This movement of data between VMs might occur through attaching the disks of one instance to another, or by creating an isolated network connection between them. These methods might result in sensitive data (such as SPI) being exfiltrated from a high-sensitivity VM to one with a lower security profile. One way to mitigate this issue might be to create separate hypervisor instances for the different security levels in your environment. However, this process quickly leads to problems in scalability and management by forcing more hypervisor instances that might be needed",

CP enforces the definitions that are specified in the system directory for resources, such as minidisks. However, the default security includes the following weaknesses: \u0002 The source for the directory is stored on a CMS minidisk and contains passwords (for users and minidisks) that are stored in clear text \u0002 The default location of the directory source file is somewhat well-known, which leads to the possibility of the passwords becoming known \u0002 Poor granularity of resource management control \u0002 No delegation",

Password management is still a concern because a system administrator can still obtain clear-text passwords. Also, the granularity of resource access control is not improved. These points can be addressed through the use of an External Security Manager (ESM). 3.2.3 Improving z/VM security by using an External Security Manager An ESM addresses the security points by applying more security configuration and control in addition to (or instead of) standard CP security. Password management When an ESM is used, the passwords in the directory are no longer used. User passwords appear in the directory as placeholders, and minidisk passwords are ignored.

Pass phrases (as implemented in RACF) support up to 100 characters from a wider character set. The use of pass phrases instead of passwords is an important consideration that allows z/VM to integrate into a wider enterprise security environment. Note: In the past, some ESMs (including RACF) did not use strong encryption methods to protect passwords; instead, they used \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d. RACF now provides the KDFAES password encryption method, which uses much stronger encryption (backed by the hardware CPACF) to protect passwords and pass phrases. Enabling KDFAES also avoids a previous RACF restriction around pass phrase length. Pass phrases 9 - 13 characters were not supported in RACF without writing an exit to allow them. This restriction is removed when KDFAES is enabled, and pass phrases 9 - 100 characters are",

This capability is known as group-special. A user with the group-special attribute on their connection to a group can perform security operations against users in that group without having to be made a system-wide administrator. By using this mechanism, different users can be made security administrators of different parts of the z/VM environment (such as one or more Linux system administrators can be given group-special over the Linux systems they manage).

SMF on z/VM RACF provides two data disks for this purpose, and by default switches from one recording disk to the other when one fills. To ensure that it can switch back again when the second disk fills, some processing is required to clean up the data disk and prepare it for its next use.

However, many hypervisor systems are configured in that way; that is, a single ID or privilege level provides universal authority over all aspects of system management. A single focus of administration makes it far too easy for a system to be compromised through the actions of a small number of people, or even an individual. z/VM can help to separate administrative roles into separate IDs, which makes it difficult for the actions of an individual (accidental or malicious) to create a security event.

Some shared user IDs are provided as part of a z/VM system (including MAINT, MAINTvrm, TCPMAINT, product owning IDs, and service VMs). In addition, Linux guest VMs can be considered shared.

From user creation and administration to software installation and service, the MAINT ID was used for everything. If a system administrator bothered to create an ID for themselves, it generally was a copy of MAINT with all of its privilege classes copied as well.

Also, changes that are needed can often be done automatically by using tools (such as the DirMaint-RACF connector as described in \u201cDirMaint-RACF Connector\u201d on page 321) to mirror directory changes into RACF.

The extra factors can be various out-of-band techniques, including RSA SecurID, LDAP, Radius, and one-time password (OTP) systems, such as Google Authenticator. An example MFA log in to CMS might resemble the following process: 1. Access the MFA server by using a web browser. 2.

This virtualization offers the security certification EAL 4+ which is the highest level of certification and represents the highest level of isolation in virtualized environments. Because z/VM is a well-established hypervisor for the mainframe, it is a proven technology and commonly used by many customers. \u0002 Using a KVM-based deployment An alternative approach for virtualization is planned to be based on a KVM-based deployment. 4.3 Operations Manager The Operations Manager product improves the management of z/VM systems by automating tasks, responses, and sessions (see",

A detailed description is outside the scope of this book; however, short steps are documented. The steps and links might change over time, but the basic process will remain the same. You can download the z/VM product installer to a staging machine, such as a workstation, as we did in this example, and later upload them to a File Transfer Program (FTP) server. However, you can also download them directly to the machine that will be the FTP server, such as a Linux personal computer if it has access to the Internet. 5.1.1 Placing the order To order z/VM, complete the following steps: 1. Visit the z/VM Buy/Order page at the following URL: http://www.ibm.com/vm/buy/ \u2013 You might want to review the links that describe the System Delivery Offering (SDO) and Subscription and Support (S&S) so you understand the details. \u2013 When you are ready to proceed, under the heading How to",

You can adjust the FTP server configuration to present any of these paths as /ftp for a user.

This wizard is generally used only once. After IPWIZARD creates the initial configuration files, the files often are maintained manually. A temporary OSA triplet is used to get z/VM in the network. Later, the TCP/IP stack is correctly attached to a highly available z/VM Virtual Switch (VSWITCH). 5.7.1 Using the z/VM IPWIZARD tool With the IPWIZARD tool, you can quickly get z/VM onto an Internet Protocol network.

If you are manually entering the information, carefully enter the text from Example 6-9 and then, use the XEDIT block copy operation to duplicate the entire block of text for each extra LPAR in your cluster.

It does not attempt to identify problems between statements or valid but duplicate operands on a single statement. CPSYNTAX does not ensure that it finds all configuration file changes that lead to a problem during system IPL; you still must approach edits of SYSTEM CONFIG carefully to ensure that you do not make mistakes. During system IPL, configuration file post-processing routines perform more checking of the data that is specified in the configuration file. The IPL of a second-level system to check the configuration file is recommended for a more thorough test and you might find problems that CPSYNTAX did not.

Important: If your SSI is on LPARs at the first level, you must use real volumes for the 200 and 300 RACF database, they cannot be minidisks. Use the smallest volumes that you can get because the RACF database does not need many cylinders, even mod-3 is more than enough in most cases. It is not recommended to use volumes with more than 32,760 cylinders. Chapter 6.

However, more paging volumes are recommended, especially if you plan to use the z/VM memory overcommitment feature for your Linux virtual machines. Although certain volumes are shared, the page and temporary disk volumes are not. If you used 3390-9, it is recommended that you add at least one additional 3390-9 paging volume so that you will have a total of two. If you used 3390-3, add at least four additional 3390-3 paging volumes for a total of five. Adequate paging space will give you room to add more Linux virtual machines. Guidelines for planning paging were covered in 2.7, \u201cPaging\u201d on page 50. 6.11.1 Formatting volumes for page space Before you add paging volumes to the SSI cluster members, you must format the DASD volumes to be used for minidisk space (PERM) and paging space (PAGE).

This EXEC is shown in Appendix B, \u201cReference, cheat sheets, blank worksheets, and education\u201d on page 475. It is a wrapper around CPFMTXA. To use this EXEC, each DASD to be formatted must first be attached with the virtual device address and the same real device address (by using ATTACH realDev *). This EXEC will label the volumes according to the convention that is described in 2.11.1, \u201cDASD volume labeling convention\u201d on page 58. If you want different volume labels, you can use the CPFMTXA command and manually specify each volume label, or you can modify the REXX EXEC. The use of CPFMTXA manually is covered in Chapter",

PROP intercepts all messages and requests that are directed to the z/VM OPERATOR virtual machine and compares them against a routing table, which is a structured-format CMS file. When a match occurs, the defined action is performed. If no match occurs, no action is performed. Certain messages are logged. Other messages are acted on automatically. Other messages are sent to an actual operator\u2019s console that is called the logical operator console for human intervention. The major benefit of PROP is that the real system operator sees only important messages, while all messages are recorded for auditing. Complete the following steps to enable PROP: 1.

The VMLOGS VSM invokes a routine that is called SVMREST to attempt to prevent this situation. 6.13.7 Creating a console logs repository On z/VM, console logs are created each time a user ID is logged on to the system. These logs are an excellent starting point when performing problem determination on an issue or to understand a specific behavior. In this section, we describe how to create a virtual service machine that will collect and store log files that are sent to its virtual spool. It will also invoke SFPURGER and SVMREST. The installation will use the package from the z/VM downloads page, which is included in the compressed file that you downloaded earlier into SFS. This package populates a virtual machine that is named VMLOGS to act as a repository for consoles and any data file that needs to be accessible for a predetermined number of days. Logs are spooled to the VMLOGS VSM and automatically received onto the VMLOGS 191 minidisk. Files are kept until a",

Your security posture is only as strong as the weakest point, which means that the correct encryption of traffic must be implemented at all layers. Connectivity to the hypervisor layer and well-secured guests on an unsecured hypervisor are critical exposures. Furthermore, in nearly all circumstances, encrypting traffic as a default practice is common sense. Encryption requirements might also be mandated by company policy, customers, partners, vendors, industry regulations, or governing bodies. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server provides the processing capability that allows encrypted communication",

In addition, file level backup and recovery also is available for z/VM and the Linux guests, which provides easier recovery from operational errors.

This capability is known as live guest relocation (LGR). While Linux systems continue to run, they can be moved across logical partitions (LPARs) on the same central processor complex (CPC), or cross-CPC, if the SSI is set up that way. This new function allows for few or even no planned outages. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of LGR and information about how to relocate a Linux guest.

Servicing z/VM 259 8.3 Applying a recommended service upgrade Applying an RSU is similar to applying a PTF, which was described in the previous section. z/VM service can be preventive (RSU) or corrective (COR). For more information about the latest RSU content, see this web page. For more information about Red Alerts, which contain information about potential high-impact items, see this web page. Next, we summarize applying service and also describe how to obtain service over the internet by using IBM Shopz. First, you must determine whether your system needs service by using the QUERY CPLEVEL command: ==> query cplevel z/VM Version 7 Release 1.0, service level 1801 (64-bit) Generated at 09/10/20 17:34:33 EDT IPL at 09/11/20 16:34:30 EDT The service level (also called RSU level) is a four-digit field that consists of a pair of two-digit segments.

Putting the service into production. 8.3.1 Getting service from the internet An RSU is obtained by its PTF number. The PTF for the most current RSU is of the form UM97xyz where xyz is the z/VM version-release-modification level. So for z/VM 6.3, the RSU is UM97630, and for z/VM 7.2, it is UM97720.

The procedures to download and apply the service are the same as any PTF: access IBM Software Shopz website, find APARs by number, download them and apply them. 8.6 Moving on to Linux The installation, configuration, and service of z/VM are complete. With all updates applied, see Chapter 9, \u201cz/VM Centralized Service Management\u201d on page 275 for more information about z/VM management and Linux. \u00a9 Copyright IBM Corp. 2015, 2016, 2021. 275 Chapter 9. z/VM Centralized Service Management A new method of managing service for sets of stand-alone z/VM systems was introduced with z/VM 7.2.

This system is used to build service packages that are delivered to a set of defined managed systems. The z/VM CSM principal system builds service levels by using VMSES/E commands. When a system is participating in z/VM CSM, a dedicated FTP server is set up specifically for transporting service levels and the communication between principal and managed systems. A new command, SERVMGR, is used to manage z/VM CSM. SERVMGR uses VMSES/E commands to apply service and local modifications, build serviced content, and drive the transport of z/VM CSM packaged service to managed systems. z/VM CSM uses Shared File System (SFS) directories to manage service levels for the managed systems. Management of these directories is handled by SERVMGR. 9.1.1 z/VM CSM",

This process creates the SFS directory structure, and the z/VM CSM service status table. 2. A new level of service that is composted of selected IBM service deliverables or local modifications (or both) is created. The SERVICE command is used to build the service content, which is placed in a new SFS structure. 3. Systems to be managed are added to the z/VM CSM management group. Information about the systems that is managed by using z/VM CSM functions is contained in the z/VM CSM system status table. 4.

The objective of the use of online file pool operation commands was to eliminate disruption to file pool users. Because the file pool had to be shut down for the DMSPARMS file update, and the file pool change appeared to affect DirMaint, this process was not successful. An alternative process for adding file pool space, which requires the file pool to be shut down, is described in Chapter 9, \u201cAdding Minidisks in Dedicated Maintenance Mode\u201d of z/VM: CMS File Pool Planning, Administration, and Operation. 9.2.2 User ID privilege class The MAINTCSM user ID requires access to the FORCE command.

We went through the TCP/IP configuration process described in \u201cTCP/IP configuration changes\u201d on page 279, except for the FTP DATA file change, which is intended for the principal system only. We also defined the CSMSERVE ID to be an administrator of the VMPSFS file pool. For our first test, we made this definition temporarily by using the following command: ENROLL ADMINISTRATOR CSMSERVE VMPSFS: We used the SERVMGR SYSTEM ADD command to set up RDBKZVMC for VMCSM management, as shown in Example 9-17.

It also contains system and device default values that are used during allocation operations. Two main sections must be populated: Regions Defines the actual disks and their sizes to DirMaint. The AUTOR keyword can be used in user directory entries to take space from the regions. It is recommended that region name and volume label are always identical. Groups Defines pools of disks so the AUTOG keyword can be used to take space from the pools, not from specific disks.

However, for critical data files, extra security measures must be implemented. This process can be done by using an External Security Manager (ESM), such as Resource Access Control Facility (RACF). An ESM controls who can have access, and what kind of access they can have to specific data files and disks.

However, to avoid dual maintenance of password processing (and other RACF functions), complete the following steps: 1. Use the DirMaint supplied sample file CONFIGRC SAMPDVH. You must copy this file to the 7VMDIR20 11F disk as CONFIGRC DATADVH. 2. If RACF administration is centralized, you must give the DIRMAINT user ID the RACF attribute SPECIAL. If RACF administration is decentralized, you must give the DIRMAINT user ID RACF group-SPECIAL attribute. 3. If you want to record DirMaint activity in RACF SMF records, enable ESM_LOG_RECORDING_EXIT. For this change to take effect, run the DIRM RLDDATA command. 4. You must also authorize the DirMaint service machines DIRMAINT, DATAMOVE, and DIRMSAT to use the RACROUTE interface. Note: Only",

      "content": "on page 339. 10.5.3 Shared File System that is used by SMAPI The SMAPI request servers and worker servers use Shared File System (SFS) directories to access configuration files and other data. SMAPI uses the standard file pool VMSYS and VMPSFS to keep their files. The VSMWORK1 user ID is the owner of some of the SFS directories that have control files, logs, and so on. The SFS directories are defined on SFS file pools. The authorization and ownership for the SFS directories are done by using enroll SFS commands. You can set AUDIT parameter on DSMPARMS file for auditing purpose. All commands that are shown in this chapter regarding SFS ENROLL and GRANT are performed automatically during z/VM installation. They are shown here for verification and testing purposes. Also, if you are adding a worker or request server, you can use the appropriate commands from these lists as a guide for enrolling your new server in the correct file pool and then grant SFS authorizations. Example 10-9 SFS",

The default method is through a manual process where you update a file that is called USER DIRECT, which is the z/VM system directory. After installing DirMaint, it will be doing the user ID and resource management on z/VM directory. A virtual machine definition is a grouping of directory statements that begin with the term USER or IDENTITY as shown in Example 10-13. For more information, a description of virtual machine types, and the USER and IDENTITY statements, see Chapter 1 of z/VM Getting Started with Linux on System z, SC24-6194. Example 10-13 z/VM",

The available hardware types are count key data (CKD) disks with a Fibre Channel connection (FICON), and Fibre Channel (FC) disks. Several methodologies are possible to configure both types. 11.2.1 Direct-attached storage devices (DASD) Extended count key data (ECKD) DASD is the traditional disk storage hardware for use on the mainframe.

Emulated DASD characteristics The following differences exist between direct-attached FCP and EDEVs: \u0002 EDEVs are based on FCP; therefore, they need a pair of FCP adapters for you to configure this disk type. \u0002 Each of the LUNs that are available to the FCP adapters that are configured for EDEV maps to a single DASD device. Although this setup is only available within z/VM, it is still called rdev in that environment. \u0002 Multipathing is configured in z/VM, and the virtual machine systems are not aware of this multipathing. \u0002 The resulting DASDs are fixed-block architecture (FBA) type instead of CKD, and have a default block size of 512 bytes instead of 4k bytes. \u0002 The sizes of EDEVs are determined by the sizes of the volume groups of the storage device only. No correlation exists to 3390 DASD models. \u0002 The IPL of EDEV works like the IPL on",

The groundwork for the use of the VSWITCH interfaces was set up and configured as part of the shared user profiles. 11.3.2 Direct-attached Open Systems Adapter Linux uses the identical drivers to run a direct-attached Open Systems Adapter (OSA) that it uses to run VSWITCH interfaces. With a direct-attached OSA, you tradeoff lower TCO, high availability, and stall prevention for a possible faster network",

An exceptionally small number of cases exist in which a direct-attached OSA is necessary when the VSWITCH uses 10 GiE uplinks. Important: The direct-attached OSA configuration is not a recommended configuration. Use it with extreme caution. It is a single point of failure in an otherwise highly available environment. It can also become packed and stall, which triggers rollbacks or failures in fault-intolerant consumers. The VSWITCH does not exhibit this weakness and remains the recommended method. 362 Virtualization Cookbook: Vol 1: IBM z/VM 7.2 11.3.3 Configuring z/VM to provide direct-attached OSA interfaces The configuration that is needed to provide OSA interfaces to a virtual machine is basically the same as dedicating three suitable OSA device addresses to the virtual machine.

To monitor Linux performance data directly from the kernel, the following statements must be true: \u0002 The APPLMON option must be set in the user directory. \u0002 Applmon data monitoring must be built into the kernel. The first requirement typically is true because the OPTION APPLMON was set for the Linux virtual machines in earlier sections. For the second requirement, this feature is built into both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Server and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). Complete the following steps to use this built-in monitoring function: 1. Start a Secure Shell (SSH) session to a Linux system. In this example, LINUX3 is used. 2. Three modules are built into the kernel but they are not loaded, by default. They are named appldata_mem, appldata_os, and appldata_net_sum. You can verify that they are not loaded with the lsmod and grep commands: # lsmod | grep appldata 3. No output",

Disk storage administration 401 13.1.3 Making new zFCP LUN available in Linux To use Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) in a single system image (SSI) environment, you must understand that within Linux, you need to handle more adapters than the adapters that are visible in only one SSI node. Fortunately, both SLES 15 and RHEL 8 changed the behavior of FCP to automatic logical unit number (LUN) detection. Therefore, it is sufficient to merely configure the host adapters and use the multipathed device only for disk configurations. This section assumes that no previous zFCP was available. The planning according to this manual creates two FCP adapters at the addresses 0.0.fc00 and 0.0.fd00. The necessary setup for z/VM is described in detail in 11.2.2, \u201cDirect-attached Fibre Channel\u201d on page 348. Follow these steps: 1. Start a Secure Shell (SSH)",

For example, if you want a shared /home/ directory, it must be a sufficient size for many users to write data to. You can use the LVM to combine multiple DASD volumes into one logical volume. This example does not create a large logical volume, but it shows all of the necessary steps. The following sections describe a logical volume with additional DASD on a Linux guest. Use the following overall steps in adding a logical volume. 13.2.1 Creating a logical volume and file system The following overall steps are involved in creating a logical volume: 1. Create physical volumes from the two partitions. 2. Create a single volume group. 3. Create a single logical volume. 4. Make a file system from the logical volume.

Disk storage administration 411 13.4 Moving a physical volume In addition to file systems that grow larger, you might need to move data off one or more volumes on to another or a target set of volumes. If your data is in LVM, the pvmove and vgreduce commands were designed for this process, and they can be used with the file system online. In this example, two physical volumes, /dev/dasde1 and /dev/dasdf1, exist. Data is populated on the first volume, and later moved to the second volume. This movement is performed while the file system is online. To complete this test, perform the following steps: 1. Create a volume group from the first logical volume. In this example, it is named homelv: # vgcreate homevg /dev/dasde1 Volume group \"homevg\" successfully created 2. Observe the number of physical extents: # vgdisplay homevg | grep \"Total PE\" Total PE 1760 3. Create a logical volume from the volume",

In port-based mode, a guest is granted access to connect to specific port numbers on a VSWITCH, and those ports might include different configured access characteristics.

This process shows that the HiperSockets device is working. 14.3 Configuring a port group by using Link Aggregation Control Protocol To aggregate multiple OSA-Express ports, port groups can be defined on z/VM and attached to a virtual switch. Traffic is distributed over the multiple ports automatically. The initial support for VSwitch Link Aggregation required that the OSA ports were used only by a single z/VM VSWITCH and were not shared with another system (even a Linux guest in the same LPAR attaching to the OSA directly). Later, the Multi-VSwitch Link Aggregation capability was introduced. This support, also known as Global VSwitch, allows a port group to be",

Working with networks 423 14.3.2 Multiple VSWITCH Link Aggregation As you can see from the previous example, exclusive-mode link aggregation does not scale over many z/VM systems. The Global VSwitch capability relieved this limitation by allowing link aggregation OSA ports to be shared between z/VM LPARs. To allow exclusive-mode link aggregation to scale over many z/VM systems, an IVL Domain is a group of up to 16 z/VM systems that can share link aggregation ports. Connectivity for IVL Domains is implemented over an Ethernet-based IVL Network, which is defined by using IVL VSwitches and OSA ports. Up to 16 z/VM systems can be part of an IVL Domain, and an IVL Network can support many IVL Domains. Up to eight Domains are supported without the use of VLANs on the IVL Network; up to eight Domains per IVL VLAN are supported with VLANs on the IVL Network). The ports used for the IVL Network must be separate from the link",

Through the IVL Domain, the port group is created on the second system when it is defined on the first system. Example 14-6 shows the commands that we issued on the first system to create the shared port group. First, we defined the group as a shared port group; then, we added the two OSA ports to the group.

Also, the MAC addresses in the ACTOR fields did not change, even though RDBKZVMC is no longer attached to the VSwitch. Instead of changing the MAC addresses, which is disruptive to LACP, the new controlling system (in this case RDBKZVMF) takes over the MAC addresses of RDBKZVMC\u2019s VSwitch to allow LACP to continue. This process happens internally in the port group because the MAC addresses do not appear in a QUERY VSWITCH DETAILS listing. 14.3.4 Link Aggregation Control Protocol When setting up VSwitch Link Aggregation, it is highly recommended that the network switch definition is set up for Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) operation.

The error reason \u201cLACP not enabled on partner\u201d is shown against both of the OSA ports in the group. Only an exclusive-mode port group can operate without LACP, and in that configuration, traffic for the group is distributed between the ports in the group without being managed by a control protocol. Depending on the operating characteristics of the network switch, this configuration might result in traffic not being handled optimally. Some modern network equipment can operate poorly and even experience traffic loss when traffic appears across different ports unexpectedly. Red Hat",

TOOLSRUN allows coordinated set-updates by multiple people to a single disk. The authority to update is based on the permissions granted to you. For more information about this EXEC, see this web page. 15.1.5 EDEVICE path management This description is taken from this IBM Products and Solutions web page. In managing EDEVs, their FCP CHIPIDs, and the SAN controllers hosting the LUNs, it is sometimes wanted to take a component out of service. For example, to apply service to a node of a V7000 SAN storage controller, it is first necessary to take the node out of the configuration. This amounts to removing all",

After the service is complete, it is desirable to put back the removed paths: \u0002 The EDEVPATH tool lets a class B user control the paths of the system\u2019s EDEVs en masse. The following functions are provided: \u0002 All of the paths that share a trait, such as a specific FCP CHPID, can be removed from the EDEVs\u2019 path configurations. The paths removed are recorded in a log file. \u0002 All of the paths that are removed by an invocation of the \u201cremove\u201d function can be returned. This process is done by reading the log file and undoing the logged removals. \u0002 A snapshot of the system's EDEVs\u2019 path configurations can be collected. The package consists of an exec and a NAMES file. The exec\u2019s command line implements the remove, restore, and snapshot functions.

Miscellaneous recipes and helpful information 455 15.8 Mitigating SSH client timeout disconnects Often times when a firewall exists between your workstation and a Linux server, sessions that are seen by the firewall as idle can be forcefully severed by the firewall, or even by Linux in some scenarios. This situation can be incredibly frustrating to someone who is trying to administer the system and is forced to focus their attention elsewhere for some amount of time.

Software installed on the Linux images must be serviced or updated, and there is no way to do this other than servicing each image as if it were a stand-alone server. IBM Z has the ability to share file systems as VM minidisks so there ought to be a way to install WebSphere once and use that installation for many other Linux images. This was previously impractical, because the installed WebSphere program files (which are read/only) and the user data files (which are read/write) were not identified and were intermixed in the same directories. WebSphere Version 6 introduced the concept of \u201cProfiles\u201d, which are created by the manage profiles command or graphically with the pmt.sh tool. Profiles must be created for all installations of WebSphere V6 and above, and contain all the user-writable files (logs, installed applications, etc.) for WebSphere.

So, with WebSphere V8.5.5.xthe WebSphere binaries are separate from the user data files in the same way as V6, V7 and V8. We can use this separation to allow profiles to share the WebSphere binaries not only on the same server, but across many servers.The methods and procedures for sharing the WebSphere binaries in V8.5.5.xdiffer little from V8. See the following section on what is different for those administrators that are already familiar with the sharing concepts in V8 of this paper.
